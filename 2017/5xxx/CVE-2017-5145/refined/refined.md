The provided content is related to CVE-2017-5145.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper CSRF protection in the web interface of the Carlo Gavazzi VMU-C EM and VMU-C PV devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The web interface is susceptible to CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to execute unauthorized actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows attackers to make unauthorized changes to the device's configuration parameters.
*   Attackers can save modified configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based.
*   An attacker could trick a user into loading a malicious webpage or link, which then sends requests to the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
*   No authentication is required to perform the attack.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, but must be able to send requests to the targeted device.
