Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper TLS certificate validation within the "State Bank Anywhere" mobile application for iOS. The application does not properly verify the TLS certificate of the server it is connecting to. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to present a fraudulent certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate TLS Certificate Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the TLS certificate presented by the server, making it vulnerable to MitM attacks.
*   **Data-in-Transit Vulnerability:** Due to the lack of proper certificate validation, sensitive data transmitted by the app is susceptible to interception by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can intercept the username and password during the login process. The password is sent in the form of both an MD5 hash and a SHA1 hash.
*   **Account Takeover:** With stolen credentials, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's bank account and perform malicious actions.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker may also be able to manipulate data sent to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the user's device and the bank's server can intercept network traffic. This can be achieved by:
    *   Being within Wi-Fi range of the user.
    *   Compromising a device already connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
    *   Compromising the user's VPN provider or gateway (if applicable).
    *   Compromising the user's ISP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be physically proximate (e.g. within Wi-Fi range) or have a privileged network position relative to the victim.
*   **Network Control:** The attacker needs some level of control over network traffic between the user's device and the server.
*   **Ability to generate fake certificates:** The attacker needs the ability to generate invalid TLS certificates for the server the app intends to connect to, not signed by a valid certificate authority.

**Specific Details:**

*   The affected application is "State Bank Anywhere" by State Bank of India.
*   The vulnerable version is 5.1.0.
*   The data confirmed to be vulnerable to interception includes the username and the password in the form of both an MD5 hash and a SHA1 hash transmitted to `m.onlinesbi.com/middleware/MWServlet`.
*   The article states that the most recent version of the application makes it difficult to verify whether the vulnerability has been fixed or not.
