## Description

[![@bestshow](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5211744?v=4&size=48)](/bestshow)[bestshow](https://github.com/bestshow)opened [on Jan 9, 2017](https://github.com/justinhunt/moodle-filter_poodll/issues/23#issue-199513702)

Hello:

Moodle 3.1.3+ Plugin “PoodLL Filter” – Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)

Procuct: Moodle plugin “PoodLL Filter”

Download url: <https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_poodll>

Vunlerable Version: 3.0.20 and probably prior

Tested Version: 3.0.20

Author: ADLab of Venustech

Advisory Details:

I have discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Moodle plugin “PoodLL Filter”, which can be exploited to add,modify or delete information in application`s database and gain complete control over the application.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficientfiltration of user-supplied data in “poodll\_audio\_url” HTTP GET parameter passed to “filter\_poodll\_moodle32\_2016112802/poodll/mp3recorderskins/brazil/index.php” url. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation examples below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a pop-up messagebox:

POC:

[http://localhost/moodleplugins/filter\_poodll\_moodle32\_2016112802/poodll/mp3recorderskins/brazil/index.php?poodll\_audio\_url=%22%27});%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E#%22](http://localhost/moodleplugins/filter_poodll_moodle32_2016112802/poodll/mp3recorderskins/brazil/index.php?poodll_audio_url=%22%27%7D);%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E#%22)
