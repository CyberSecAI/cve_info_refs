Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `author.control.php` file of GeniXCMS. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `$_GET['type']` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The code constructs an SQL query by directly concatenating the value of the `$_GET['type']` parameter into the `WHERE` clause. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Information disclosure:** The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials and other confidential data.
- **Complete compromise of the application:** In severe cases, an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the server by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `type` parameter in the HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `type` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection in `author.control.php`.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**More Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection by using a specially crafted `type` parameter. This PoC is designed to extract database information (specifically the database user in this case).
- The SQL query within the `author.control.php` file concatenates the user-provided value of `$_GET['type']` into a string used within the SQL query.  This string is used in the `WHERE` clause of the query.
- The PoC uses SQL functions like `CONCAT`, `MID`, `IFNULL`, `CAST`, and `CURRENT_USER()` to extract and manipulate database information, demonstrating the severity of the SQL injection.
