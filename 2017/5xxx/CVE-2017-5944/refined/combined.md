We have discovered security vulnerabilities which affect RT 4.0.x, RT 4.2.x, RT 4.4.x, and the RT::Authen::ExternalAuth extension. We are in the process of public testing of RT versions 4.0.25, 4.2.14, and 4.4.2 which resolve these vulnerabilities. In the meantime we are providing patches which apply atop all released versions of 4.0, 4.2, and 4.4. Additionally we are releasing RT::Authen::ExternalAuth 0.27 and providing a patch for versions 0.09 (released in 2011) and later.

The vulnerabilities addressed by 4.0.25, 4.2.14, 4.4.2, ExternalAuth 0.27 and the below patches include the following:

* RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to an information leak of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) verification tokens if a user visits a specific URL crafted by an attacker. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-5943. It was discovered by a third-party security researcher.
* RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack if an attacker uploads a malicious file with a certain content type. Installations which use the AlwaysDownloadAttachments config setting are unaffected. This fix addresses all existant and future uploaded attachments. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2016-6127. This was responsibly disclosed to us first by Scott Russo and the GE Application Security Assessment Team.
* One of RTâ€™s dependencies, a Perl module named Email::Address, has a denial of service vulnerability which could induce a denial of service of RT itself. We recommend administrators install Email::Address version 1.908 or above, though we additionally provide a new workaround within RT. The Email::Address vulnerability was assigned CVE-2015-7686. This vulnerabilityâ€™s application to RT was brought to our attention by Pali RohÃ¡r.
* RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks for user passwords. By carefully measuring millions or billions of login attempts, an attacker could crack a userâ€™s password even over the internet. RT now uses a constant-time comparison algorithm for secrets to thwart such attacks. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-5361. This was responsibly disclosed to us by Aaron Kondziela.
* RTâ€™s ExternalAuth feature is vulnerable to a similar timing side-channel attack. Both RT 4.0/4.2 with the widely-deployed RT::Authen::ExternalAuth extension, as well as the core ExternalAuth feature in RT 4.4 are vulnerable. Installations which donâ€™t use ExternalAuth, or which use ExternalAuth for LDAP/ActiveDirectory authentication, or which use ExternalAuth for cookie-based authentication, are unaffected. Only ExternalAuth in DBI (database) mode is vulnerable.
* RT 4.0.0 and above are potentially vulnerable to a remote code execution attack in the dashboard subscription interface. A privileged attackercan cause unexpected code to be executed through carefully-crafted saved search names. Though we have not been able to demonstrate an actual attack owing to other defenses in place, it could be possible. This fix addresses all existant and future saved searches. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-5944. It was discovered by an internal security audit.
* RT 4.0.0 and above have misleading documentation which could reduce system security. The RestrictLoginReferrer config setting (which has security implications) was inconsistent with its implementation, which checked for a slightly different variable name. RT will now check for the incorrect name and produce an error message. This was responsibly disclosed to us by Alex Vandiver.
* Patches for all releases of 4.0.x and 4.2.x are available for download below. Versions of RT older than 4.0.0 are unsupported and do not receive security patches; please contact sales@bestpractical.com if you need assistance with an older RT version.

Package        : request-tracker4
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-6127 CVE-2017-5361 CVE-2017-5943 CVE-2017-5944

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an
extensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2016-6127

    It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to a cross-site
    scripting (XSS) attack if an attacker uploads a malicious file with
    a certain content type. Installations which use the
    AlwaysDownloadAttachments config setting are unaffected by this
    flaw. The applied fix addresses all existant and future uploaded
    attachments.

CVE-2017-5361

    It was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to timing
    side-channel attacks for user passwords.

CVE-2017-5943

    It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to an information
    leak of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) verification tokens if a
    user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted URL by an
    attacker.

CVE-2017-5944

    It was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to a remote code
    execution vulnerability in the dashboard subscription interface. A
    privileged attacker can take advantage of this flaw through
    carefully-crafted saved search names to cause unexpected code to be
    executed. The applied fix addresses all existant and future saved
    searches.

Additionally to the above mentioned CVEs, this update workarounds
CVE-2015-7686 in Email::Address which could induce a denial of service
of Request Tracker itself.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.8-3+deb8u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.4.1-3+deb9u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.
