The provided content is related to CVE-2017-5621.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Zammad did not properly sanitize user input in chat messages or ticket article contents. Malicious HTML sent through the REST or WebSocket API could be executed within the application's domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization for user-provided content in chat messages and ticket articles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary code within the application's domain, allowing an attacker to potentially perform actions with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content. This could include data theft, session hijacking, or further compromise of the application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending malicious HTML via the REST API.
- Sending malicious HTML via the WebSocket API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious HTML content via the REST or WebSocket API, typically by interacting with the chat or ticket system.
