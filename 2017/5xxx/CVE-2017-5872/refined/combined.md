| | Vulnerability Report - ClearPath MCP TCP/IP Networking dumps when parsing TLS v1.2 client hello with newer signature algorithms | | --- |      |  | | | --- | --- | |  | | | Unisys ID: | **UIS-2017-2** | | Status: | Published | | CVE-ID: | CVE-2017-5872 | | Affected Product: | TCP-IP-SW | | Affected Version: | 57.1, 58.1, 59.1 | | Impact: | HIGH | | CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 | | CVSS v3.1 Vector: | **CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C**  [v3 Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) | | CVSS v2.0 Base Score: |  | | CVSS v2.0 Vector: | Not Supplied  [v2 Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculator) | | CVSS Temporal Score: | 7.2 | | --- | --- | | Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE): |  | | Common Platform Enumeration (CPE): |  | | Source: | Client Reported | | Keyword(s): | CVE-2017-5872 | | Vulnerability Description: | | | The TCP/IP networking module of ClearPath MCP creates a full memory dump when a TLS v1.2 client hello is received with a signature\_algorithms extension with values above what is defined in the RFC 5246 specification. TCP/IP networking is inoperable until a reboot of the system is completed. | | | System Configuration: | | | ClearPath MCP system running 57.1 Networking (before 57.159) or 58.1 Networking (before 58.157) or 59.1 (before 59.1 IC 12 of TCP-IP-SW) and at least one service offering secured connections via SSL/TLS. | | | Impact of Exploiting Vulnerability: | | | Network communication stops, and the system must be rebooted to restore full network connectivity. | | | Remediation Description: | | | Upgrade to TCP-IP-SW version 57.159, 58.157, or 59.189.8014 (IC 12 of TCP-IP-SW). | | | Workaround Information: | | | Configure the client to either only use RFC 5246 specified signature\_algorithms or set the maximum value for SSL/TLS version to TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 (which do not require the signature\_algorithms extension). | | | References: | | | PLE 19177271, PLE 19199801 | | | Additional Vendor Comment: | | |  | |  |  | | --- |  |  | | --- | |  | | |  | | *Disclaimer:*  *Unisys Corporation provides the information in this Security Vulnerability Report “AS IS.” No warranties of any nature are extended by or for the information.
