- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ClearPath MCP TCP/IP networking module creates a full memory dump when it receives a TLS v1.2 client hello with a `signature_algorithms` extension containing values beyond those defined in RFC 5246.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of TLS extensions, specifically the `signature_algorithms` extension in a TLS v1.2 client hello message. The system does not properly handle values outside the range specified in RFC 5246, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The TCP/IP networking module becomes inoperable, halting all network communication. The system requires a reboot to restore full network connectivity, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious client sends a TLS v1.2 client hello message with an invalid `signature_algorithms` extension to a vulnerable ClearPath MCP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection with a vulnerable ClearPath MCP system offering secured connections via SSL/TLS and needs to be able to send specifically crafted TLS handshake messages.
