  "CVE-2017-5450": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Address bar spoofing on Android using javascript: URI.",
    "details": "A mechanism to spoof the Firefox for Android addressbar using a `javascript:` URI. On Firefox for Android, the base domain is parsed incorrectly, making the resulting location less visibly a spoofed site and showing an incorrect domain in appended notifications.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect parsing of the base domain from a `javascript:` URI.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect parsing of the base domain from a javascript URI",
       "Improper handling of URLs with non-standard protocols",
       "Lack of consistent base domain extraction across different URI schemes"
    ],
    "impact": "Address bar spoofing on Firefox for Android, leading to potential phishing or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted javascript: URI",
      "User interaction by opening a malicious link"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a `javascript:` URI with a malicious domain embedded within it.",
    "additional_notes": [
       "The vulnerability exists in how the base domain is extracted and displayed in Firefox for Android, specifically when dealing with `javascript:` URIs.",
       "The fix involves using the principal URI's host to determine the base domain, and to use `Services.eTLD.getBaseDomainFromHost`"
    ]
