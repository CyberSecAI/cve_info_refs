Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `plist_free_data` function within `plist.c` at line 185. The code attempts to free memory that was not properly allocated, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The `plist_free_data` function attempts to free memory that might have already been freed or was never allocated. This leads to a crash when the program tries to access the memory location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Segmentation Fault (SEGV):** Exploitation leads to a segmentation fault, causing the application to crash. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious plist file:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a crafted binary plist file with specific structure that causes the `plist_free_data` to be called on invalid memory. The provided sample base64 encoded plist data illustrates this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted plist file to be processed by the vulnerable application (e.g. through plistutil tool).

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified using AddressSanitizer, which detected the SEGV (segmentation violation) during the `free` operation within `plist_free_data`.
- The call stack shows that the crash originates from `plist_free_data`, which is called during the plist deallocation process.
- The provided stack trace highlights the sequence of function calls during parsing the binary plist file, eventually leading to the problematic free call.
- This vulnerability is present in `libplist`, a library used to handle Apple Property List format.

The provided information gives a good overview of the root cause and impact.
