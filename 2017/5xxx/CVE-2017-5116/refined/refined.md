  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A type confusion vulnerability exists in the V8 JavaScript engine due to a race condition when using SharedArrayBuffer, WebAssembly, and web workers. Specifically, when WebAssembly code is put into a SharedArrayBuffer and transferred to a web worker, the main thread and worker thread can concurrently access it. During the parsing process in main thread, the worker thread can modify the code, resulting in an out-of-bounds access.",

    "impact": "A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the sandboxed Chrome render process.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious web page that utilizes SharedArrayBuffer, WebAssembly, and web workers, an attacker can trigger the race condition leading to type confusion and code execution.",
