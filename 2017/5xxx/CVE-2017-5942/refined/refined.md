- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `replyto` parameter in the WP Mail plugin's mail composition functionality is not properly sanitized before being outputted into the `value` attribute of an input field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page with the crafted URL. This can lead to actions performed with the victim's permissions, such as session hijacking, redirecting to malicious websites, or performing other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the `replyto` parameter. The victim must then visit this specially crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and somehow convince the victim to click this link when logged into the affected WordPress application.
