{
  "CVE-2017-5448": {
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds write in ClearKeyDecryptor while decrypting some Clearkey-encrypted media content. The ClearKeyDecryptor code runs within the Gecko Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox. If a second mechanism is found to escape the sandbox, this vulnerability allows for the writing of arbitrary data within memory, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow vulnerability in ClearKeyDecryptor during decryption of Clearkey-encrypted media content due to a lack of proper bounds checking. This overflow can occur when calculating buffer sizes for handling encrypted subsamples.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary data can be written to memory, which may lead to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious media file with specially crafted subsample metadata.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious media file to the vulnerable software and requires a separate mechanism to escape the Gecko Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox to fully exploit the vulnerability for arbitrary code execution.  The vulnerability itself exists inside the sandbox but can be leveraged to write arbitrary data to memory which could be used in conjunction with a sandbox escape."
