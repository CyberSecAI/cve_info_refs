Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `coders/mpc.c` file within ImageMagick. This leak occurs during the handling of MPC (Magick Persistent Cache) files when creating the image colormap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: The code allocates memory for the colormap but does not properly deallocate it in certain scenarios, specifically when the `SyncImagePixelCache()` function is called, which results in a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can exploit this memory leak by processing maliciously crafted MPC files. This repeated memory allocation without proper deallocation leads to excessive memory consumption, eventually resulting in a denial-of-service condition due to the exhaustion of available memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious MPC File: The primary attack vector is a specially crafted MPC file that, when processed by ImageMagick, triggers the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Provide Input: An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted MPC file to a vulnerable ImageMagick instance. This could be through a web service, file upload, or any other application that uses ImageMagick to process images.
- No specific position is required as long as the attacker has the means to submit the malicious MPC file to the target system/application using the vulnerable ImageMagick version.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in ImageMagick versions before 6.9.7-4 and 7.x before 7.0.4-4
- The fix involves allocating image colormap within the MPC module to avoid spurious calls to SyncImagePixelCache().

This extracted information provides more specific details than the CVE description itself, which primarily states a generic memory consumption issue.
