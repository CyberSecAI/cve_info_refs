Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `cgiemail` and `cgiecho` binaries have a vulnerability related to how they handle the `success` and `failure` parameters. This allows for an open redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The applications do not properly validate or sanitize the `success` and `failure` parameters, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the manipulation of the `success` and `failure` parameters of `cgiemail` and `cgiecho`. The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing these parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL used to access the vulnerable `cgiemail` or `cgiecho` scripts/binaries. This usually involves getting the victim to click a specially crafted URL.
