The provided content describes two zero-day vulnerabilities in IP cameras. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **Authentication bypass and Information disclosure:** The first vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and request any file in the web server folder. This allows access to sensitive information like the camera's password.
*   **Web server command injection:** The second vulnerability allows for command injection via the web server due to the web server running as root.
*   **Password complexity flaw:** A logical flaw in the password setting mechanism allows only all number or all lowercase or all uppercase passwords to be set, making password cracking easier.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Allows unauthorized access to the web server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposes sensitive data like the camera's password.
*   **Command Injection:** Enables arbitrary command execution on the device.
*   **Insecure Password Implementation:** Weak password restriction logic which limits the possible characters allowed in the password.
*   **Root Web Server:** Web server runs as root leading to root command execution via command injection vulnerability.
*   **Outdated Software:** Cameras are running outdated software, including a web server from 2002.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full Camera Control:** Attackers can move the camera, view its feed, and alter the video stream.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute malicious code on the camera.
*   **Botnet Creation:** Attackers can use the vulnerabilities to create large botnets using the cameras to perform DDoS attacks and other malicious activities.
*   **Network Pivot Point:** Attackers can potentially use the camera as a pivot point to access the internal network.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** Exploitation occurs through the web interface of the IP camera using the discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Internet Exposure:** Cameras are directly exposed to the internet, making them accessible to attackers.
*   **Shodan/Censys:** Search engines can be used to identify vulnerable devices connected to the internet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable camera, which could mean direct internet access.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs technical knowledge to exploit the authentication bypass, information disclosure, and command injection vulnerabilities.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerabilities are present in multiple camera brands, all of which are based on the same software, and were assembled by the same company.
*   The camera software does not have an update mechanism and are difficult to patch, so the main solution is to discard the affected devices.
*   The identified vulnerable cameras include models from Vstarcam, which was specifically named in the article.
* The article provided a list of serial number prefixes that are affected by this vulnerability.
* A tool was developed to identify vulnerable cameras.
