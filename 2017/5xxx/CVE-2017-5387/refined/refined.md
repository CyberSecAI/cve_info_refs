Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5387:

**CVE Description:**

The provided content includes the following description of the vulnerability:

> The existence of a specifically requested local file can be found due to the double firing of the `onerror` when the `source` attribute on a `<track>` tag refers to a file that does not exist if the source page is loaded locally.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an inconsistency in how the `onerror` event is triggered for `<track>` elements. Specifically, the event fires twice when the referenced file in the `src` attribute doesn't exist, and only once when the file exists but is not playable. This behavior allows an attacker to differentiate between the two scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The inconsistent behavior of the `onerror` event allows an attacker to determine whether a file exists on the local filesystem by observing how many times the `onerror` event is triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local File System Enumeration:** An attacker can use this to probe for the existence of files on the victim's local file system if the attacker can get a locally loaded page to run.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local HTML File:** The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious HTML file is loaded from the local file system. The attacker crafts an HTML file containing a `<track>` tag pointing to a file they want to probe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the capability to serve a malicious HTML file from the local file system, for example by tricking a user into downloading an HTML file and opening it.

**Additional Details from Content:**
*   **`track` element:** The vulnerability is specifically related to the behavior of the `<track>` HTML element and its `onerror` event.
*   **`file:///` protocol**: The vulnerability is only exploitable when the source page using the `<track>` tag is loaded via the `file:///` protocol. This indicates that web pages loaded from a server do not present this vulnerability due to security restrictions.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves ignoring the ready state and preventing the double firing of the `onerror` event.
*  **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as `sec-low` because of the need for local file access.
*   **Public Visibility:** This is a publicly visible bug.
*   **Patch:**  The patch for this vulnerability is in the provided content and involves a code change to ignore setting the same value for the ready state which causes the event to fire twice. The code was committed to mozilla-central with the commit hash `305892e22d9c`.
*  **Related Bug:**  The bug report mentions a similar issue that was rated sec-moderate and rewarded a bounty. This implies the context of how this vulnerability is seen in relation to others.
*   **Test Case:** A test case is provided as an HTML file (`ff-file-enumeration.html`) to demonstrate the vulnerability.
