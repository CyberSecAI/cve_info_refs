| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160726073904
Steps to reproduce:
[A demonstration video will be uploaded to show you the malicious result of this security bug]
-----
Step1 : Go to <http://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/~F5g9M-Addressbar-Spoofing-j3U7k~/index-start.html>
-----
Step2 : Go down into this webpage (the location bar disappears) , during this event a malicious webpage which is slow to load will start its loading without that the Location Bar shows its web address (and the Location Bar remains hidden).
(During the slow loading of the malicious website, a link specially crafted can be clicked).
<!>Step2 INFO : The loading time of the malicious webpage is 9 seconds when you go on the testcase link ( <http://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/~F5g9M-Addressbar-Spoofing-j3U7k~/index-start.html> ) but can be changed by a bigger loading time. (The PHP code of the "redirect-and-sleep().php" can be changed by a bigger or smaller loading time).<!>
-----
Step3 : After going down into the webpage "index-start.html", the user can click on the link "<https://www.google.fr>" (before the loading of the malicious webpage which is 9 seconds ) or wait the loading of the malicious website after the scrolling down.
-----
Actual results:
A faked Location Bar is shown instead the true location bar which remains hidden.
When you go on a webpage specially crafted which uses a slow loading to a malicious webpage/website during you scroll down into this first webpage, the Location Bar disappears (even if another website/webpage is loaded), if an user clicks on a link which hasn't effect (crafted specially to mislead the user which thinks that the link goes on the website indicated or of its choice) the Location Bar is always invisible when the malicious Webpage is loaded and this malicious webpage contains a faked Location Bar leading to a Location Bar URL / SSL Spoofing Risk.
Expected results:
The Location Bar should reappear and be always visible when another webpage is loaded but it is not the case for this security bug.
When a webpage is slowly loaded by another webpage, and even if you go down on this webpage (manually scroll down) and that the Location Bar disappears , The Location Bar should be normally visible when another webpage is loaded.
The Location Bar should be always visible when another website or another webpage is loaded.

A bunch of things have to happen so that this works:
\* The user has to scroll the page to hide the actual toolbar
\* A slow load of the next page has to be started before the scrolling happens
\* The user needs to be tricked into clicking a non-functional link before the slow load has finished (To think the new page was loaded because of the click)
\* The user has to interact with the fake website in a way that the actual toolbar is not revealed (no scrolling)
\* (The website/toolbar has to be specifically crafted to work on all devices. The current demo does not really work on a Nexus 6P: The toolbar is tiny. But this doesn't matter for the sake of the demo.)
Normally we show the toolbar when a location change is happening. But here the location change is happening instantly (<body onload="">) and the scrolling happens afterwards while the request to load the page is sloooooow.
Chrome seems to have the same problem with the exception that they will reveal the toolbar as soon as the user focuses a text input and the keyboard comes up. This makes a lot of sense: As soon as you enter text on a webpage you might want to know on what page you actually are.
Apart from that I do not know how we could prevent this, except for showing the toolbar on an actual "new page arrived" event instead of a location changed event (Do we have any event like that? It shouldn't trigger when the page changes dynamically).

This would be great. I've a bunch of things to look into and I don't know much about the form and toolbar (the scrolling part) code yet. Randall, do you have time for that?Flags: needinfo?(s.kaspari) â†’ needinfo?(rbarker)

â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8787514&action=edit)

This new testcase version (TesCase2) is more convincing to trap an user.
Steps:
1) Go to <http://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/~H7G5F-Firefox-Android_Addressbar-Spoofing_using-manually-scroll-down-and-a-slow-redirect-to-malicious-website~/index-step1.html> and click on the "ClickMe" link (a new tab is opened with a Google webpage ( <https://www.google.com/>?[...] )
2) scroll down manually on this Google webpage (during this scroll event , a slow loading of a malicious webpage is defined after the loading of the Google webpage.
Results:
The Location Bar is hidden and a fake location bar is showed (instead the real location bar) with a fake SSL indicator and a fake google URL (<https://www.google.com>).
I Upload immediately a a video example to show how this testcase works exactly.

I think that this new testcase doesn't require a new/different fix but this testcase seems to be a spoofing more convincing than the previous testcases.

Attached file
[ff-file-enumeration.html](attachment.cgi?id=8780916)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8780916&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0
Build ID: 20160802213348
Steps to reproduce:
The issue exists because a <track> tag's onerror event is triggered twice if the file referenced in it's src attribute doesn't exist, while it's only triggered once if the file exists but not playable.
Please check the attached file for a PoC. Change the path to the file in the src attribute in the <track> tag for the different behaviors explained.
Actual results:
The onerror event for the <track> tag is fired twice if the file doesn't exist and once if it does.
Expected results:
The onerror event should be fired the same number of times for both cases.

This works as a local attack only--that is, when the PoC is itself loaded from a file:/// url. From a web page you always get a "doesn't exist" result because there's a security error thrown:

Excuse me, but why is this case considered sec-low, while the bug described here <http://leucosite.com/FireFox-Check-If-Local-File-Folder-Exists-Using-Jar-URI-Scheme/> is about the same class of issues, and even the POC itself has to be loaded via the file:// protocol, yet it was considered sec-moderate and was even rewarded a bounty ?

##### Description

Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) files can specify a JavaScript function called for all URL requests with the full URL path which exposes more information than would be sent to the proxy itself in the case of HTTPS. Normally the Proxy Auto-Config file is specified by the user or machine owner and presumed to be non-malicious, but if a user has enabled Web Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD) this file can be served remotely.
