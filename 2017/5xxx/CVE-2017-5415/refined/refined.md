{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-5415",
  "description": "An attack can use a blob URL and script to spoof an arbitrary addressbar URL prefaced by `blob:` as the protocol, leading to user confusion and further spoofing attacks.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to change the location.pathname within a blob URL context, which can lead to address bar spoofing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Address bar spoofing",
      "Incorrect URI handling of blob URLs"
    ],
    "impact": "User confusion and potential for further spoofing attacks. An attacker can make the address bar display a URL different from the actual page loaded, potentially misleading the user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious web page loads a blob URL.",
       "Script within the blob URL changes `location.pathname` to a spoofed value."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious web page or control a web page that can execute JavaScript to create and manipulate blob URLs. They would also need to entice a user to interact with this page."
