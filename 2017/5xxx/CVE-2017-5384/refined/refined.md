Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5384:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2017-5384**, as evidenced by the bug report [Bug 1255474](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1255474) which is explicitly labeled with the alias "CVE-2017-5384." The bug report description and comments align with the official CVE description relating to information disclosure via PAC files. Additionally the advisory page mentions [Bug 1255474](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1255474) as the fix for this CVE

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the `FindProxyForURL` function in Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) files receives the full URL, including the path and query string, for both HTTP and HTTPS requests. This exposes more information than necessary to the PAC script.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The full URL, including potentially sensitive data in the query string, is exposed to the PAC script.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack Potential:** If a user is configured with a malicious PAC file (especially through Web Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD)), an attacker can intercept and leak the full URLs.
- **Bypassing HTTPS Encryption:** The full URL is passed to the PAC script before HTTPS encryption, enabling an attacker to see it.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Leakage:** Attackers can steal sensitive data from HTTPS URLs, such as credentials, tokens, search terms, or any other information passed in the query string.
-   **Privacy Violation:** User browsing habits and accessed resources can be tracked.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PAC Files:** An attacker can provide a crafted PAC file to a victim's browser. This can be done through:
    - **Man-in-the-Middle:** Intercepting network traffic and injecting a malicious PAC file.
    - **WPAD:** If a user has Web Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD) enabled, a malicious actor on the network could host and serve a malicious PAC file.
-   **DNS Poisoning:** To capture leaked data, attackers could use a malicious DNS server and log requests based on the URLs extracted from the PAC script's dnsResolve calls

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have a position on the network to intercept traffic (e.g., as a malicious gateway) or manipulate WPAD responses.
-   **PAC File Configuration:** The attacker needs to trick the user or their organization into using a malicious PAC file or be able to serve one over the network if WPAD is enabled
-   **Ability to Run a DNS Server:**  To capture the leaked URLs via dnsResolve calls.

**Technical Details from the Bugzilla Entries:**

- The vulnerability exists because Firefox passes the full URL (including path and query parameters) to the `FindProxyForURL` JavaScript function in PAC files.
-   The fix implemented involves truncating the URL before passing it to the PAC script, keeping the protocol and host, and optionally the first character of the path if it exists, by default.
-   A preference (`network.proxy.autoconfig_url.include_path`) was introduced to restore the old behavior of passing the full URL, but this pref was found to not be working as intended in Firefox 51 and was fixed in a later version.
-   The patch was initially backed out due to test failures but was later corrected.
- The fix followed the implementation in Chrome for compatibility.
