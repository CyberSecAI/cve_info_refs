{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The cnPilot devices' web interface exposes a file path traversal vulnerability in the Readfile CGI script, specifically when handling the ping and traceroute functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "File path traversal vulnerability",
      "Lack of input sanitization in the Readfile CGI script"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker, with an authenticated low-privilege user account, can gain access to sensitive operating system files, potentially including the password for the `admin` user. This can allow the attacker to take full control of the device and the entire WiFi network it serves.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is initiated via crafted HTTP GET requests to the `Readfile` CGI script, specifying a file path with traversal sequences, such as `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a valid username and password for a cnPilot device to exploit the vulnerability via the web management interface. Access to the local network where the device resides is required."
