{
  "CVE-2017-5461": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in PL_Base64MaxDecodedLength() and PL_Base64MaxEncodedLength() within the NSS library.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient buffer allocation during Base64 de/encoding.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could craft a specially crafted input that, when processed by NSS, would cause a buffer overflow leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application linked against NSS.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack can be triggered through any input that is processed through the base64 encoder/decoder, including user-supplied data or certificates.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a sufficiently long encoded string to the vulnerable base64 de/encoding function."
