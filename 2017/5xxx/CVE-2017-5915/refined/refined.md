The provided content includes information about CVE-2017-5915.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper TLS certificate validation within the mobile application. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the TLS certificate presented by the server, or has certificate validation turned off by the developers. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to present a fraudulent certificate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation.
- The application does not verify the authenticity of the server it is communicating with, thus accepting potentially invalid certificates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept sensitive data transmitted between the mobile application and the server, such as login credentials (username and password) and potentially other sensitive information.
- The attacker could manipulate data being sent back to the device, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user's device and the application server. This can be achieved by being:
    - Within Wi-Fi range.
    - Having control of a device already connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
    - Having control of a VPN provider/gateway.
    - Or, being an Internet Service Provider.
- The attacker needs to be able to generate invalid TLS certificates for the targeted server.

**Specific to CVE-2017-5915:**

- The "Emirates NBD" and "Emirates NBD KSA" mobile applications (versions 3.10.0 through 3.10.4 for UAE and 2.0.1 through 2.1.0 for KSA) are vulnerable.
- Data transmitted to login.banknetpower.net is vulnerable to interception.
- Username and password were confirmed as vulnerable in the Saudi version.
- The UAE version uses an additional layer of custom encryption, but it is noted that an active MitM attacker could likely still gain access to credentials with manipulation.
- The vulnerability had not been fixed at the time of the article (May 4, 2017).
