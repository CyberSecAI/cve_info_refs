WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• The attacker must have network access for CVE-2017-5712 and local access for all other vulnera-

bilities. Siemens recommends operating the devices only within trusted networks.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Industrial PCs are the PC hardware platform for PC-based Automation from Siemens.

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop ﬂoor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

SIMOTION is a scalable high performance hardware and software system for motion control.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20171120-0001
**Version:**
1.0

**Last updated:**
11/20/2017

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2017-5705, CVE-2017-5708, CVE-2017-5711, CVE-2017-5712, CVE-2017-5706, CVE-2017-5709, CVE-2017-5707, CVE-2017-5710

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate Intel chipsets. IntelÂ® Management Engine (ME) firmware versions 11.0/11.5/11.6/11.7/11.10/11.20, IntelÂ® Server Platform Services (SPS) firmware version 4.0, and IntelÂ® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) firmware version 3.0 are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a platform, IntelÂ® ME features, and 3rd party secrets protected by the ME, SPS, or TXE. No NetApp products ship affected versions of the firmware.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impersonate the ME/SPS/TXE, thereby impacting local security feature attestation validity, load and execute arbitrary code outside the visibility of the user and operating system, or cause a system crash or system instability.

Intel is focused on ensuring the security of our customers computing environments. We are committed to rapidly addressing issues as they arise, and providing recommendations through security advisories and security [announcements](/content/www/us/en/security-center/announcement/default.html).

### Report a Vulnerability

If you have information about a security issue or vulnerability with an **Intel branded product or technology**, please send an e-mail to secure@intel.com. Encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP public key](/content/www/us/en/security-center/pgp-public-key.html).

Please provide as much information as possible, including:

* The products and versions affected
* Detailed description of the vulnerability
* Information on known exploits

A member of the Intel Product Security Team will review your e-mail and contact you to collaborate on resolving the issue. For more information on how Intel works to resolve security issues, see:

* [Vulnerability handling guidelines](/content/www/us/en/security-center/vulnerability-handling-guidelines.html)

For issues related to Intel's external web presence (Intel.com and related subdomains), please contact Intel's External Security Research team.

### Intel® Bug Bounty Program

Intel Corporation believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is a crucial part of identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in Intel products. Like other major technology companies, Intel incentivizes security researchers to report security vulnerabilities in Intel products to us to enable a coordinated response. To encourage closer collaboration with the security research community on these kinds of issues, Intel created its Bug Bounty Program. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in an Intel product or technology, we encourage you to notify us through our program and work with us to mitigate and to coordinate disclosure of the vulnerability.

Watch this video, [So You Found a Vulnerability](/content/www/us/en/security-center/so-you-found-a-vulnerability.html), to find out what you can expect when participating in the Intel® Bug Bounty Program.

# Synology-SA-17:73 Intel TXE and ME

Publish Time: 2017-11-22 18:23:20 UTC+8

Last Updated: 2021-04-19 14:23:40 UTC+8

Severity
Moderate

Status
Resolved

**Abstract**

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXE) and Intel Manageability Engine (ME). These vulnerabilities may allow local attackers to execute arbitrary code causing a denial-of-service attack or obtain sensitive information from a vulnerable version of Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).

Administrative privilege is required for these vulnerabilities to be exploited. Therefore, Synology has evaluated this issue to be of moderate severity.
