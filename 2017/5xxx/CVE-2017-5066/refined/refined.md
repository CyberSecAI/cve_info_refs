This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.\n\nChrome 58.0.3029.81 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/57.0.2987.133..58.0.3029.81?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming [Chrome](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) and [Chromium](http://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 58.\n## Security Fixes and Rewards\n\nNote: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.\n\nThis update includes [29](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3ARelease-0-M58) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers.

[Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). \u00a0If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). \u00a0The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.\n\nKrishna Govind\nGoogle Chrome\n\n![Share on
