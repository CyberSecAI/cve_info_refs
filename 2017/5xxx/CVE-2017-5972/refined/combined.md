# CVE-2017-5972

| **Name** | CVE-2017-5972 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties have been unable to discern any relationship between the GitHub Engineering finding and the Trigemini.c attack code. |

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Concerns about CVE-2017-5972

*From*: Wade Mealing <wmealing () redhat com>

```
Gday,

```

```

The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a
SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network
connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by
an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7.
---

This topic was covered by github[1], in which they chose to use
synsanity as a mitigation process.

After spending some time looking at this allocation, I was unable to
reproduce the initial findings on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
(based on 2.6.32) or 7 (based on 3.10) using direct host to host via
qemu or the e1000 driver as shown in the backtrace.  This with both
syn cookies enabled and disabled.

The backtrace provided shows that there is a slowpath in transmitting
ICMP reply packets which does not show the TCP syn cookie function in
the slowpath/backtrace.

I have attempted to performance profile this and found the syncookie
generation (under heavy syn attacks from multiple sources) did not
show significant impact on CPU performance compared to the packet
handling  in use.  I'm not saying its impossible I'm just saying the
backtrace doesn't match the events that are shown.

I -have- however been able to artificially recreate a very similar
backtrace through stuffing fake packets in with a kernel module and
created a hardening bug, however this seems unrelated as far as I can
see ( See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1428684> ).

The reproducer code is from a file called called "Trigemini.c" and is
found in several DDoS kits for at least the last 2 years, although
it's true origins are probably older, it is not possible to reproduce
or recreate on any scale I was able to test with.

I give Hosein a chance to talk more about his reproducer, in hope that
we can get a better understanding on how this was reproduced reliably.

Thank you

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1422081#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-02-14 12:41:47 UTC  ``` The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets.  The belief is that the system spends considerable time generating TCP syn cookies and creates a soft lockup in the system, reducing its ability to handle other requests.  This is as the syn cookie generation is serialized per system and not per CPU.  Other CPU's on the system can continue to work correctly.  References:  <https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2017020112> <https://githubengineering.com/syn-flood-mitigation-with-synsanity/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1422081#c2)  Wade Mealing    2017-03-03 04:34:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,6, 7 and MRG-2 kernels.  Red Hat has no plans to fix this issue at this time.  While performance enhancements have been made upstream, Red Hat Product Security believes the report to be invalid and able to be mitigated with synproxy.  This flaw is currently under investigation for validity and Red Hat is asking to revoke the CVE.   ``` |  |

The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN
cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack
against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties
have been unable to discern any relationship between the GitHub Engineering
finding and the Trigemini.c attack code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2017-02-20 16:12:28 UTC  ``` rh#1422081  The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7.  References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1422081> <https://githubengineering.com/syn-flood-mitigation-with-synsanity/> <https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2017020112> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2017-02-20 16:13:45 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/github/synsanity>  tool proposed ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2017-02-20 16:15:03 UTC  ``` This is more a hardening / remote synflood DOS protection measure topic. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2017-02-20 16:54:22 UTC  ``` interesting core part: In Linux 3.x, SYN cookies are generated inside a machine-wide lock on the LISTEN socket that the packet was destined for. This implementation causes all SYN cookies to be generated serially across all cores, defeating the benefits of a multi-processor system. To make matters worse, all cores spin waiting for the lock to become available. This was fine back in the days when an average attacker could only send a few MBits of SYN packets your way, mostly thanks to the networks being much slower. These days however, with servers attached to transit providers with multiple 10GB+ links the whole way down the line, it’s now possible to completely saturate CPU resources.  While Linux 4.x has a patch to send SYN cookies under a per-CPU-core socket lock, which does fix the problem, we wanted a solution that allowed us to use an existing, maintained kernel with upstream security patches. We didn’t want to roll and maintain an entire custom kernel and all related future security patches just to mitigate this form of attack. Patching Linux 3.x to backport the socket lock change was also a similar maintenance burden we wanted to avoid. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2017-02-20 23:00:14 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c5)  Michal Kubeček   2017-02-21 08:13:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c3)) > interesting core part: > In Linux 3.x, SYN cookies are generated inside a machine-wide lock on the > LISTEN socket that the packet was destined for.

While this should certainly improve overall TCP listener performance in high concurrency environments, I'm a bit sceptical about the claims that SYN cookie generating is the main problem here. I would really like to see some data from e.g. perf showing how much time is actually spent in the syncookie generating code. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2017-03-09 17:36:19 UTC  ``` on oss-sec  From: Wade Mealing <wmealing@redhat.com> Date: Thu, 9 Mar 2017 14:53:52 +1000 Subject: [oss-security] Concerns about CVE-2017-5972  Gday,  From the original description from Hosein Askari (CC'ed) :  --- The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. ---  This topic was covered by github[1], in which they chose to use synsanity as a mitigation process.  After spending some time looking at this allocation, I was unable to reproduce the initial findings on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (based on 2.6.32) or 7 (based on 3.10) using direct host to host via qemu or the e1000 driver as shown in the backtrace.  This with both syn cookies enabled and disabled.  The backtrace provided shows that there is a slowpath in transmitting ICMP reply packets which does not show the TCP syn cookie function in the slowpath/backtrace.  I have attempted to performance profile this and found the syncookie generation (under heavy syn attacks from multiple sources) did not show significant impact on CPU performance compared to the packet handling  in use.  I'm not saying its impossible I'm just saying the backtrace doesn't match the events that are shown.  I -have- however been able to artificially recreate a very similar backtrace through stuffing fake packets in with a kernel module and created a hardening bug, however this seems unrelated as far as I can see ( See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1428684> ).  The reproducer code is from a file called called "Trigemini.c" and is found in several DDoS kits for at least the last 2 years, although it's true origins are probably older, it is not possible to reproduce or recreate on any scale I was able to test with.  I give Hosein a chance to talk more about his reproducer, in hope that we can get a better understanding on how this was reproduced reliably.  Thank you  Wade Mealing Red Hat Product Security ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1026173#c9)  Marcus Meissner   2017-05-09 12:03:44 UTC  ``` We are not going to pursue this issue further currently.  We assume 4.x kernels are more protected against this denial of service. ``` |  |

| [Description](#c0)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2017-05-18 06:07:19 UTC  ``` CVE-2017-5972 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2017-5972>):   The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN   cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by   sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the   kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties have been   unable to discern any relationship between the GitHub Engineering finding   and the Trigemini.c attack code. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Christopher Díaz Riveros (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2018-03-11 00:54:30 UTC  ``` gentoo-sources-3.x no longer in portage tree. Marking as OBSOLETE ``` |  |

The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets, as demonstrated by an attack against the kernel-3.10.0 package in CentOS Linux 7. NOTE: third parties have been unable to discern any relationship between the GitHub Engineering finding and the Trigemini.c attack code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1422081#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-02-14 12:41:47 UTC  ``` The TCP stack in the Linux kernel 3.x does not properly implement a SYN cookie protection mechanism for the case of a fast network connection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many TCP SYN packets.  The belief is that the system spends considerable time generating TCP syn cookies and creates a soft lockup in the system, reducing its ability to handle other requests.  This is as the syn cookie generation is serialized per system and not per CPU.  Other CPU's on the system can continue to work correctly.  References:  <https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2017020112> <https://githubengineering.com/syn-flood-mitigation-with-synsanity/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1422081#c2)  Wade Mealing    2017-03-03 04:34:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,6, 7 and MRG-2 kernels.  Red Hat has no plans to fix this issue at this time.  While performance enhancements have been made upstream, Red Hat Product Security believes the report to be invalid and able to be mitigated with synproxy.  This flaw is currently under investigation for validity and Red Hat is asking to revoke the CVE.   ``` |  |

all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

### [CVEProject/cve-schema](/CVEProject/cve-schema)[Support PURL as identifier](/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/173)

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.
