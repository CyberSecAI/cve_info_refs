{
  "cveId": "CVE-2017-5850",
  "description": "The shipped HTTP daemon in OpenBSD (up to the latest version) is prone to a remote Denial of Service (DoS). Requesting a file using a file-range will result in having a httpd process doing a full malloc() of the requested file. It appears the entry is not correctly free()'d.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Improper handling of byte range requests leading to excessive memory allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory exhaustion vulnerability due to incorrect handling of file range requests.",
       "The httpd process does not properly free memory allocated for range requests."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a memory exhaustion DoS by sending crafted HTTP requests with byte range headers, leading to the consumption of all RAM and swap space, causing the system to freeze or crash.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via HTTP requests with a 'Range' header specifying a large file range."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server, and be able to identify a large file served by the http server."
  },
   "additionalNotes": [
    "The advisory also mentions a separate CPU exhaustion vulnerability related to SSL renegotiation, but this is not directly associated with CVE-2017-5850.",
    "The memory exhaustion vulnerability can be triggered using HTTP or HTTPS.",
     "The vulnerability is present in OpenBSD httpd versions up to 6.0.",
    "Patches were issued by OpenBSD to address this vulnerability by disabling range header processing in affected versions.",
    "A reimplementation of byte range handling was done in OpenBSD -current to properly handle the requests."
