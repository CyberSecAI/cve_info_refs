- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A post-authentication vulnerability in the Management Web Interface allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from a folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure (CWE-200)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from a folder, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low-level privileges (i.e., be authenticated) to access the vulnerable web interface.
