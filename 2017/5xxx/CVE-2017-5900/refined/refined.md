Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5900:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the NetComm router model NB16WV-02, specifically when running version NB16WV_R0.09.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Stored XSS vulnerability: The router's web interface does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored and executed when the vulnerable page is accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can inject JavaScript code, which can then be executed by other users of the router's web interface. This can be used to:
    - Steal user sessions.
    - Steal cookies.
    - Perform other malicious actions against router users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the router's web interface. Specifically, the malicious JavaScript payload is injected through the `hdd.htm` page using a specially crafted query parameter.
- The vulnerability is triggered upon page reload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authorized user of the router's web interface to be able to inject the malicious code. This implies the attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the router's web management interface.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (POC) shows the malicious payload being injected using the `S801F0334` parameter in the `hdd.htm` page:
  ```
  http://<router_IP>/hdd.htm?rc=&S801F0334=/dkmvc%3C/script
  %3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28String.fromCharCode%28101,90,101,90%29
  %29%3C/script%3Ed29f
  ```
- This injected script will execute on page reload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to NetComm, and they were planning to release a patch to address it.

This information provides a good overview of the vulnerability, exceeding the basic description typically found in a CVE.
