{
  "CVE-2017-5262": {
    "Root cause": "The SNMP read-only (RO) community string has access to sensitive information by OID reference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configuration",
      "Exposure of sensitive information"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain access to all usernames and passwords, including that of the admin user, as well as other configuration parameter values like the Wi-Fi pre-shared key. This allows full control over the device and the Wi-Fi network it serves.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker on the same network as the cnPilot device can use `snmpget` to query specific OIDs via the RO community string, which can be learned through man-in-the-middle (MitM) and spoofing tactics, as well as brute forcing techniques.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the cnPilot device and have knowledge of (or be able to guess or obtain through network sniffing) the SNMP read-only (RO) community string to exploit this vulnerability."
