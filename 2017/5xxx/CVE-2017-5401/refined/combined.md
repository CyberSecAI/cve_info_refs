[ASM.JS JIT-Spray (Nop-Sled) against 51.0.1 and Nightly](attachment.cgi?id=8831573)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8831573&action=edit)

Dear Mozilla Team,
The mitigations made against [bug 1325200](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325200 "VERIFIED FIXED - lack of executable-code quota allows full bypass of ASLR and DEP") can be circumvented, and hence, ASM.JS
JIT-Spray in combination with heap spray still allows to fully bypass ASLR and
DEP in 32-bit Firefox on Windows. An attacker can directly jump to his controlled
machine code without resorting to memory-disclosures/info-leaks and code reuse,
when exploiting a memory corruption vulnerability.
As stated in [comment #52](/show_bug.cgi?id=1334933#c52 "RESOLVED FIXED - targeted ASM.JS JIT-Spray allows bypassing ASLR and DEP") of [bug 1325200](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325200 "VERIFIED FIXED - lack of executable-code quota allows full bypass of ASLR and DEP"), the attacker first occupies many memory
regions to decrease the entropy of possible 64KB aligned base addresses and then
forces the creation of max. allowed ASM.JS code regions. As shown in the PoC,
his controlled machine code lands at predictable addresses. (Can you reproduce?)
I think the best mitigations are 1) random nop insertion and 2) constant
blinding of four-byte constants:
1) Inserting different-sized nop-like instructions (such as "lea esp, [esp]" and
"nop dword [REG32 + OFFSET]") at random locations into the stream of machine code
instructions decreases the possiblilty to hit a sprayed nop sled. Therefore, each
JIT module should have different random nops. Even if the attacker hits a nop
sled, the instruction stream may "re-synchronize" and his payload becomes
unusable.
2) If four-byte constants are blinded only two(/one)-byte constants can be used to
hide attacker-controlled machine instructions. However, in combination with 1) I
doubt that an attacker can do anything meaningful with
that.
Of course both mitigations may have an unacceptable performance overhead :/.
Still, I hope this helps.
If you need more information, please let me know.
Best,
Rh0
P.S.:
If requested I can provide a PoC with more code execution (.e.g.:
WinExec("cmd")) soon.

Trying to understand the technique being described here: is it the case that the malloc() performed by the 'new ArrayBuffer(0x100000)' is allocating in a predictable pattern that then allows one to fill up the heap with non-executable memory and then free up a few holes at predictable addresses (that subsequently get filled by executable allocations)?

Pwn2Own will use 64-bit builds I hope? 32-bit with its tiny address space is easier to heap-spray/exploit.
I'll be working on these bugs this week, or at least find owners for them.

It's just allocating a ton of memory so code allocations after that are not randomized properly and start to be predictable.
Regarding VirtualAlloc randomization, here are things we need to improve:
(1) Instead of trying once and then doing a non-randomized VirtualAlloc, we could try 5 times or so.
(2) Instead of using only the [64 MiB - 1GiB) range on 32-bit, we should consider using the full address space. I tried this locally and it makes most of our randomized allocations succeed on this PoC. There's a comment in ComputeRandomAllocationAddress saying:
\* x86: V8 comments say that keeping addresses in the [64MiB, 1GiB) range
\* tries to avoid system default DLL mapping space. In the end, we get 13
\* bits of randomness in our selection.
We need input from a Windows expert, but restricting ourselves to 1 GB on Win32 seems very restrictive.
(3) After that, to prevent these heap sprays, maybe we could fail code allocations on Win32 if we're using more than X % (90%?) of our address space. Not sure if there are APIs for this that are useful (we care about 64K chunks, not necessarily free pages).

Given that we're still not proactively shipping Win64 builds, I wouldn't fault them for testing 32-bit builds still.

After some discussion with jandem and dveditz, it seems like a fundamental problem is, as [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1334933#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - targeted ASM.JS JIT-Spray allows bypassing ASLR and DEP") was asking, we're still able to put executable code at predictable addresses due to the completely predictable allocation of \*non\* executable memory. So before jumping all the way to [bug 1333005](/show_bug.cgi?id=1333005 "RESOLVED FIXED"), I think our first step (which should fix this bug) should be to ensure that JIT code is never forced into a predictable address.
One strategy to ensure this is: reserve a contiguous range of MaxCodeBytesPerProcess up front (once per process, when JS engine is first initialized, at a fully random address since the address space is fresh) and then only allocate JIT code out of this range. This would have multiple side benefits: avoiding the need to call RtlAddFunctionTable() at runtime on Windows (which currently has profiler deadlock issues), making platforms more similar, making all x64 jumps/calls "near", etc.

The plan is to have a bitvector with a bit for each page, then when we allocate X pages we look for X consecutive free bits (starting at a random location to get ASLR-like behavior), if we find some we toggle these bits and change the protection of the pages. When we free pages we just change the protection to PROT\_NONE and clear the corresponding bits.Assignee: nobody → jdemooijStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDFlags: needinfo?(dmajor)

From a quick look at the loaded modules on a random VM, I see most libraries in the 6Cxxxxxx to 7xxxxxxx range, even across restarts. It should be fine to increase to 1.5 GiB on pure-Win32 and also include the 2-4 GiB range on WoW64. (We should do a more thorough test across multiple Windows versions and bitness if we go down this route, but that's straightforward.)
Even covering the entire address space probably wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, as long as we increase the attempts in (1).

I looked at those APIs some time ago in [bug 1007534 comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1007534#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Collect about:memory reports for OOM analysis"). You could check ullAvailVirtual from GlobalMemoryStatusEx (since it will be counting at 64K granularity anyway). Is 5-7ms too slow?

Yeah. If we can get away with pre-allocation, there will only be a single large VirtualAlloc at process startup, so we could just try that at 10 different random addresses or so (and the virtual address space will be mostly empty still at that point). I think for now we can keep the ComputeRandomAllocationAddress function as-is and if everything works out we could do a follow-up patch to change it to use the entire address space on 32-bit.

Thanks. Hopefully we don't need this, if pre-allocating works :)

Attached patch

[Patch](attachment.cgi?id=8832859&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8832859&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1334933&attachment=8832859)

This patch works nicely. We reserve a MaxCodeBytesPerProcess region on startup, then we commit/decommit random pages from that based on a bitset.
I added some logging on Mac and I tested this with VMMap on Win32 + Win64 and everything looks reasonable: pages are allocated randomly and we decommit them correctly.
The patch is pretty large because it moves some code around (I removed ExecutableAllocator{Win,Posix}.cpp and merged them with the new ProcessExecutableMemory.cpp file to make it easier to change this code. Sorry about that.
I also cleaned up some ExecutableAllocator code and interfaces. I removed the W^X #define as we're probably not going to turn that off anytime soon.
Overall this patch is a nice refactoring/cleanup I think, and if this sticks there will be more code to remove: the Win64 profiler lock, jump tables on x64, etc.

I just noticed this one (and the places where it's used) should use uint32\_t or size\_t instead of WordType (it doesn't matter as it's the same type but still).

I'm pretty sure there are some second-tier platforms for which this will fail. I also think it's possible to configure a Windows system to use larger pages so surely there are a handful of users that do this. Probably we should use gc::SystemPageSize().

Good points. I updated the patch to use ExecutableCodePageSize (= 64K) chunk sizes and I changed ExecutableAllocator to use that value as well.
I didn't do this initially because of asm.js/wasm allocations that can be much smaller than 64K, but the plan is to move them to ExecutableAllocator soon so this will no longer be an issue then.

It adds a new custom allocator for JIT pages, so there's definitely some risk. If it's stable on Nightly (with regular JS fuzzing) for a few days I don't expect serious problems though.

erahm, njn: we will reserve (per process) a region of memory that's 144 MB on 32-bit platforms (we could shrink this a bit if really needed) and 640 MB on 64-bit platforms. JIT code allocations will then use \*only\* pages in that part of the address space.
This fixes the security issue here where a heap spray is used to trick Windows into using predictable addresses for JIT code. It could prevent certain UAF bugs as well (because this memory is never available for anything else). It will also have a number of other benefits: it should avoid the profiler deadlocks on Win64 because we only call RtlAddFunctionTable at startup, we will be able to use near jumps on x64, and it makes us behave more consistently across platforms.

640 MB on 64-bit is fine, address space is plentiful there.
144 MB on 32-bit is less fine. Many users only have 2 GiB of address space, that's 7% of it, and virtual OOMs are common. Please reduce the size if you can.

Do we have a sense of how much total JIT code 32-bit users have when they OOM? If they frequently approach 144MB anyway, then this isn't really worse, just moving the allocation up-front. But if the actual number is lower, then yeah, that 144MB reservation could be taking away from other things.

njn: while virtual OOMs are certainly a problem on 32-bit, I had assumed that the problem here was fragmentation which shrinking the space by 7% with 1 big allocation wouldn't really hurt. Is that the case or do we also see virtual OOMs where the entire 2gb is allocated?
Anyhow, I expect we could reduce it somewhat, though, without hurting.

A single big 144 MiB allocation is certainly better than a lot of smaller ones that add up to 144 MiB. But. Typically, virtual OOMs start becoming a risk once the amount of total virtual memory available drops to 200 MiB or so. Any reduction just leaves less headroom.

Do we know how many of our users are still using Firefox 32-bit \*on 32-bit Windows\*, especially after we drop XP/Vista support? I know this will have to be backported to releases that support XP..
> Please reduce the size if you can.
We can try to reduce it from 144 to 128 MB or so, maybe more if we notice a spike in OOM crashes. Unfortunately capping our JIT code memory also has risks, it behaves similar to an OOM. We did get topcrashes on beta a few weeks ago from users hitting this. We now stop JIT compilation if we approach Limit - 16MB, that helped so I feel better about reducing this number, but it's still not great.
e10s-multi will also help a lot, unfortunately that will arrive just a few releases too late for most users :/

Yes, we do! The Firefox Hardware Report September has statistics on the Firefox and the OS architecture.
See <https://metrics.mozilla.com/firefox-hardware-report/#goto-os-and-architecture>
In terms of release timing (e.g., in connection with e10s-multi) we need to remember pwn2own:

According to the "OS by architecture" graph there, 32-bit declined from 34.20% to 32.27% between April and September last year. Let's say ~30% now. That's still quite a lot of users unfortunately (about half of them is likely XP/Vista, but still).

Yeah, though pwn2own will use 64-bit Firefox so the bug reported here is not an issue there (or at least way more difficult/time-consuming). We should still get this in Firefox 52 though.

This patch reduces the limit from 144 to 128 MiB on 32-bit.
The patch also tweaks the preserve-code mechanism a bit to discard code more eagerly if we are approaching this limit.

[Part 3 - Randomize on non-Windows too](attachment.cgi?id=8833679&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1334933&attachment=8833679)

On non-Windows platforms we have always used mmap without randomization. Here's a patch to generate a random address and pass that as hint to mmap.
I tested this on OS X and on x64 mmap was always able to use the addresses we generate with this patch (because huge address space). On 32-bit we succeed most of the time. It doesn't really matter: if the address is not available the OS will pick a different one.
V8 has somewhat similar code for this FWIW.

[Part 4 - Fix randomization on Linux 32-bit](attachment.cgi?id=8833871&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1334933&attachment=8833871)

We're seeing some new Linux32 jit-test intermittents, a regression from part 3 I think.
We pass a random address to mmap as hint, but we actually need to be more careful on Linux to not use memory that we later need for stack pages. This patch changes ComputeRandomAllocationAddress on posix to use range [512MiB, 2.5GiB) on 32-bit.
This matches the V8 code and I can no longer reproduce the crashes locally (I got 1 crash in ~2000 runs of a particular jit-test, with this patch I got no failures after 100,000 runs).
Posting this here as we'll need to uplift it with the other ones.

Interestingly, it looks like there was a noticeable improvement in MEMORY\_VSIZE\_MAX\_CONTIGUOUS on the Nightly that this landed in: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.telemetry-alerts/CxxcrxL5v7c>
Specifically, the patch from [comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1334933#c31 "RESOLVED FIXED - targeted ASM.JS JIT-Spray allows bypassing ASLR and DEP"). Maybe it cleaned up some fragmentation issues we were having?

Interesting. It makes sense, I think: we used to allocate JIT code in 64K pools (most of the time) and we used a random allocation address for \*all of these\* allocations, see ComputeRandomAllocationAddress:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/afcf40f3eafd895611a839017730debb58a342a6/js/src/jit/ProcessExecutableMemory.cpp#40-66,262>
Due to this randomization, you don't need many allocations to fragment the address space pretty quickly.
The patch there reserve a single 128 MB region per process on 32-bit, which probably uses more virtual address space but it's contiguous so it no longer places stuff at random locations.

Hopefully that's the case. I find the graph showing the telemetry change very hard to interpret.

Prior to the change, 46% of the values were at the max value or larger (which looks like it is about 16MB). After the change, 53% are.

[complete PoC: ASM.JS JIT-Spray (WinExec\_cmd) against 51.0.1](attachment.cgi?id=8842455)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8842455&action=edit)

For the sake of completeness here is a complete Proof of Concept against [bug 1334933](/show_bug.cgi?id=1334933 "RESOLVED FIXED - targeted ASM.JS JIT-Spray allows bypassing ASLR and DEP") which circumvents the fix introduced in [bug 1325200](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325200 "VERIFIED FIXED - lack of executable-code quota allows full bypass of ASLR and DEP"). It may be used to execute arbitrary code (i.e.: WinExec('cmd.exe')), thereby bypassing ASLR and DEP without info-leaks and code-reuse, only needing control of EIP.
Best,
Rh0

Fwiw (and as discussed with :jandem on IRC), this broke the build of TB 45.8.0 on OpenBSD where this triggers the W^X protection when precompiling startup cache - before that, we were using a patch from #1215479 to enforce nonWritableJitCode (cf <http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/mail/mozilla-thunderbird/patches/Attic/patch-mozilla_js_src_jit_ExecutableAllocator_cpp?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup>):
xpcshell(53926): mmap W^X violation
Testing a build with the tor-browser patch from <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/21514> - should fix the issue, i'm going to update TB to 52.0 soon anyway.

The patch from tor-browser repo allows me to produce a working TB 45.8.0 install on OpenBSD, not hitting the W^X mmap protection anymore.

Removing the qe+ flag due to the fact that the qe request is a little old and also due to the fact that the issue would pose a technical challenge to reproduce and verify anyways.

Please re-add the qe+ flag if you think that effort should still be directed into verifying this fix by QA and please provide additional breakdown details regarding how to reproduce and verify the fix.

This bug was filed from the Socorro interface and is
report [bp-57766b22-bc36-42be-b8b0-e60982170105](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/57766b22-bc36-42be-b8b0-e60982170105).
=============================================================
This is a blank Firefox profile I created to create a clean report of this bug. Steps to reproduce (happens every time):
1. Install Zotero for Firefox 4.0.29.16 from <https://www.zotero.org/download/>
2. Install YesScript 2.2 from addons.mozilla.org
3. Restart Firefox
4. Go to www.google.com
5. Click the YesScript blacklist button
6. Press F5 to refresh page
7. Firefox crashes.
Platform: Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit. Firefox 50.1.0.
Cross-reported to both YesScript and Zotero:
\* <https://github.com/JasonBarnabe/yesscript/issues/13>
\* <https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/63733/854545803-firefox-crashes-when-addons-yesscript-and-zotero-are-both-installed>
Not sure I would classify this as critical severity, but that is what the reporting tool defaulted to.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
I have tested this issue on latest Firefox release v50.1.0 and latest Firefox Beta (v51.0b12) and the issue is reproducible.
Also, I have tried to reproduce the issue on latest Nightly (Build ID: 20170109030209) and latest Dev Edition and couldn't reproduce it. I did a find fix range with mozregression and reached the following pushlog: <https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/pushloghtml?fromchange=10daeea4d322f4d396538ebac11b4bfdd5f5a798&tochange=578dfd6dba5e20d87b7642acef8d093d8be8e268>
It seems the fix was made in [bug 1293305](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293305 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable non-standard for-each on nightly-only"). The fix will probably reach to Firefox release version in v52.Status: UNCONFIRMED → RESOLVEDClosed: 8 years agoResolution: --- → WORKSFORME

I've tested with e10s ON and OFF. On Nightly versions e10s remains ON even if the add-ons are installed. On the release version e10s is disabled when installing add-ons.
The issue is reproducible on Nightly with e10s OFF. When testing try both scenarios, e10s ON and e10s OFF.

It's all fine in 52.0.a2. No crashes and both addons work after preliminary testing. According to Add-on Compatibility Reporter, "multiprocess is enabled". Thanks for looking into this bug! I'm looking forward to when 52 gets released as stable.Flags: needinfo?(devel)

I can still reproduce this crash in Beta 52 and Aurora 53. You don't need to install the YesScript extension. You can just flip the "javascript.enabled" pref to false, install the "Zotero for Firefox" extension, then load any web page.
@ Nick, could this crash be a regression from your CC [bug 1261106](/show_bug.cgi?id=1261106 "NEW - XHR with unknown edge in CC graph keeps its reflector alive past ~CycleCollectedJSRuntime, which transitively leaks js::ScriptSource objects")?
I bisected this crash to the following regression range. Your commit looks suspicious because it deals with JS memory management.

Every patch that landed in that bug was backed out before getting into a nightly, so I am pretty sure it isn't that bug's patches.
A bit of an aside, but I concluded that shutdown interaction between the CC and GC is so borked and complicated that the investment required to fix it isn't worth the pay off :-/Flags: needinfo?(nfitzgerald)

Boris, could this crash be a regression from your fix for "Provide better error messages when CallSetup fails" [bug 1269400](/show_bug.cgi?id=1269400 "RESOLVED FIXED - NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED thrown by Web IDL callbacks from unloaded documents is not very informative")? It is in the regression range and touches DOM bindings code, which is in the neighborhood of this ClearDOMExceptionInfo() crash.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Hmm. I dug into this a bit in [bug 1313340](/show_bug.cgi?id=1313340 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Crashes with mozilla::ErrorResult::ClearDOMExceptionInfo since Firefox 49") (of which this seems to be a duplicate).
But yes, this could be related to [bug 1269400](/show_bug.cgi?id=1269400 "RESOLVED FIXED - NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED thrown by Web IDL callbacks from unloaded documents is not very informative"), especially given the steps to reproduce from [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1328861#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash in arena_dalloc | mozilla::binding_danger::TErrorResult<T>::ClearDOMExceptionInfo"), which would in fact trigger the modified codepath (due to disabling script).
Having steps to reproduce is huge. Let me spin up a debug beta build and take a look!

Yes, this is totally a regression from [bug 1269400](/show_bug.cgi?id=1269400 "RESOLVED FIXED - NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED thrown by Web IDL callbacks from unloaded documents is not very informative"). A debug build makes it pretty obvious what happens. The sequence of events is as follows:
1) document.evaluate is called. How is it called if script is disabled, you might ask? Extensions, of course. I did not debug the details, past noting that this call is coming from a sandbox with some web page principal attached; we call into that sandbox via Xrays. Presumably whatever codepath evals in sandbox doesn't check for script-enabled? In any case, this function takes an XPathNSResolver? argument, which is a WebIDL callback.
2) We call XPathEvaluator::Evaluate and thence XPathEvaluator::CreateExpression. We're passing along that callback argument.
3) We stash the callback in an XPathEvaluatorParseContext and call CreateExpression.
4) While parsing the thing we were passed, we call the callback to do that namespace-resolving thing it's supposed to do.
5) The callback function comes from that same sandbox, as far as I can tell. We deny the call to it, because we decide that the script is disabled for this sandbox (via xpc::Scriptability::Get(realCallback).Allowed()). This seems weird; I filed [bug 1338313](/show_bug.cgi?id=1338313 "REOPENED - Sort out how content-principal sandboxes should behave when script is disabled") on that.
6) We hit the code added in [bug 1269400](/show_bug.cgi?id=1269400 "RESOLVED FIXED - NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED thrown by Web IDL callbacks from unloaded documents is not very informative") and ThrowDOMException() on the ErrorResult.
7) We unwind to XPathEvaluatorParseContext::resolveNamespacePrefix which has code like this:
217 ErrorResult rv;
218 mResolver->LookupNamespaceURI(prefix, ns, rv);
219 if (rv.Failed()) {
220 return rv.StealNSResult();
Note that in this case it returns NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_DOMEXCEPTION. This is all sort of ok so far, but then...
8) We keep unwinding to XPathEvaluator::CreateExpression where we do this:
150 aRv = txExprParser::createExpr(PromiseFlatString(aExpression), aContext,
151 getter\_Transfers(expression));
152 if (aRv.Failed()) {
153 if (!aRv.ErrorCodeIs(NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_NAMESPACE\_ERR)) {
154 aRv.SuppressException();
155 aRv.Throw(NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INVALID\_EXPRESSION\_ERR);
156 }
where aRv is an ErrorResult. Keep in mind that NS\_ERROR\_DOMEXCEPTION is what got returned. This, of course, asserts in TErrorResult::AssignErrorCode from that assignment to aRv:
MOZ\_ASSERT(aRv != NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_DOMEXCEPTION, "Use ThrowDOMException()");
but then goes ahead and sets mResult = aRv. Then aRv.Failed() tests true, aRv.ErrorCodeIs(NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_NAMESPACE\_ERR) tests false, so we call aRv.SuppressException(). This tries to do cleanup based on mResult being NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_DOMEXCEPTION, which involves "delete mDOMExceptionInfo;"... but mDOMExceptionInfo is pointing to random memory (because we don't actually have anything in our union; if we got this far in a debug build without failing the earlier asserts we'd fail the mUnionState assert in TErrorResultClearDOMExceptionInfo). Typically we crash as a result.
OK, so there are several possible fixes:
1) Make TErrorResult::AssignErrorCode safer and have it sanitize any of the "disallowed" values (specifically NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR, NS\_ERROR\_RANGE\_ERR, NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_JS\_EXCEPTION, and NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_DOMEXCEPTION) to some innocuous nsresult value. This is probably the generally safest fix, since it makes sure we can't end up in a situation where we have on of those as mResult.
2) Make TErrorResult::StealNSResult sanitize those "disallowed" values.
Option 2 is arguably a bit faster. Option 1 is safer. Ccing some DOM folks who may have opinions.
Anyway, I just went and looked at where we use those 4 error codes. NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_JS\_EXCEPTION and NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_DOMEXCEPTION are only used inside ErrorResult.
NS\_ERROR\_RANGE\_ERR is used in nsSVGTransform::SetSkewX/Y. Luckily, no one looks at the return values.
NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR is used all sorts of places. A bunch of them return directly via xpconnect, but a few...
\* nsGlobalWindow::CreateImageBitmap has some "we don't handle that" codepaths that throw it. We clearly didn't add tests for those codepaths. And indeed, window.createImageBitmap(document.createElement("canvas"), 0, 0, "RGBA32", []) will corrupt memory for you very nicely. This was added in [bug 1141979](/show_bug.cgi?id=1141979 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FoxEye] Extend ImageBitmap with interfaces to access its underlying image data"). Similar for WorkerGlobalScope::CreateImageBitmap, though it would need something more like createImageBitmap(new Blob(['']), 0, 0, 'RGBA32', []). I filed [bug 1338319](/show_bug.cgi?id=1338319 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Add tests for the various codepaths added in bug 1141979") on this.
\* Various serviceworker stuff, which I can't trace reliably in a short period of time. At least the pieces that reject promises with NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR are safe, because that doesn't go through an ErrorResult.
\* AudioEventTimeline. I can't figure out whether there's a way to sneak non-finite floats into there, but if there is, it's bad.
\* DataTransfer::SetDataAtInternal when aFormat is "application/x-moz-custom-clipdata". Evaluating new DataTransfer("copy", false).setData("application/x-moz-custom-clipdata", "") in the browser console does the memory corruption thing too. I'm sure a web page could do that from a relevant event handler. Filed bug
Alright, so given all that I think I'm going to go with option 1. And we should consider using less-likely-to-be-reached-for nsresult names here, I guess... :(
I have not filed a bug on the DataTransfer thing yet.Group: dom-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → DOMProduct: Firefox → Core

For what it's worth, 1141979 also dates back to 49. The DataTransfer code dates back to [bug 860857](/show_bug.cgi?id=860857 "RESOLVED FIXED - Support custom mimetypes via clipboardData for clipboard events"), which is Firefox 48. So I \_think\_ esr45 is unaffected by all this.
The createImageBitmap crash is reproducible just fine with a current-ish tip build.
The "zotero + disabled script" thing is not, probably because on tip various parts of the zotero add-on are broken due to "for each" support being removed on nightly only. That happened in [bug 1293305](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293305 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable non-standard for-each on nightly-only"). I did just try re-enabling "for each" in my tip opt build, and then it reproduces the "zotero + disabled script" crash just fine.

Er, maybe not. I was running the wrong build there. But anyway, I don't think anything happened to the underlying issue in the meantime. Maybe we're getting lucky and our random pointer happens to be null...

Upon further thought, I'm going to do both options 1 and 2. Option 1 is needed for code that sort of reasonably does StealNSResult() and then throws it on another ErrorResult to not fail with fatal asserts when interesting things were thrown on the source ErrorResult. Option 2 is needed to deal with the various places that throw our internal nsresults. :(

I think we should check this in and backport it, then maybe do a followup where we use some more-clearly-private nsresult values and remove the bits in AssignErrorCode. Maybe.

Be a little less trusting about our error codes in ErrorResult
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? It's hard to say. Once I figured out the basic problem, it took just a few minutes of code searching to find the bugs in createImageBitmap and DataTransfer. Unfortunately, I can't think of a way to write this patch that doesn't make it clear that \_something\_ is up with ErrorResult mResult values. :(
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? In theory, all of them, but in practice I think all the problem callsites were added in 48 or later. So anything newer than that.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? There are multiple separate flaws, introduced in [bug 1269400](/show_bug.cgi?id=1269400 "RESOLVED FIXED - NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED thrown by Web IDL callbacks from unloaded documents is not very informative"), [bug 1141979](/show_bug.cgi?id=1141979 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FoxEye] Extend ImageBitmap with interfaces to access its underlying image data"), [bug 860857](/show_bug.cgi?id=860857 "RESOLVED FIXED - Support custom mimetypes via clipboardData for clipboard events").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? This applies cleanly to 52 and tip and anything in between.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? I think this is a pretty safe patch.

[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: Crashes, crashes everywhere. Also, I think this is sec:crit.
User impact if declined: Crashes. And security bugs.
Fix Landed on Version: Will be 54.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low risk, in my opinion.
The alternatives all seem riskier, including doing nothing.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [bug 1269400](/show_bug.cgi?id=1269400 "RESOLVED FIXED - NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED thrown by Web IDL callbacks from unloaded documents is not very informative"), [bug 1141979](/show_bug.cgi?id=1141979 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FoxEye] Extend ImageBitmap with interfaces to access its underlying image data"), [bug 860857](/show_bug.cgi?id=860857 "RESOLVED FIXED - Support custom mimetypes via clipboardData for clipboard events")
[User impact if declined]: Crashes, security bugs. Repetitive template
syndrome.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: No, which is the problem; we have
assertions for all this stuff already. More precisely, we have general
coverage of ErrorResult, obviously, but not for the three codepaths that we
have found so far that can cause issues.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Not yet.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Probably a good idea.
See [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1328861#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash in arena_dalloc | mozilla::binding_danger::TErrorResult<T>::ClearDOMExceptionInfo") for steps.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None.
[Is the change risky?]: In my opinion, no.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: It just changes which exact exceptions we
end up throwing in some cases. And the cases it changes would likely lead
to a crash otherwise.
[String changes made/needed]: None.

Urgh, error reporting is really fragile. Throwing NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR should just work.

We really must rename these magical error codes to something else. Just looking at the ErrorResult API nothing hints that some NS\_ERROR\_ shouldn't be used
(well, unless one reads all the assertions).
Could we for now make NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR to call ThrowTypeError() and NS\_ERROR\_RANGE\_ERR ThrowRangeError() ? But perhaps that isn't needed if we rename the error codes and fix callers and keep this patch for branches.
r+ for branches, but this is very broken setup, so we must change error code names (or fix the API in some other way). NS\_ERROR\_DANGER\_BINDING\_LAYER\_INTERNAL\_TYPE\_ERR or some such might be scary enough. Same for the other errors.

> Throwing NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR should just work.
Work and do what? NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR is a standin for "synthesize a TypeError", and that only works with ErrorResult. Throwing it in general is not very meaningful.
Again, we can just move ErrorResult to a different error code here, but then I would argue we should remove NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR because it's just an attractive nuisance that doesn't do what people want.
> Hmm, I guess this is fine, though it is sad to lose information.
I agree. The reason we need this part is because I want to keep the asserts in AssignErrorCode and doing aRv = otherRv.StealNSResult() (indirectly) should really not trigger them. I'm open to better ideas. I mean, long-term the answer is to disallow throwing an nsresult on an ErrorResult or something, but that's pretty long-term.
> We really must rename these magical error codes to something else
Yes. I will do that in a followup. I'd like to land a single patch here on trunk and branches first to fix the immediate issue.
> Could we for now make NS\_ERROR\_TYPE\_ERR to call ThrowTypeError() and NS\_ERROR\_RANGE\_ERR ThrowRangeError() ?
We could, I guess, with some sort of default message. But I'd rather not do that, honestly; people should be doing things the right way instead.

                 CVE-2017-5410

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code or information leaks.

With this update, the Icedove packages are de-branded back to the official
Mozilla branding. With the removing of the Debian branding the packages
are also renamed back to the official names used by Mozilla.

The Thunderbird package is using a different default profile folder,
the default profile folder is now '$(HOME)/.thunderbird'.
The users profile folder, that was used in Icedove, will get migrated
to the new profile folder on the first start, that can take a little bit
more time.

Please read README.Debian for getting more information about the
changes.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.8.0-3~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

#### [#CVE-2017-5425: Overly permissive Gecko Media Plugin sandbox regular expression access](#CVE-2017-5425)

Reporter
Haik Aftandilian
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Gecko Media Plugin sandbox allows access to local files that match specific regular expressions. On OS OX, this matching allows access to some data in subdirectories of `/private/var` that could expose personal or temporary data. This has been updated to not allow access to `/private/var` and its subdirectories.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-5426: Gecko Media Plugin sandbox is not started if seccomp-bpf filter is running](#CVE-2017-5426)

Reporter
Jed Davis
Impact
moderate
##### Description

On Linux, if the secure computing mode BPF (seccomp-bpf) filter is running when the Gecko Media Plugin sandbox is started, the sandbox fails to be applied and items that would run within the sandbox are run protected only by the running filter which is typically weak compared to the sandbox.
*Note: this issue only affects Linux. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-5427: Non-existent chrome.manifest file loaded during startup](#CVE-2017-5427)

Reporter
Mike Kaply
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A non-existent chrome.manifest file will attempt to be loaded during startup from the primary installation directory. If a malicious user with local access puts chrome.manifest and other referenced files in this directory, they will be loaded and activated during startup. This could result in malicious software being added without consent or modification of referenced installed files.

critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Christian Holler, Honza Bambas, Jon Coppeard, Randell Jesup, André Bargull, Kan-Ru Chen, and Nathan Froyd reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 45.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, ASLR
bypass, information disclosure or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.8.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.8.0esr-1 of firefox-esr and version 52.0-1 of firefox.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Christian Holler, Honza Bambas, Jon Coppeard, Randell Jesup, André Bargull, Kan-Ru Chen, and Nathan Froyd reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 51 and Firefox ESR 45.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
