The provided content describes two zero-day vulnerabilities in IP cameras. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication bypass and information disclosure:** The first vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and request any file in the web server folder. This enables them to access sensitive information, such as the camera's password.
*   **Web server command injection:** The second vulnerability allows the injection of commands through the web server. Because the web server runs as root, these commands also execute with root privileges.
*  **Password Complexity flaw:** Due to the use of an 'or' operand instead of an 'and', passwords can only consist of all numbers, all lowercase characters or all uppercase characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication bypass:** The ability to bypass authentication mechanisms.
*   **Information disclosure:** The ability to access sensitive files, such as the password file.
*   **Command injection:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands on the system via the web server.
*   **Insecure password implementation:** Flaw in the password complexity implementation.
*   **Vulnerable/outdated software:** The cameras use very old and vulnerable software, including web server software from around 2002.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full control of the camera:** Attackers can gain complete control of the camera, regardless of the user's password.
*   **Remote code execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the camera due to the root privileges associated with web server commands.
*   **Botnet creation:** By exploiting these vulnerabilities on multiple devices, attackers can build a botnet.
*   **Internal network access:** The camera can be used as a pivot point to access the internal network it's connected to.
*   **Surveillance manipulation:** Attackers can move the camera, view its feed, or make it send different images.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web server:** Exploitation is performed through the camera's web server interface.
*   **Internet access:** The cameras are accessible over the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable camera.
*   **Basic web request knowledge:** Exploitation can be done via simple web requests.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerabilities**: Understanding how to exploit the authentication bypass and command injection flaws.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities are found in multiple camera models from various manufacturers, primarily those sold as white-box devices.
*   The same vulnerable software is used across different hardware models.
*   The researchers notified some vendors but did not receive responses.
*   The cameras are typically not designed to receive updates, so patching is not feasible.
*   The default password for many cameras is '888888'.
*   A tool was developed by Cybereason to check if a camera is vulnerable (link provided in the article).
*   The article lists specific serial number prefixes and characteristics to help users identify vulnerable cameras.
*   The web interface will show the following: “VIP Camera” or a login page with the format observed in the article

The article provides detailed information about the vulnerabilities, their impact, and ways to check if a camera is affected. It emphasizes the lack of security in IoT devices and the potential for large-scale botnet attacks.
