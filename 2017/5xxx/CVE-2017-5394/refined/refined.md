Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of factors related to JavaScript events, fullscreen mode, and tab switching on Firefox for Android. Specifically, a series of JavaScript events combined with fullscreen mode can cause the location bar of a loaded page to be displayed over the content of another tab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Location Bar Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof the location bar. The browser UI displays the URL of one page, while the content of a different page is actually displayed, potentially misleading the user.
*   **Insecure Tab Switching:** The vulnerability leverages a combination of actions across multiple tabs. This indicates a weakness in how Firefox handles tab switching and rendering updates, particularly when fullscreen mode is active.
*   **Abuse of JavaScript Events:** Malicious use of JavaScript events, like timers and alerts, allows for a manipulated tab switch after another tab has entered fullscreen. This allows for the spoofing to happen.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Deception:** The most direct impact is the ability to deceive users by presenting a fake URL while displaying different content. This can trick users into providing credentials or personal information on what they believe to be a trusted site when they are on a malicious site.
*   **Clickjacking/CSRF Attacks:** The spoofed location bar, combined with the displayed content of another site, could be used for clickjacking and cross-site request forgery attacks. An attacker could overlay hidden UI elements over a trusted site's interface, tricking users into performing actions on the trusted site unknowingly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** The primary attack vector is a malicious web page that uses JavaScript to perform the necessary actions to trigger the spoofing.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on a user loading the malicious page and performing specific actions (e.g., clicking on a link), however, a skilled attacker might be able to reduce the required interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious page that contains the exploit code.
*   **Basic JavaScript Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to write JavaScript code to trigger the sequence of events required for the exploit.
*   **Targeted User:** The attacker needs to lure a user to the malicious page.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability specifically affects Firefox for Android and not other operating systems
*   The vulnerability can occur across multiple Firefox versions.
