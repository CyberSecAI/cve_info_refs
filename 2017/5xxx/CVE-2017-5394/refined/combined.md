User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_11\_6) AppleWebKit/602.1.50 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0 Safari/602.1.50
Steps to reproduce:
1) Install both "attacker" and "victim" extensions in the attachment to Firefox
2. Open the browser\_action of "victim" and click a link "Click to Reproduce" in the page
Actual results:
You can see a message "victim is pwned by attacker" in the page and an alert is shown with the content of victim extension's localStorage, i.e., SECRET
This means that the the attacker's extensions can control other extension's pages with data: scheme.
The cause of this issue is below.
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/modules/addons/MatchPattern.jsm#21>
Here the data: scheme is whitelisted but data: documents in Firefox inherits opener's context.
Expected results:
The data: scheme pages in another extension should be controlled by other extensions.

Kris, is this as simple as removing "data" from the whitelist, or is this more complicated? Maybe if add-ons like using data: for their initial URIs or something, we just need to make sure that any followup navigations include DISABLE\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL or whatever the flag is?Group: firefox-core-security → toolkit-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → WebExtensions: GeneralFlags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)Product: Firefox → Toolkit

Potential for privilege escalation. Mitigated by the fact that extension permissions aren't currently exposed to users, and legacy extensions aren't sandboxed at all. Can't be used to gain chrome privileges since content scripts are never allowed to inherit the system principal.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

That made sense to me, so I did that, but I'm not the happiest with the outcome.
This does in fact fix the security issue at hand, but the bigger dev story about specifying a "data:" scheme in the match pattern makes little sense after this fix.
We could either deprecate the use case, or at least document the issue (later, obviously). Not sure if there would be any actual impact on compatibility. Maybe Andy could check what percentage of Chrome extensions actually tries to match against data: URIs (explicitly), for what purpose, and if this would break any?

Yeah. So, I can see two... three alternatives:
1) Remove support for data: URL match patterns, and just match them based on the principal URL.
2) Keep supporting match patterns, but check that the principal URL either matches another match pattern or matches a host permission.
3) Treat data: URLs the same way we treat about:blank and about:srcdoc, and either add matchDataURLs or reuse matchAboutBlank to match them.

This looks pretty good to me, but I'm leaving it r? pending a decision on how we should handle the match patterns.

I wonder if we should just check `Services.netUtils.URIChainHasFlags(uri, URI\_INHERITS\_SECURITY\_CONTEXT)`? I guess it shouldn't make a difference, given that we already restrict match patterns, though...

No, this only means I didn't run those tests after the last "just some code cleanup", I'm sorry! :(
browser\_ext\_tabs\_executeScript.js#205 fails with that.

I was considering that, but no other scheme that we allow inherits. Using a check against "data" probably results in more explicit, readable code. Although, this being a security fix, maybe that's not desirable? ;)

This is basically my current fix (host permissions are already used for tabs.executeScript).
Options 1) and 3) need to be public by nature, and can be done as a follow-up after this lands to fix the immediate threat. So my current thinking is to go with this, and decide on further actions outside the time pressure of this bug.

In case it's relevant: note that data: is treated differently by chrome than by us - it can inherit a principal in Firefox, and doesn't in Chrome, see <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/w0IgmymXDds/4-EvoXPvAAAJ> (which is about us aligning with Chrome, which is... difficult).

No other mentions in content\_scripts declarations? That's almost unbelievable.

From smaug's last email in that thread, it looks like this is actually happening.
Once that is done, alternatives 1) and 3) become unnecessary, and we might want to revert to matching against the data: URI (and not principal) for compat reasons.
Which brings the question whether we should do anything here, apart from fixing the (temporary) security issue until data: URIs get the unique opaque origins?

Sorry to be such a pain about this. Given the discussion so far, I'd be happy with just the two changes below. They should also allow the code to correctly match non-inherited data: URI origins, when they're implemented, without any changes.

Let's go with the URI\_INHERITS\_SECURITY\_CONTEXT flag check for now, just for the sake of future proofing, and add a comment that it currently applies only to data: URIs. I agree that this version is more readable, but it seems like this behavior is going to change, and we might wind up overlooking other similar cases in the future.

Given the way we're currently handling this, and how similar it is to the use case and handling of about:srcdoc, I think maybe we should only do this if match\_about\_blank is set, and reject the match otherwise.

mixedpuppy is currently working on allowing extensions to match their own moz-extension: URLs. I'm not actually sure what the expected behavior will be for executeScript with actual extension pages at that point... so this might break. But we'll deal with that when we come to it.
The fix would probably involve just loading two extensions rather than one.

Based on what I know about security bugs, it wasn't really that painful. ;)
Anyway, your arguments make sense, even if I don't fully agree with the match\_about\_blank part.

This loses the ability to fail with the matched document's URI in the log (which was useful to me during debugging), so I kept the other approach.

It's a common rule in C and C++, too, and also in Toolkit code. All arguments
are aligned with the first argument, and the first argument either goes
immediately after the opening paren, or on its own line at the next indent
level.

bug-1319070-fix-v3.patch
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not too easily. Understanding the issue in this bug could be considered easy (for a security researcher). Realizing that this could also apply to another extension's page is a first non-obvious leap IMO. Finally, constructing an exploit extension that navigates a "victim" extension's page to a data: URI is probably fairly hard (I'm not aware of a way to do that).
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included
> in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The tests are in a separate patch. The use of URI\_INHERITS\_SECURITY\_CONTEXT constant, and the comment above make it somewhat obvious this a security-related patch, especially if it lands linked to a protected bug. But nothing in the patch points to this applying for extension pages, the first necessary leap explained above.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
The original POC works on aurora. It doesn't work on beta and release, but that is related to the use of popup. Opening victim extension's page in a tab still allows the attacker extension to attach the content script after navigating to a data:URI. The `localStorage.get()` method call throws "Component is not available" for some reason, but that is only one venue of attack, there are likely others available to attacker that can attach a content script.
> If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
No bug. This is an architectural mismatch between Chrome's extension API and our inheriting principals for data: URIs.
> Do you have backports for the affected branches?
No.
> If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Slightly different because the code is related to `match\_about\_blank` which was implemented in the last cycle (current aurora). But not risky as the actual fix is fairly simple and easy to understand/test.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
It is unlikely this will cause a lot of regressions. Per Andy's comment above, explicitly matching against data: URIs is rare, and using <all\_urls> will continue to work if extensions have the right to match the owner document.
Not a single existing web extensions test failed as a result of this fix.

Looking again into this, I disagree with myself here. I was thinking of the impact of my original proposed patch. With the final patch, which refuses the match without match\_about\_blank, this is much more likely to break existing extensions.
And this is especially true for backports to earlier branches where match\_about\_blank was not implemented, and extensions couldn't even include it because schema validation would throw.
Kris, in light of this, do you agree with backports ignoring match\_about\_blank, and always matching against the principal (basically my original patch)? I know it's not your preferred fix, but it would only be "temporary", and would give us time to document the new behavior in Nightly and let developers "fix" extensions while this rides the trains?Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Andy, can you please check again how many extensions is this likely to affect?
The number of Chrome extensions that specify <all\_urls> in `content\_scripts`, and how many of those also specify match\_about\_blank?Flags: needinfo?(amckay)

This is the patch I propose for beta and earlier branches.
Built and passing all tests on beta, but:
- Couldn't build on ESR45 for some reason,
- Successfully built on the release branch, but our mochitests don't run for for another obscure reason. Manually confirmed the security fix.
Including match\_about\_blank in those versions would require changes in quite a few more places: tabs.executeScript, schema... To minimize risk from those, I suggest we go with this.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

bug-1319070-fix-aurora.patch
This is a trivial port of the original patch that got r+ and sec-approval+ above.
Approval Request Comment
> [Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
No bug. Web extensions content scripts have a security issue.
> [User impact if declined]:
Potential privilege escalation between extensions.
> [Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Existing functionality around this code has good test coverage. I wrote new tests for this issue, though they are not landing yet because security bug.
> [Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Yes, I built and manually verified on both nightly and aurora.
> [Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Unsure what is the protocol for security bugs. I'm guessing no.
If I'm wrong, STR are in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319070#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Web Extension's data: scheme pages can be controlled by other extensions").
> [List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
None
> [Is the change risky?]:
Somewhat
> [Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
Overall, not too risky as impact is limited to Web extensions. But the change might break some existing extensions. This is unavoidable, and we have steps for developers to mitigate (not yet public due to security bug).

I don't this is very likely to cause serious issues in practice.

From my understanding of the ESR\_Landing\_Process wiki, we're supposed to wait for things to land on beta before asking for ESR approval. Is that right for security bugs too?
(In reply to Liz Henry (:lizzard) (needinfo? me) from [comment #37](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319070#c37 "VERIFIED FIXED - Web Extension's data: scheme pages can be controlled by other extensions"))
> Kris and zombie - Is ESR affected here?
From the most conservative point of view, yes, this code is present in esr45.
Beyond that, many other major parts of Web Extensions were not present in 45, so the likelihood of actual impact is IMO much lower. Unfortunately, I can't verify this, as I'm unable to build from the esr45 branch on Windows (`mach build` claims I need to run `mercurial-setup`, which throws with an unhelpful error).

> Hi :abillings,

Not trying to speak for :abillings, just to give details:
- the original patch got sec-approval+, the latest version changed just the commit message,
- the patch for aurora is a trivial back-port,
- the patch for beta/release is modified because the flag used in the original patch was not present in those versions of the code. IMO, this change does not modify the security implications of the patch.Flags: needinfo?(tomica)

bug-1319070-fix-v4.patch
[Security approval request comment]
Mostly the same as [comment #24](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319070#c24 "VERIFIED FIXED - Web Extension's data: scheme pages can be controlled by other extensions"), as the only thing changed is a commit message.
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not too easily. Understanding the issue in this bug could be considered easy (for a security researcher). Realizing that this could also apply to another extension's page is a first non-obvious leap IMO. Finally, constructing an exploit extension that navigates a "victim" extension's page to a data: URI is probably fairly hard (I'm not aware of a way to do that).
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included
> in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The tests are in a separate patch. The use of URI\_INHERITS\_SECURITY\_CONTEXT constant, and the comment above make it somewhat obvious this a security-related patch, especially if it lands linked to a protected bug. But nothing in the patch points to this applying for extension pages, the first necessary leap explained above.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
The original POC works on aurora. It doesn't work on beta and release, but that is related to the use of popup. Opening victim extension's page in a tab still allows the attacker extension to attach the content script after navigating to a data:URI. The `localStorage.get()` method call throws "Component is not available" for some reason, but that is only one venue of attack, there are likely others available to attacker that can attach a content script.
ESR 45 is potentially also affected, see [comment #39](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319070#c39 "VERIFIED FIXED - Web Extension's data: scheme pages can be controlled by other extensions") for details.
> If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
No bug. This is an architectural mismatch between Chrome's extension API and our inheriting principals for data: URIs.
> Do you have backports for the affected branches?
Yes, attached above, except for ESR 45, which I'm unable to build from source (will try via a push to try \_after\_ this lands to all other branches).
> If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
It was slightly different and not hard or risky.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
It is unlikely this will cause a lot of regressions. All existing web extensions tests pass with this patch applied.

Iris backed this out from Aurora for Jetpack failures. Not sure why this got uplifted to Aurora prior to landing on trunk, though, TBH.

Although this does violate the isolation WebExtensions are trying to create and is therefore important, in the bigger picture this is not a sec-high. If you install a malicious extension you're going to have a bad time and users don't know which add-ons are web extensions and which aren't.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty+Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

Hi Andy, Jorge, I am planning to take uplift in ESR45.7 (go-live late Jan). In [comment 56](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319070#c56 "VERIFIED FIXED - Web Extension's data: scheme pages can be controlled by other extensions"), there is a mention of milk risk to some webext that might notice breakage.

I was able to reproduce the initial issue on Firefox 53.0a1 (2016-11-21) under Windows 10 64-bit (the following window was promped: <http://screencast.com/t/mJVw2gPsRF>).
Manually tested on Firefox 53.0a1 (2017-01-10), Firefox 52.0a2 (2017-01-10), Firefox 51.0b13 (20170109165508) using Windows 10 64-bit, Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit and Mac OS X 10.12.1 and I noticed the following:
- “Null has been stolen by attacked” pop-up is prompted in the First Run Page after installing the attacker webextension: <http://screencast.com/t/r1bNdoiYvz5>
- received the “victim” value after clicking on “Click to Reproduce” link: <http://screencast.com/t/ZUd58xLUja>
- there is no “SECRET has been stolen by attacker” pop-up displayed.
Could you please confirm that this is the expected behavior?Flags: needinfo?(tomica)

There were recent changes to how Firefox treats data: URIs, specifically about inheriting principals.
Ni? myself to investigate if this is still a compat issue or not.Flags: needinfo?(tomica)

> about inheriting principals.
Principal inheritance for data: URIs is actually pretty weird at this point. They do inherit principals in most cases, but they're special cased in document loads:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/be78e6ea9b10b1f5b2b3b013f01d86e1062abb2b/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp#11267-11270>
SVG images with data: URLs, though, still wind up creating documents with inherited principals.

Also, recent blog post relevant to this
<https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/11/27/blocking-top-level-navigations-data-urls-firefox-58/>
So, the original POC in this bug wouldn't even work currently, since top-level navigation to data: URIs is blocked (which is probably worth documenting somewhere, separately from this issue).
But this remains a compat issue for data: iframes inside web pages, so it should still be documented.Flags: needinfo?(tomica)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:42.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/42.0
Build ID: 20151029151421
Steps to reproduce:
With Firefox 42 for Android , it's possible to make Clickjacking /CSRF attacks and possible URL and SSL Spoofing.
Step1 : go to <https://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/android-Firefox42.0-Clickjacking-CSRF-URL-and-SSL%20Spoofing/testfs.html> and click on the step1 link.
Step2 : click on the step2 Link.
step3 : an alert() JavaScript Function will be used for redirect the user on the tab opened by the first link (step1 link) and the location bar will appears like a secure webpage and show "<https://mobile.twitter.com/session/new>" but the visible content of the webpage is the content of "<https://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/android-Firefox42.0-Clickjacking-CSRF-URL-and-SSL%20Spoofing/testfs.html>" if your login and password for mobile.twitter.com is registred , by clicking on the button "ClickJack-twitter-login" you will be connected on your twitter account ( i will uploaded you a video and a screenshot for show you what this vulnerability is exactly)
Actual results:
An attacker can use this vulnerability for make clickjacking /CSRF attacks and possibly URL ans SSL Spoofing.
Expected results:
The visible content of the webpage is wrong and the real content of the URL showed is invisible and this can lead to ClickJacking and Cross-Site Request Forgery and also possible URL ans SSL Spoofing.

(The testcase has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5 4g+ and works very well)
In fact, the visible content is the content of the attacker webpage (eg: attacker.com) , but the real content is the content of the URL showed in the Location Bar (eg: bank.com) , its content is invisible but can be clicked , so this vulnerability can be used for multiple reason: ClickJacking attacks / CSRF attacks and I think it's possible to use this vulnerability for spoofed the URL and SSL into the location bar leading to a Location Bar Spoofing vulnerability, with the URL and the SSL indicator spoofed.
I will make a video for demonstrate you the dangerosity of this vulnerability soon (for an attack of ClickJacking / CSRF ).

Confirming (in Beta). The test loads twitter in an background tab which ends up drawing the twitter URL bar on top of the attacker's fullscreen page. Also uses alerts to steal focus back to the intended tab, which we're getting rid of on desktop because it's used for spoofing like pop-unders. I guess I should check on Nightly because that feature may have come to Fennec (different front end so maybe not).Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWtracking-fennec: ? → ---Ever confirmed: trueOS: Android → UnspecifiedHardware: ARM → Unspecified

The result is a pretty convincing spoof because the URL bar is real and functional, although if you go to the tab chooser and back then you get the real content. Can't quite rate it "high" because of the clunkiness of multiple clicks and waiting for things to load (will raise suspicions).Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

For Daniel Veditz: look [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222798#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 43 for Android : Clickjacking / CSRF attacks and Location Bar Spoofing (URL and SSL Spoofing)") before to read this comment.
Like you can view in this video ( <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8684962> ) into the attachments in this bug report,
This vulnerability can be used also for ClickJacking/CSRF attacks and I think that we can execute a XPI addon silently by a simple click on a button which is placed at the same place where the button of confirmation allowing the execution of this addon is also placed ( this attack is remotely possible ).
And like I already said in the [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222798#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 43 for Android : Clickjacking / CSRF attacks and Location Bar Spoofing (URL and SSL Spoofing)") where i sent a "needinfo flag" to Daniel Veditz {dveditz@mozilla.com} , I think that the actual testcase can be reduced.
Explaination : I think than it's possible to code a testcase wich require to click on only one link ( excepted the clicks on the alert() JavaScript functions which are needed for the actual exploitation).
But it is probable that we can reduce or use others functions than alert() for crafted a testcase which require a click on only one link , which also allowing to define this vulnerability like sg:high .Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

I've makes some tests for try to execute silently a XPI addon but i haven't found a way for do this.

Al, could you assign someone to code a patch for this vulnerability please?
In the last similar vulnerability ( [Bug 1149000](/show_bug.cgi?id=1149000 "RESOLVED FIXED - Killing the Location bar using fullscreen mode and alert function on another tab (spoofing risk)") ) , Kartikaya Gupta ( bugmail.mozilla@staktrace.com or kats@mozilla.com ) has been assigned and i think he could be again assigned for this new report.

(Sorry for the first needinfo without comment , it's an error of manipulation)
This vulnerability works again on all Firefox versions :
Firefox 45.0.1 (stable) , Firefox 46.0b4 (Beta) , Firefox 48.0a1 (Nightly) ...
I hope that this vulnerability allowing spoofing of URL and SSL, and also allowing clickjacking attacks and again others malicious results will be corrected quickly and that it does not happen the same problem that in [Bug1158439](/show_bug.cgi?id=1158439 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Cursor Can be totally invisible using flash object into an iframe with a big padding allow clickjacking of the addon installation button") (which have been defined obsolete after several updates due to multiple change of parameters essential to exploit this vulnerability).
So it is important to fix this vulnerability before that an update make it impossible to reproduce the proof of concept of this security bug report.
I've needinfo some Mozilla people which have also previously fixed some vulnerabilities in Firefox for Android.
Someone of you that i "needinfo?" can try to fix this vulnerability please?

What will change in a update that makes it impossible to reproduce this security issue? A change in Twitter's website? Ideally we should create a reduced testcase that doesn't depend on an external website.
Can you answer kats's question from [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222798#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 43 for Android : Clickjacking / CSRF attacks and Location Bar Spoofing (URL and SSL Spoofing)")? What is your recommended fix here?

For example: [Bug884488](/show_bug.cgi?id=884488 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Execute a XPI cover by a select/option element") and [Bug1158439](/show_bug.cgi?id=1158439 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Cursor Can be totally invisible using flash object into an iframe with a big padding allow clickjacking of the addon installation button") haven't been fixed but after several update, thses vulnerabilities have been defined obsolete even if these update haven't a fix for these Bug.

On Nightly 48.0a1 for Android ,
if you use a mouse connected to the android device, the testcase must use the onclick event because this Firefox Nightly version don't use the ontouchstart if you click with a cusor.
So in the Nightly 48.0a1 for android you must use onclick event and ontouchstart event (onclick event if a cursor is used and ontouchstart event if you touch the screen).Flags: needinfo?(jordi.chancel)

This testcase works perfectly on:
1) Firefox 45.0.1 (stable version)
2) Firefox 46.0b(\*) (Beta version).
But on Firefox 48.0a(\*) (Nightly vserion) you must use the last testcase uploaded for Nightly if you use a cursor on your Android device.

It's because the severity and the impact of this vulnerability are more important than [Bug1227538](/show_bug.cgi?id=1227538 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Javascript:\" URL scheme can seem secure with a SSL indicator (leading to SSL Spoofing) and the wrong URL indicated can mislead the user about the real URL visited."). and you was assigned on it before [Bug1227538](/show_bug.cgi?id=1227538 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Javascript:\" URL scheme can seem secure with a SSL indicator (leading to SSL Spoofing) and the wrong URL indicated can mislead the user about the real URL visited.").

@snorp: Does someone from the platform team have time to look into this? It seems like the frontend / browser chrome is behaving correctly but we end up in a situation where the "attacker's site" overlays another website (Great for Clickjacking).
What I see from debugging this:
\* (Tab 1) We load the demo site and update the chrome accordingly
\* The first link opens a new tab (Tab 2) (target="\_blank") and injects some html+js with a 10 second timeout to load twitter and show an alert. We automatically switch to the new tab.
\* (Tab 1) Additionally the first link (via ontouchstart) starts a 1 second timeout that shows an alert. This alert, after 1 second, leads to us automatically selecting tab 1 again. [1]
\* (Tab 1) The second link sets the tab to fullscreen mode.
\* (Tab 2) The 10 second timeout will fire, show an alert, we automatically select tab 2 again [1], leave the fullscreen mode [2], and will load Twitter.
\* We end up on tab 2 (Twitter) but still see the content of tab 1. Clicks on the content will click elements on Twitter's page. The chrome however correctly shows that we are on Twitter and the tabs tray has the correct selections and even shows a Twitter thumbnail.
Note: For this to "work" you have to have the right timing and click "link 2" before the 10 second timeout in tab 2 fires. If you just wait 10 seconds after clicking link 1 then we switch to tab 2 (because of the alert) and just load twitter normally. Going to fullscreen mode first is important for this bug. We actually have code in place to exit fullscreen mode when switching tabs [2] but this doesn't seem to help here.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1222798&attachment=8770664)

I think this exploit has been introduced with [bug 1161802](/show_bug.cgi?id=1161802 "RESOLVED FIXED - Put document in fullscreen state and trigger the event after sizemodechange"), which enables support for fullscreen transitions/fading.
This patch fixes the issue by finishing the DOM fullscreen change without delay.
I don't know whether this breaks fullscreen transitions or not, do we have tests for this?

Unconditionally doing this would certainly break the fullscreen transition. It would make the document change at the beginning of the transition.
Could you explain why the content of Tab 1 (the testcase page) is displayed over Tab 2 (the mobile twitter) if FinishDOMFullscreenChange is called asynchronously?

From what I can see, we fail because we set focus (nsFocusManager::SetFocus) before finishing the fullscreen change.
By finishing the DOM fullscreen change in sync, we make sure the fullscreen state is cleared first, before updating the focus. Otherwise, all Android-specific tab/content handling looks identical between the sync and async cases.
It's not clear to me, why preserving this sequence is important or how the focusing mechanics are supposed to work on Android with fullscreen transitions.

Apparently you cleared the needinfo immediately after setting it; sorry I didn't see this question. If you can reduce the testcase to something that could plausibly fool a user then we could raise the severity. I'm not optimistic that you can obscure the full-screen warning and prompt enough to make a user think everything is just fine and normal.

That would be a different PoC and possibly require an additional fix; please file as a separate bug.

I think we need to understand the details why this could happen. Does setting focus do anything about what would be displayed?
What FinishDOMFullscreenChange does when exiting fullscreen is basically just resetting the document state and queuing a fullscreenchange event to be dispatched in the next tick.
Having said that, probably it is because the refresh driver is unexpectedly activated by the queued event somehow? Could that be the case?

Attached patch

[0001-Bug-1222798-1.2-Update-tab-selection-after-fullscree.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8774441&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8774441&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1222798&attachment=8774441)

The behavior change (between the sync and async fullscreen change) in the focusing mechanics was triggered by changed frame visibility [1].
Reading the "sizemodechange" event handling on B2G, I think we need to adjust content visibility once the fullscreen transition has ended, but there is no such mechanic on Android afaik.
The way this is handled on Android is through the "Tab:Selected" event chain. We need to defer handling this event to the "fullscreenchange" handler, to make sure that the fullscreen transition has concluded.

I'm not familiar with the chrome js code on Android, but the logic looks reasonable.
I would consider this as a hacking fix. I think it would still be better to understand what really happens underneath, why the rendering could be out of sync with all other things.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
