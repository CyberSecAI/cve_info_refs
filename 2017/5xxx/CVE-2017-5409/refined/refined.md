  "CVE-2017-5409": {
    "description": "The Mozilla Windows updater can be called by a non-privileged user to delete an arbitrary local file by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.\n*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Mozilla Windows updater's callback parameter was vulnerable to path truncation. During an update, the callback parameter is used to generate a path to delete a file by appending a `.moz-callback` suffix. If the resulting path exceeds MAX_PATH (260 characters), it gets truncated. This allows a local attacker to construct a path with 259 characters which, after appending the suffix, will cause arbitrary file deletion.",

        "Path Truncation",
        "Privilege Escalation via arbitrary file deletion",
        "Improper input validation"

      "impact": "Arbitrary file deletion, leading to potential privilege escalation and system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation by calling the Mozilla Windows updater with a specially crafted path for the callback parameter, via the Mozilla Maintenance Service.",

 "CVE-2017-5410": {
    "description": "Memory corruption resulting in a potentially exploitable crash during garbage collection of JavaScript due to errors in how incremental sweeping is managed for memory cleanup.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ObjectValueMap::findZoneEdges` function where a key's zone is added to its delegate's zone's `gcZoneGroupEdges` set, even for delegate zones not currently marked. This `gcZoneGroupEdges` set is not cleared for these zones, causing them to hold zone pointers past the point where the zone can be destroyed which leads to a Use-After-Free.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
         "Memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "Potentially exploitable crash due to memory corruption.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during JavaScript garbage collection, likely exploitable by manipulating JavaScript code in a web page or application.",

"CVE-2017-5411": {
    "description": "A use-after-free can occur during buffer storage operations within the ANGLE graphics library, used for WebGL content. The buffer storage can be freed while still in use in some circumstances, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.\n*Note: This issue is in `libGLES`, which is only in use on Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free occurs in `Buffer11::updateBufferStorage` because `checkForDeallocation` can deallocate a buffer storage prematurely, before `updateBufferStorage` completes. This happens if `markBufferUsage` was not called with a certain buffer usage before deallocation and after `updateBufferStorage` has acquired the storage. This leads to the use of dangling pointer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
         "Memory corruption"
