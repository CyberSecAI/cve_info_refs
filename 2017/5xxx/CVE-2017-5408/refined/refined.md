Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper enforcement of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies when loading video captions. Specifically, video files loaded video captions cross-origin without checking for the presence of CORS headers which should permit such cross-origin use.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing CORS check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check for valid CORS headers when a video loads text track (captions) files from a different origin. This allows cross-origin access to potentially sensitive data without proper authorization.
- **Information Disclosure:** Due to the missing CORS check, an attacker can read the video captions via a cross-origin request and steal potentially private information in the captions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to extract text content, such as captions or subtitles, from a video served from a different origin. This could leak sensitive or private information if such information is included in the text tracks.
- **Same-Origin-Policy (SOP) Violation:** The vulnerability causes a violation of the same-origin policy, which is a core security mechanism in web browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Origin Request:** The attack vector is a cross-origin request initiated by a website under attacker's control to load a video resource which refers to captions located in a different origin.
- **Text Track Stealing**: The malicious JavaScript within the attacker's page can access the contents of the text tracks (captions) loaded from another origin by using `trackId.track.cues[i].getCueAsHTML()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious webpage to a victim user.
- **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs to embed JavaScript in their malicious page that exploits the lack of CORS checking to extract the text track.
- **Target Video Source**: The attacker needs to know the location of a video with cross-origin text track (captions).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was identified by Eric Lawrence of Chrome Security and was present in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird.
- Patches were issued by Mozilla to address this, and those patches were later incorporated into Red Hat products.
- Red Hat classified the severity of this issue as "moderate".
- Patches were created for ESR45, Firefox 52, 53, and 54 branches.
