{
  "CVE-2017-5459": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow in WebGL triggerable by web content, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in WebGL due to improper handling of input when using the `readPixels` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a crash or potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web content"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by crafting a malicious web page.",
     "extra_details": "The vulnerability is triggered using the `gl.readPixels` function with a large argument, causing the overflow in the WebGL code. The issue is present in the `WebGLContext::DoReadPixelsAndConvert` function in `dom/canvas/WebGLContextGL.cpp`.  The patch involved making the `WebGLContext Intersect` function fallible by using CheckedInts. This is needed because it was previously overflowing and was then used as a memory offset, resulting in a crash during the memcpy."
