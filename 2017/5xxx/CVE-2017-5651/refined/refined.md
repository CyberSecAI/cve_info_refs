  "CVE-2017-5651": {
    "Description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache Tomcat. Apache Tomcat versions 6.0.x below 6.0.53, 7.0.x below 7.0.77, 8.0.x below 8.0.43, 8.5.x below 8.5.13, 9.0.x below 9.0.0.M19 are susceptible to vulnerabilities which when successfully exploited could result in information disclosure, unauthorized reading or modification of data or Denial of Service(DoS).",
    "Root cause": "The root cause for this vulnerability lies in the affected versions of Apache Tomcat. Specifically, a race condition exists due to incorrect handling of Http11Processor objects in the recycledProcessors pool when using send file functionality. This allows the same processor to be used by multiple threads simultaneously which causes an IllegalStateException.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in handling of Http11Processor objects",
      "Improper recycling of Http11Processor objects",
      "Lack of thread safety in the recycledProcessors pool"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in information disclosure, unauthorized reading or modification of data or Denial of Service(DoS). Specifically, the identified race condition can lead to IllegalStateException, NullPointerException and subsequent denial of service due to failed request processing.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server.",
         "Exploitation of the send file functionality which leads to concurrency issues."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send network requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server.",
         "No specific privileges are needed, therefore unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability."
    ]
