Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5414:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The file picker dialog in Firefox could choose and display an incorrect default directory when instantiated due to how the application was handling the file picker dialog, specifically when using the `webkitdirectory` attribute on an input element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect default directory:** The file picker was not consistently selecting the correct default directory. It would sometimes default to the Desktop directory, regardless of the previously used directory, and on some OS configurations, it could reveal OS username through the default directory path.
- **Traversal of directories**: The file picker was also traversing the parent directory of the last selected directory when the user hit enter or selected a folder, thus moving up one directory level on each upload dialogue. This allowed an attacker to traverse the victim's file system.
- **Bypass of popup blocker:** The vulnerability could also be triggered by using `input.click()` to bypass the popup blocker, making it easier to automate the attack

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the user's OS username if the default directory was on the user's desktop or by navigating up the directory tree using the traversal vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could potentially trick a user into selecting or uploading files and entire folder from unintended locations, such as the "My Documents" folder.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious web page:** An attacker could create a malicious web page that uses the vulnerable `webkitdirectory` behavior to trigger the file picker dialog. The attacker could automate the attack with javascript and trigger multiple pop-ups using `input.click()` to bypass popup blockers.
- **XSS Vulnerability:** If a website that uses `webkitdirectory` is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could inject malicious code to trigger the vulnerability, or could embed vulnerable code from sites like codepen or jsfiddle to trick the user into selecting folders on their file system and exfiltrate information or gain access to files
- **URL Spoofing:** Possibly through URL spoofing, an attacker could trick the user into interacting with the malicious page and trigger the file picker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or inject malicious code into a website with `webkitdirectory` feature.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into interacting with the malicious page by visiting the page and hitting enter to select a folder or uploading a folder.
