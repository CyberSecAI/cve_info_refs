Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5611:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of data passed to the `WP_Query` class, specifically when handling post type names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The `WP_Query` class was vulnerable to SQL injection when processing unsanitized user-provided data related to post types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the WordPress database. This could lead to data breaches, modification of data, or other malicious actions.
- The vulnerability could be exploited by plugins or themes that used `WP_Query` without proper sanitization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability could be triggered by passing malicious input to the `WP_Query` class through user-controlled parameters.
- Plugins or themes using user-provided data in `WP_Query` could be exploited by attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is processed by `WP_Query` in a vulnerable way. This could involve interacting with vulnerable plugins or themes or directly manipulating user-controlled parameters if they are used in `WP_Query`.
- No authentication may be necessary depending on the vulnerable code.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The fix involved changing how post types are handled in the `WP_Query` class. The code was changed to use `esc_sql` for sanitization of the post type values.
- The vulnerable code was in `wp-includes/class-wp-query.php` around line 2257.

**Summary of Changes**:

The patch modifies the code in `wp-includes/class-wp-query.php` by adding `esc_sql` for sanitization of input.
```
- $where .= " AND {$wpdb->posts}.post_type IN ('" . join("', '", $in_search_post_types ) . "')";
+ $where .= " AND {$wpdb->posts}.post_type IN ('" . join( "', '", array_map( 'esc_sql', $in_search_post_types ) ) . "')";
```
```
- $where .= " AND {$wpdb->posts}.post_type IN ('" . join("', '", $post_type) . "')";
+ $where .= " AND {$wpdb->posts}.post_type IN ('" . join("', '", esc_sql( $post_type ) ) . "')";
```
```
- $where .= " AND {$wpdb->posts}.post_type = '$post_type'";
+ $where .= $wpdb->prepare( " AND {$wpdb->posts}.post_type = %s", $post_type );
```
The file `wp-includes/version.php` was also changed as part of the release, but does not have any security implications.
```
- $wp_version = '4.8-alpha-39951';
+ $wp_version = '4.8-alpha-39952';
```
