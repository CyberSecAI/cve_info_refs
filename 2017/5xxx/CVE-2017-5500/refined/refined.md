The provided content contains information about CVE-2017-5500.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a shift exponent that is too large for a 64-bit type, `jpc_fix_t`, which is aliased to `long`. This happens during the decoding of a JPEG2000 image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Left shift with an exponent that exceeds the limits of the target data type.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to a runtime error reported by the undefined behavior sanitizer (UBSAN). This could lead to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious JPEG2000 file to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or network access.
