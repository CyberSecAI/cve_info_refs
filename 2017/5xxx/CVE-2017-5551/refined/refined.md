Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix in the tmpfs implementation of the Linux kernel. The fix for CVE-2016-7097 aimed to clear the set-group-ID (SGID) bit when setting file permissions using `chmod` if the user was not a member of the group owner. However, this fix was not applied to tmpfs when setting POSIX ACLs through `setfacl` or `setxattr`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary vulnerability is the failure to clear the SGID bit when modifying file permissions on tmpfs via POSIX ACL settings (using `setfacl` or `setxattr`), when the user is not a member of the group owner. This deviates from the intended behavior when using `chmod`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

If exploited, a user who is the owner of an executable file on tmpfs can potentially gain the privileges of the file's group owner. This is because the SGID bit is not cleared when setting ACL, allowing the executable to run with group privileges. This could allow privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local Access:** A local attacker needs to have write access to a file on a tmpfs filesystem and be able to set file ACLs using `setfacl` or `setxattr`.
2.  **Specific Scenario:** The vulnerability can be exploited if a user does the following:
    *   Creates a file
    *   Changes file ownership to a user and group (using `chown`)
    *   Sets the SGID bit using `chmod 2755`
    *   Sets a POSIX ACL with setfacl or setxattr as a user that is not a member of the group owner, bypassing the intended check

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create files on a tmpfs file system, change ownership, set SGID permissions, and set POSIX ACL.
*   The attacker needs to not be a member of the group owner for the file they want to exploit

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is related to the fix for [CVE-2016-7097](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-7097), where the fix was not completely applied to the tmpfs filesystem.
*   The issue is demonstrated by the failure of `xfstest generic/375` to clear the setgid bit on tmpfs.
*   The fix involves clearing the SGID bit when a user who is not a member of the owning group sets a POSIX ACL on a tmpfs file.
