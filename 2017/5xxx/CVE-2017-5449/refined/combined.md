No, this has a different root cause, although it eventually crashes due to
a call to PopBidiControl with nothing on the mEmbeddingStack, which executes:

It looks like the issue here is that the first-in-flow (red color) has
a different 'unicode-bidi' computed value than the last continuation (blue).
This seems like a bug.
The nsBidiPresUtils code depends on GetBidiControl returning the same
value for all continuations, for Push/PopBidiControl to match:

(Sorry, got the colors wrong in the comment. The first-in-flow is blue, the last-in-flow is red.)

(In reply to Mats Palmgren (:mats) from [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1340127#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - SEGV in ClearBidiControls"))
> <span id="o22" style="writing-mode:sideways-lr">
It seems to happen with any vertical writing mode, including {sideways,vertical}-{lr,rl}, but not horizontal-tb.
> document.getElementById("o38").prepend(unescape('%u0627'),undefined);
This line is not related. The only thing this line does is to trigger bidi resolution, which is by default disabled. Adding any element with dir="rtl" would have the same effect.
> document.getElementById("o47").animate([{unicodeBidi: 'embed',}],100);
This seems to be necessary. It doesn't happen when you replace this with something like setTimeout, however, replacing it with a CSS animation would still work. So I guess there is something animation involves.

This was less reproducable under rr than I would have expected, but I did manage to get a recording of the crash under rr after a few tries.

So while I don't quite see what Mats saw in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1340127#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - SEGV in ClearBidiControls") (when debugging Xidorn's testcase, which is admittedly different), I think it provides a pretty clear explanation of what happened. While there might be a subtle bug in animations code, the intersection of animations and ::first-line is nontrivial and shouldn't lead to crashes. I think the Bidi code should just check for continuations that have different unicode-bidi style and treat such continuation boundaries as though they're separate elements.

Consider different bidi control/override values when deciding whether to consider a frame first or last
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: sec-moderate that's a relatively straightforward crash fix, and there could potentially be a more-exploitable bug lurking in the area
User impact if declined: crashes, most likely on fuzzer-generated content, probably not exploitable, but there's a chance there could be a different crash around that is
Fix Landed on Version: 53
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): quite low; it should only be changing behavior in a case that misbehaves. (Unless there's a missing null-check or something like that, but I don't think there is.)

I didn't managed to reproduce the crash using an affected build. I tried with both testcases from [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1340127#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - SEGV in ClearBidiControls") and [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1340127#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - SEGV in ClearBidiControls") on 45.9.0 esr, 51 Nightly ASAN builds. Also, I've tried to resize the window after the testcase was loaded but it did not crashed. (Ubuntu 16.04 x64 LTS)
David, do you have any idea on what I'm missing here, in order to reproduce this?
Thanks!Flags: needinfo?(dbaron)

Thanks Julien!
I can confirm both my testcase and the simplified testcase don't crashes the latest beta build.
My original testcase doesn't work on esr52 because of missing support for animate(), however I can confirm that the simplified testcase does not crash esr52.Flags: needinfo?(nils)

Attached file
[httpindex1.php](attachment.cgi?id=8843567)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8843567&action=edit)

Steps to reproduce:
--------------------
1. Build firefox with valgrind using instructions mentioned in
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Testing/Valgrind>
2. Download and copy httpindex1.php and httpindex2.php to local web server.
Web server should support PHP.
3. Start firefox
\* Enable Multi-process option should be disabled in firefox.
Otherwise firefox tab crash due to some other valgrind errors.
export VALGRIND\_OPTIONS="--smc-check=all-non-file --vex-iropt-register-updates=allregs-at-mem-access --show-mismatched-frees=no --read-inline-info=yes"
./mach run --debugger="valgrind" --debugger-args="$VALGRIND\_OPTIONS"
4. Visit httpindex1.php or httpindex2.php
Valgrind will display error. Valgrind output is attached under Crash Signature.
Cause of bug
-------------
Bug is in nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method of netwerk\streamconv\converters\nsDirIndexParser.cpp file.
"mFormat" int array created by this method can contain uninitialized value due to 2 reasons.
1. "http-index-format" content does not contain any format values.
ex: 200:\r\n
201:a\r\n
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method creates an int array with 2 elements for "mFormat", even though there are no values in format line.
2. "http-index-format" content contains invalid values.
ex: 200:a a a
201:a a a
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method creates an int array with 4 elements for "mFormat", even though there are invalid values in format line.

I've submitted a patch for (the very similar) [bug 1344461](/show_bug.cgi?id=1344461 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap buffer overflow in nsDirIndexParser::ParseData") that I expect will fix this issue as well.

Can you double-check that you have this commit in the Firefox build you run: <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/5ef67e15fd88> (originates from [bug 1344461](/show_bug.cgi?id=1344461 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap buffer overflow in nsDirIndexParser::ParseData")) I can't seem to reproduce any crashes using this recipe!

I checked again and commit was present.
Test case does not crash Firefox. But Valgrind shows "uninitialised value" error.
Valgrind shows this error only when "Enable multi-process Nightly" option is disabled.
But I don't think is bug is related to "Multi-process" option.

Comment on new test case (httpindex3.php)
-----------------------------------------
Bug fix (Below mentioned) correctly fixes initially attached test cases (httpindex1.php and httpindex2.php).
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method ->
mFormat[num] = -1;
+ mFormat[0] = -1; // to detect zero header fields
nsDirIndexParser::ParseData mehtod ->
+ if (mFormat[0] == -1) {
+ // no known header fields is an error
+ return NS\_ERROR\_ILLEGAL\_VALUE;
+ }
But fix can be bypassed, when first format value is valid and following format values are invalid.
ex:
<?php
header("Content-Type:application/http-index-format");
echo "200:Filename a a\r\n";
echo "201:a a a\r\n";

Thanks for the additional data.
The mFormat[] array that is filled in with identifier integers could end up with uninitialized array entries if a correct header field was followed by an incorrect one. This patch now sets all types to -1 first so that a mismatch will leave it initialized to the "unknown" type.

0001-bug-1344467-clear-the-format-type-for-unknown-types-.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Hard. It is easy to cause an access of uninitialized memory, but hard to take advantage of.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not very clearly, no
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This bug has been around in all code since October 2001.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The same patch should work on all branches
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Low risk due to the small size and minimal logical change.

Here's take 2. The previous version could still break out of the loop before the assignment and then cause reads of uninitialized data. I feel rather confident with this version.
There's try run going at <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=4cbdc417d41a93eadd61c89d745c763b1a7b7fdd&selectedJob=87789473> which unfortunately has an unusually large amount of intermittents.

Take 3.
Turns out fixing this bug triggered a different flow later on that caused test regressions. nsDirIndexParser::ParseData() really can't be allowed to return failure even for bad input as that then skips the necessary call to mListener->OnIndexAvailable().
This version of the patch makes changes ParseData() to still return on bad input, but return NS\_OK.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous, David Baron, Mats Palmgren, Ronald Crane, Bob Clary, and Chris Peterson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
