  "CVE-2017-5449": {
    "description": "A possibly exploitable crash triggered during layout and manipulation of bidirectional unicode text in concert with CSS animations.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by inconsistent handling of unicode-bidi styles during layout and manipulation of bidirectional text, especially when combined with CSS animations. This leads to the mEmbeddingStack becoming unbalanced and resulting in a crash during bidi control operations.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "memory corruption",
      "out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A crash that is possibly exploitable, leading to denial of service and potential code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious web content",
      "CSS animation",
      "Bidirectional unicode text manipulation"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML/CSS page that includes bidirectional unicode text and CSS animations, potentially requiring some degree of trial and error to reliably trigger the crash.",
