Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle, RSA Via Lifecycle and Governance, and RSA Identity Management and Governance (RSA IMG) products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The applications allow the storage of malicious scripts that are later executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary HTML Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML in a user's browser session, within the context of the vulnerable application. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the application
    - Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, meaning an attacker doesn't need physical access to the server.
- Low Privileged User: A low-privileged remote attacker is capable of exploiting these stored XSS vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
- Low privileges: The attacker needs to have a low privilege user account to exploit the vulnerability

**Summary**

CVE-2017-5004 is a stored XSS vulnerability that allows a low privileged remote attacker to execute arbitrary HTML in the userâ€™s browser session, within the context of the affected system. This is more detailed than the description given by the CVE ID placeholder.
