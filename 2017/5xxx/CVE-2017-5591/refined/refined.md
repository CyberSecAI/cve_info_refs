Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of the XMPP extension "XEP-0280: Message Carbons" in multiple XMPP clients, including poezio (specifically versions 0.8 - 0.10) and the related libraries SleekXMPP (up to 1.3.1) and Slixmpp (all versions up to 1.2.3).  The core issue is that these clients failed to verify that forwarded carbon copies originated from the user's bare JID, as mandated by the XEP-0280 specification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Source Verification:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of the 'from' attribute in received carbon copy messages. Vulnerable clients blindly accepted carbon copies from any source.
*   **Improper Handling of Forwarded Messages:** The clients failed to check if the source of a carbon copy message was from the user's bare JID, thus allowing for spoofing of messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Impersonation:** A remote attacker can impersonate any user, including contacts, in the vulnerable application's display. This allows for various kinds of social engineering attacks.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker can craft messages that appear to come from a trusted contact, potentially tricking the user into taking actions they would not normally take.
*  **Manipulation:** By forging messages from other users, attackers could potentially manipulate conversations or spread misinformation within the XMPP client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attacker sends a specially crafted XMPP message to the victim.
*   **Exploiting Carbons:** The attack leverages the "Message Carbons" XMPP extension to send a forged message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:**  The attacker can be remote and does not need to be on the same network.
*   **XMPP Account:** The attacker must have an XMPP account.
*   **Ability to Send XMPP Messages:** The attacker must be able to send messages to a target user.
*   **Knowledge of Victim's JID:** The attacker needs to know the target user's JID.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is not specific to a single client; multiple XMPP clients were affected.
*   The fix involves verifying that the `from` field of carbon copy messages matches the user's JID.
*  The provided commit log shows the fix being applied to `slixmpp/plugins/xep_0280/carbons.py` with the addition of a check `if msg['from'].bare == self.xmpp.boundjid.bare:`.
* The vulnerability is classified with CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication and CWE-940: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel
