Subject: Multiple memory access issues in gstreamer

Hi,

<https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.10/#1.10.3>

gstreamer 1.10.3 got released, from the release notes:
"Various fixes for crashes, assertions, deadlocks and memory leaks on
fuzzed input files and in other situations"

Here they are (at least the ones I reported):

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775450>
gst-plugins-good/aacparse: invalid memory read in
gst_aac_parse_sink_setcaps

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775451>
gst-plugins-good/qtdemux: out of bounds read in qtdemux_tag_add_str_full

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777262>
gst-plugins-base/riff-media: floating point exception in
gst_riff_create_audio_caps

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777263>
gstreamer core/datetime: out of bounds read in
gst_date_time_new_from_iso8601_string()

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777265>
gst-plugins-base/riff: stack overflow in gst_riff_create_audio_caps

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777469>
gst-plugins-good/qtdemux: out of bounds heap read in
qtdemux_parse_samples

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777500>
gst-plugins-good/avidemux: gst_avi_demux_parse_ncdt heap out of bounds
read

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777502>
gst-plugins-base/samiparse: heap oob in html_context_handle_element

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777503>
gst-plugins-bad/mxfdemux: use after free in gst_mini_object_unref /
gst_tag_list_unref / gst_mxf_demux_update_essence_tracks

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777525>
gst-plugins-base: floating point exception in gst_riff_create_audio_caps
(different than #777262)

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777532>
gst-plugins-good/avidemux: invalid memory read in
gst_avi_demux_parse_ncdt

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777937>
gst-plugins-ugly/asfdemux: invalid memory read in
gst_asf_demux_process_ext_stream_props()

And more that didn't make it into 1.10.3:

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777955>
gst-plugins-ugly/asfdemux: out of bounds read in
gst_asf_demux_process_ext_content_desc

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777957>
gst-plugins-bad/mpegdemux: Invalid memory read in gst_ps_demux_parse_psm

(example files are always attached or linked in the bug reports)

I also reported multiple other issues like memory leaks or hangs which
I consider have no security relevance.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

The latest bug-fix release in the 1.10 series is [1.10.5](#1.10.5) and was released on 15 June 2017.  The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new major feature release in the stable 1.x API series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!  As always, this release is again packed with new features, bug fixes and other improvements.  See <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.10/> for the latest version of this document.  *Last updated: Thursday 15 Jun 2017, 09:30 UTC [(log)](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/www/log/src/htdocs/releases/1.10/release-notes-1.10.md)* Introduction The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new major feature release in the stable 1.x API series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!  As always, this release is again packed with new features, bug fixes and other improvements. Highlights  * Several convenience APIs have been added to make developers' lives easier * A new `GstStream` API provides applications a more meaningful view of the   structure of streams, simplifying the process of dealing with media in   complex container formats * Experimental `decodebin3` and `playbin3` elements which bring a number of   improvements which were hard to implement within `decodebin` and `playbin` * A new `parsebin` element to automatically unpack and parse a stream, stopping   just short of decoding * Experimental new `meson`-based build system, bringing faster build and much   better Windows support (including for building with Visual Studio) * A new `gst-docs` module has been created, and we are in the process of moving   our documentation to a markdown-based format for easier maintenance and   updates * A new `gst-examples` module has been created, which contains example   GStreamer applications and is expected to grow with many more examples in   the future * Various OpenGL and OpenGL|ES-related fixes and improvements for greater   efficiency on desktop and mobile platforms, and Vulkan support on Wayland was   also added * Extensive improvements to the VAAPI plugins for improved robustness and   efficiency * Lots of fixes and improvements across the board, spanning RTP/RTSP, V4L2,   Bluetooth, audio conversion, echo cancellation, and more!  Major new features and changesNoteworthy new API, features and other changesCore API additionsReceive property change notifications via bus messages New API was added to receive element property change notifications via bus messages. So far, applications had to connect a callback to an element's `notify::property-name` signal via the GObject API, which was inconvenient for at least two reasons: one had to implement a signal callback function, and that callback function would usually be called from one of the streaming threads, so one had to marshal (send) any information gathered or pending requests to the main application thread which was tedious and error-prone.  Enter [`gst_element_add_property_notify_watch()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-add-property-notify-watch) and [`gst_element_add_property_deep_notify_watch()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-add-property-deep-notify-watch) which will watch for changes of a property on the specified element, either only for this element or recursively for a whole bin or pipeline. Whenever such a property change happens, a `GST_MESSAGE_PROPERTY_NOTIFY` message will be posted on the pipeline bus with details of the element, the property and the new property value, all of which can be retrieved later from the message in the application via [`gst_message_parse_property_notify()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstMessage.html#gst-message-parse-property-notify). Unlike the GstBus watch functions, this API does not rely on a running GLib main loop.  The above can be used to be notified asynchronously of caps changes in the pipeline, or volume changes on an audio sink element, for example. GstBin "deep" element-added and element-removed signals GstBin has gained `"deep-element-added"` and `"deep-element-removed"` signals which makes it easier for applications and higher-level plugins to track when elements are added or removed from a complex pipeline with multiple sub-bins.  `playbin` makes use of this to implement the new `"element-setup"` signal which can be used to configure elements as they are added to `playbin`, just like the existing `"source-setup"` signal which can be used to configure the source element created. Error messages can contain additional structured details It is often useful to provide additional, structured information in error, warning or info messages for applications (or higher-level elements) to make intelligent decisions based on them. To allow this, error, warning and info messages now have API for adding arbitrary additional information to them using a `GstStructure`: [`GST_ELEMENT_ERROR_WITH_DETAILS`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#GST-ELEMENT-ERROR-WITH-DETAILS:CAPS) and corresponding API for the other message types.  This is now used e.g. by the new [`GST_ELEMENT_FLOW_ERROR`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#GST-ELEMENT-FLOW-ERROR:CAPS) API to include the actual flow error in the error message, and the [souphttpsrc element](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-good/tree/ext/soup/gstsouphttpsrc.c?id=60d30db912a1aedd743e66b9dcd2e21d71fbb24f#n1318) to provide the HTTP status code, and the URL (if any) to which a redirection has happened. Redirect messages have official API now Sometimes, elements need to redirect the current stream URL and tell the application to proceed with this new URL, possibly using a different protocol too (thus changing the pipeline configuration). Until now, this was informally implemented using `ELEMENT` messages on the bus.  Now this has been formalized in the form of a new `GST_MESSAGE_REDIRECT` message. A new redirect message can be created using [`gst_message_new_redirect()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstMessage.html#gst-message-new-redirect). If needed, multiple redirect locations can be specified by calling [`gst_message_add_redirect_entry()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstMessage.html#gst-message-add-redirect-entry) to add further redirect entries, all with metadata, so the application can decide which is most suitable (e.g. depending on the bitrate tags). New pad linking convenience functions that automatically create ghost pads New pad linking convenience functions were added: [`gst_pad_link_maybe_ghosting()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstPad.html#gst-pad-link-maybe-ghosting) and [`gst_pad_link_maybe_ghosting_full()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstPad.html#gst-pad-link-maybe-ghosting-full) which were previously internal to GStreamer have now been exposed for general use.  The existing pad link functions will refuse to link pads or elements at different levels in the pipeline hierarchy, requiring the developer to create ghost pads where necessary. These new utility functions will automatically create ghostpads as needed when linking pads at different levels of the hierarchy (e.g. from an element inside a bin to one that's at the same level in the hierarchy as the bin, or in another bin). Miscellaneous Pad probes: IDLE and BLOCK probes now work slightly differently in pull mode, so that push and pull mode have opposite scenarios for idle and blocking probes. In push mode, it will block with some data type and IDLE won't have any data. In pull mode, it will block *before* getting a buffer and will be IDLE once some data has been obtained. ([commit](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/commit/gst/gstpad.c?id=368ee8a336d0c868d81fdace54b24431a8b48cbf), [bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=761211))  [`gst_parse_launch_full()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstParse.html#gst-parse-launch-full) can now be made to return a `GstBin` instead of a top-level pipeline by passing the new `GST_PARSE_FLAG_PLACE_IN_BIN` flag.  The default GStreamer debug log handler can now be removed before calling `gst_init()`, so that it will never get installed and won't be active during initialization.  A new [`STREAM_GROUP_DONE` event](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-stream-group-done) was added. In some ways it works similar to the `EOS` event in that it can be used to unblock downstream elements which may be waiting for further data, such as for example `input-selector`. Unlike `EOS`, further data flow may happen after the `STREAM_GROUP_DONE` event though (and without the need to flush the pipeline). This is used to unblock input-selector when switching between streams in adaptive streaming scenarios (e.g. HLS).  The `gst-launch-1.0` command line tool will now print unescaped caps in verbose mode (enabled by the -v switch).  [`gst_element_call_async()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-call-async) has been added as convenience API for plugin developers. It is useful for one-shot operations that need to be done from a thread other than the current streaming thread. It is backed by a thread-pool that is shared by all elements.  Various race conditions have been fixed around the `GstPoll` API used by e.g. `GstBus` and `GstBufferPool`. Some of these manifested themselves primarily on Windows.  `GstAdapter` can now keep track of discontinuities signalled via the `DISCONT` buffer flag, and has gained [new API](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-libs/html/GstAdapter.html#gst-adapter-pts-at-discont) to track PTS, DTS and offset at the last discont. This is useful for plugins implementing advanced trick mode scenarios.  `GstTestClock` gained a new [`"clock-type"` property](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-libs/html/GstTestClock.html#GstTestClock--clock-type). GstStream API for stream announcement and stream selection New stream listing and stream selection API: new API has been added to provide high-level abstractions for streams ([`GstStream`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstStream.html)) and collections of streams ([`GstStreamCollections`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstStreamCollection.html)). Stream listing A [`GstStream`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstStream.html) contains all the information pertinent to a stream, such as stream id, caps, tags, flags and stream type(s); it can represent a single elementary stream (e.g. audio, video, subtitles, etc.) or a container stream. This will depend on the context. In a decodebin3/playbin3 one it will typically be elementary streams that can be selected and unselected.  A [`GstStreamCollection`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstStreamCollection.html) represents a group of streams and is used to announce or publish all available streams. A GstStreamCollection is immutable - once created it won't change. If the available streams change, e.g. because a new stream appeared or some streams disappeared, a new stream collection will be published. This new stream collection may contain streams from the previous collection if those streams persist, or completely new ones. Stream collections do not yet list all theoretically available streams, e.g. other available DVD angles or alternative resolutions/bitrate of the same stream in case of adaptive streaming.  New events and messages have been added to notify or update other elements and the application about which streams are currently available and/or selected. This way, we can easily and seamlessly let the application know whenever the available streams change, as happens frequently with digital television streams for example. The new system is also more flexible. For example, it is now also possible for the application to select multiple streams of the same type (e.g. in a transcoding/transmuxing scenario).  A [`STREAM_COLLECTION` message](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstMessage.html#gst-message-new-stream-collection) is posted on the bus to inform the parent bin (e.g. `playbin3`, `decodebin3`) and/or the application about what streams are available, so you no longer have to hunt for this information at different places. The available information includes number of streams of each type, caps, tags etc. Bins and/or the application can intercept the message synchronously to select and deselect streams before any data is produced - for the case where elements such as the demuxers support the new stream API, not necessarily in the parsebin compatibility fallback case.  Similarly, there is also a [`STREAM_COLLECTION` event](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-stream-collection) to inform downstream elements of the available streams. This event can be used by elements to aggregate streams from multiple inputs into one single collection.  The `STREAM_START` event was extended so that it can also contain a GstStream object with all information about the current stream, see [`gst_event_set_stream()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-set-stream) and [`gst_event_parse_stream()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-parse-stream). [`gst_pad_get_stream()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstPad.html#gst-pad-get-stream) is a new utility function that can be used to look up the GstStream from the `STREAM_START` sticky event on a pad. Stream selection Once the available streams have been published, streams can be selected via their stream ID using the new `SELECT_STREAMS` event, which can be created with [`gst_event_new_select_streams()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-select-streams). The new API supports selecting multiple streams per stream type. In the future, we may also implement explicit deselection of streams that will never be used, so elements can skip these and never expose them or output data for them in the first place.  The application is then notified of the currently selected streams via the new `STREAMS_SELECTED` message on the pipeline bus, containing both the current stream collection as well as the selected streams. This might be posted in response to the application sending a `SELECT_STREAMS` event or when `decodebin3` or `playbin3` decide on the streams to be initially selected without application input. Further reading See further below for some notes on the new elements supporting this new stream API, namely: `decodebin3`, `playbin3` and `parsebin`.  More information about the new API and the new elements can also be found here:   * GStreamer [stream selection design docs](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/tree/docs/design/part-stream-selection.txt) * Edward Hervey's talk ["The new streams API: Design and usage"](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/the-new-gststream-api-design-and-usage/) ([slides](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/events/gstreamer-conference/2016/Edward%20Hervey%20-%20The%20New%20Streams%20API%20Design%20and%20Usage.pdf)) * Edward Hervey's talk ["Decodebin3: Dealing with modern playback use cases"](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/decodebin3-or-dealing-with-modern-playback-use-cases/) ([slides](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/events/gstreamer-conference/2015/Edward%20Hervey%20-%20decodebin3.pdf))  Audio conversion and resampling API The audio conversion library received a completely new and rewritten audio resampler, complementing the audio conversion routines moved into the audio library in the [previous release](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.8/). Integrating the resampler with the other audio conversion library allows us to implement generic conversion much more efficiently, as format conversion and resampling can now be done in the same processing loop instead of having to do it in separate steps (our element implementations do not make use of this yet though).  The new audio resampler library is a combination of some of the best features of other samplers such as ffmpeg, speex and SRC. It natively supports S16, S32, F32 and F64 formats and uses optimized x86 and neon assembly for most of its processing. It also has support for dynamically changing sample rates by incrementally updating the filter tables using linear or cubic interpolation. According to some benchmarks, it's one of the fastest and most accurate resamplers around.  The `audioresample` plugin has been ported to the new audio library functions to make use of the new resampler. Support for SMPTE timecodes Support for SMPTE timecodes was added to the GStreamer video library. This comes with an abstraction for timecodes, [`GstVideoTimeCode`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-gstvideo.html#GstVideoTimeCode) and a [`GstMeta`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-gstvideometa.html#gst-buffer-add-video-time-code-meta) that can be placed on video buffers for carrying the timecode information for each frame. Additionally there is various API for making handling of timecodes easy and to do various calculations with them.  A new plugin called [`timecode`](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/tree/gst/timecode) was added, that contains an element called `timecodestamper` for putting the timecode meta on video frames based on counting the frames and another element called `timecodewait` that drops all video (and audio) until a specific timecode is reached.  Additionally support was added to the Decklink plugin for including the timecode information when sending video out or capturing it via SDI, the `qtmux` element is able to write timecode information into the MOV container, and the `timeoverlay` element can overlay timecodes on top of the video.  More information can be found in the [talk about timecodes](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/smpte-timecodes-in-gstreamer/) at the GStreamer Conference 2016. GStreamer OpenMAX IL plugin The last gst-omx release, 1.2.0, was in July 2014. It was about time to get a new one out with all the improvements that have happened in the meantime. From now on, we will try to release gst-omx together with all other modules.  This release features a lot of bugfixes, improved support for the Raspberry Pi and in general improved support for zerocopy rendering via EGL and a few minor new features.  At this point, gst-omx is known to work best on the Raspberry Pi platform but it is also known to work on various other platforms. Unfortunately, we are not including configurations for any other platforms, so if you happen to use gst-omx: please send us patches with your configuration and code changes! New Elementsdecodebin3, playbin3, parsebin (experimental) This release features new decoding and playback elements as experimental technology previews: `decodebin3` and `playbin3` will soon supersede the existing `decodebin` and `playbin` elements. We skipped the number 2 because it was already used back in the 0.10 days, which might cause confusion. Experimental technology preview means that everything should work fine already, but we can't guarantee there won't be minor behavioural changes in the next cycle. In any case, please test and report any problems back.  Before we go into detail about what these new elements improve, let's look at the new [`parsebin`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-parsebin.html) element. It works similarly to `decodebin` and `decodebin3`, only that it stops one step short and does not plug any actual decoder elements. It will only plug parsers, tag readers, demuxers and depayloaders. Also note that parsebin does not contain any queueing element.  [`decodebin3`'s](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-decodebin3.html) internal architecture is slightly different from the existing `decodebin` element and fixes many long-standing issues with our decoding engine. For one, data is now fed into the internal `multiqueue` element *after* it has been parsed and timestamped, which means that the `multiqueue` element now has more knowledge and is able to calculate the interleaving of the various streams, thus minimizing memory requirements and doing away with magic values for buffering limits that were conceived when videos were 240p or 360p. Anyone who has tried to play back 4k video streams with decodebin2 will have noticed the limitations of that approach. The improved timestamp tracking also enables `multiqueue` to keep streams of the same type (audio, video) aligned better, making sure switching between streams of the same type is very fast.  Another major improvement in `decodebin3` is that it will no longer decode streams that are not being used. With the old `decodebin` and `playbin`, when there were 8 audio streams we would always decode all 8 streams even if 7 were not actually used. This caused a lot of CPU overhead, which was particularly problematic on embedded devices. When switching between streams `decodebin3` will try hard to re-use existing decoders. This is useful when switching between multiple streams of the same type if they are encoded in the same format.  Re-using decoders is also useful when the available streams change on the fly, as might happen with radio streams (chained Oggs), digital television broadcasts, when adaptive streaming streams change bitrate, or when switching gaplessly to the next title. In order to guarantee a seamless transition, the old `decodebin2` would plug a second decoder for the new stream while finishing up the old stream. With `decodebin3`, this is no longer needed - at least not when the new and old format are the same. This will be particularly useful on embedded systems where it is often not possible to run multiple decoders at the same time, or when tearing down and setting up decoders is fairly expensive.  `decodebin3` also allows for multiple input streams, not just a single one. This will be useful, in the future, for gapless playback, or for feeding multiple external subtitle streams to decodebin/playbin.  `playbin3` uses `decodebin3` internally, and will supercede `playbin`. It was decided that it would be too risky to make the old `playbin` use the new `decodebin3` in a backwards-compatible way. The new architecture makes it awkward, if not impossible, to maintain perfect backwards compatibility in some aspects, hence `playbin3` was born, and developers can migrate to the new element and new API at their own pace.  All of these new elements make use of the new `GstStream` API for listing and selecting streams, as described above. `parsebin` provides backwards compatibility for demuxers and parsers which do not advertise their streams using the new API yet (which is most).  The new elements are not entirely feature-complete yet: `playbin3` does not support so-called decodersinks yet where the data is not decoded inside GStreamer but passed directly for decoding to the sink. `decodebin3` is missing the various `autoplug-*` signals to influence which decoders get autoplugged in which order. We're looking to add back this functionality, but it will probably be in a different way, with a single unified signal and using GstStream perhaps.  For more information on these new elements, check out Edward Hervey's talk [*decodebin3 - dealing with modern playback use cases*](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/decodebin3-or-dealing-with-modern-playback-use-cases/) LV2 ported from 0.10 and switched from slv2 to lilv2 The LV2 wrapper plugin has been ported to 1.0 and moved from using the deprecated slv2 library to its replacement liblv2. We support sources and filter elements. lv2 is short for *Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API (LADSPA) version 2* and is an open standard for audio plugins which includes support for audio synthesis (generation), digital signal processing of digital audio, and MIDI. The new lv2 plugin supersedes the existing LADSPA plugin. WebRTC DSP Plugin for echo-cancellation, gain control and noise suppression A set of new elements ([webrtcdsp](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-bad-plugins/html/gst-plugins-bad-plugins-webrtcdsp.html), [webrtcechoprobe](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-bad-plugins/html/gst-plugins-bad-plugins-webrtcechoprobe.html)) based on the WebRTC DSP software stack can now be used to improve your audio voice communication pipelines. They support echo cancellation, gain control, noise suppression and more. For more details you may read [Nicolas' blog post](https://ndufresne.ca/2016/06/gstreamer-echo-canceller/). Fraunhofer FDK AAC encoder and decoder New encoder and decoder elements wrapping the Fraunhofer FDK AAC library have been added (`fdkaacdec`, `fdkaacdec`). The Fraunhofer FDK AAC encoder is generally considered to be a very high-quality AAC encoder, but unfortunately it comes under a non-free license with the option to obtain a paid, commercial license. Noteworthy element features and additionsMajor RTP and RTSP improvements  * The RTSP server and source element, as well as the RTP jitterbuffer now support   remote clock synchronization according to [RFC7273][https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7273]. * Support for application and profile specific RTCP packets was added. * The H265/HEVC payloader/depayloader is again in sync with the final RFC. * Seeking stability of the RTSP source and server was improved a lot and   runs stably now, even when doing scrub-seeking. * The RTSP server received various major bugfixes, including for regressions that   caused the IP/port address pool to not be considered, or NAT hole punching   to not work anymore. [Bugzilla #766612][https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=766612] * Various other bugfixes that improve the stability of RTP and RTSP, including   many new unit / integration tests.  Improvements to splitmuxsrc and splitmuxsink  * The splitmux element received reliability and error handling improvements,   removing at least one deadlock case. `splitmuxsrc` now stops cleanly at the end   of the segment when handling seeks with a stop time. We fixed a bug with large   amounts of downstream buffering causing incorrect out-of-sequence playback. * `splitmuxsrc` now has a `"format-location"` signal to directly specify the list   of files to play from. * `splitmuxsink` can now optionally send force-keyunit events to upstream   elements to allow splitting files more accurately instead of having to wait   for upstream to provide a new keyframe by itself.  OpenGL/GLES improvementsiOS and macOS (OS/X)  * We now create OpenGL|ES 3.x contexts on iOS by default with a fallback to   OpenGL|ES 2.x if that fails. * Various zerocopy decoding fixes and enhancements with the   encoding/decoding/capturing elements. * libdispatch is now used on all Apple platforms instead of GMainLoop, removing   the expensive poll()/pthread\_\*() overhead.  New API  * `GstGLFramebuffer` - for wrapping OpenGL frame buffer objects. It provides   facilities for attaching `GstGLMemory` objects to the necessary attachment   points, binding and unbinding and running a user-supplied function with the   framebuffer bound. * `GstGLRenderbuffer` (a `GstGLBaseMemory` subclass) - for wrapping OpenGL   render buffer objects that are typically used for depth/stencil buffers or   for color buffers where we don't care about the output. * `GstGLMemoryEGL` (a `GstGLMemory` subclass) - for combining `EGLImage`s with a GL   texture that replaces `GstEGLImageMemory` bringing the improvements made to the   other `GstGLMemory` implementations. This fixes a performance regression in   zerocopy decoding on the Raspberry Pi when used with an updated gst-omx.  Miscellaneous improvements  * `gltestsrc` is now usable on devices/platforms with OpenGL 3.x and OpenGL|ES   and has completed or gained support for new patterns in line with the   existing ones in `videotestsrc`. * `gldeinterlace` is now available on devices/platforms with OpenGL|ES   implementations. * The dispmanx backend (used on the Raspberry Pi) now supports the   `gst_video_overlay_set_window_handle()` and   `gst_video_overlay_set_render_rectangle()` functions. * The `gltransformation` element now correctly transforms mouse coordinates (in   window space) to stream coordinates for both perspective and orthographic   projections. * The `gltransformation` element now detects if the   `GstVideoAffineTransformationMeta` is supported downstream and will efficiently   pass its transformation downstream. This is a performance improvement as it   results in less processing being required. * The wayland implementation now uses the multi-threaded safe event-loop API   allowing correct usage in applications that call wayland functions from   multiple threads. * Support for native 90 degree rotations and horizontal/vertical flips   in `glimagesink`.  Vulkan  * The Vulkan elements now work under Wayland and have received numerous   bugfixes.  QML elements  * `qmlglsink` video sink now works on more platforms, notably, Windows, Wayland,   and Qt's eglfs (for embedded devices with an OpenGL implementation) including   the Raspberry Pi. * New element `qmlglsrc` to record a QML scene into a GStreamer pipeline.  KMS video sink  * New element `kmssink` to render video using Direct Rendering Manager   (DRM) and Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) subsystems in the Linux   kernel. It is oriented to be used mostly in embedded systems.  Wayland video sink  * `waylandsink` now supports the wl\_viewporter extension allowing   video scaling and cropping to be delegated to the Wayland   compositor. This extension is also been made optional, so that it can   also work on current compositors that don't support it. It also now has   support for the video meta, allowing zero-copy operations in more   cases.  DVB improvements  * `dvbsrc` now has better delivery-system autodetection and several   new parameter sanity-checks to improve its resilience to configuration   omissions and errors. Superfluous polling continues to be trimmed down,   and the debugging output has been made more consistent and precise.   Additionally, the channel-configuration parser now supports the new dvbv5   format, enabling `dvbbasebin` to automatically playback content transmitted   on delivery systems that previously required manual description, like ISDB-T.  DASH, HLS and adaptivedemux  * HLS now has support for Alternate Rendition audio and video tracks. Full   support for Alternate Rendition subtitle tracks will be in an upcoming release. * DASH received support for keyframe-only trick modes if the   `GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_KEY_UNITS` flag is given when seeking. It will   only download keyframes then, which should help with high-speed playback.   Changes to skip over multiple frames based on bandwidth and other metrics   will be added in the near future. * Lots of reliability fixes around seek handling and bitrate switching.  Bluetooth improvements  * The `avdtpsrc` element now supports metadata such as track title, artist   name, and more, which devices can send via AVRCP. These are published as   tags on the pipeline. * The `a2dpsink` element received some love and was cleaned up so that it   actually works after the initial GStreamer 1.0 port.  GStreamer VAAPI  * All the decoders have been split, one plugin feature per codec. So   far, the available ones, depending on the driver, are:   `vaapimpeg2dec`, `vaapih264dec`, `vaapih265dec`, `vaapivc1dec`, `vaapivp8dec`,   `vaapivp9dec` and `vaapijpegdec` (which already was split). * Improvements when mapping VA surfaces into memory. It now differentiates   between negotiation caps and allocations caps, since the allocation   memory for surfaces may be bigger than one that is going to be   mapped. * `vaapih265enc` now supports constant bitrate mode (CBR). * Since several VA drivers are unmaintained, we decide to keep a whitelist   with the va drivers we actually test, which is mostly the i915 and to a lesser   degree gallium from the mesa project. Exporting the environment variable   `GST_VAAPI_ALL_DRIVERS` disables the whitelist. * Plugin features are registered at run-time, according to their support by   the loaded VA driver. So only the decoders and encoder supported by the   system are registered. Since the driver can change, some dependencies are   tracked to invalidate the GStreamer registry and reload the plugin. * `dmabuf` importation from upstream has been improved, gaining performance. * `vaapipostproc` now can negotiate buffer transformations via caps. * Decoders now can do I-frame only reverse playback. This decodes I-frames   only because the surface pool is smaller than the required by the GOP to show all the   frames. * The upload of frames onto native GL textures has been optimized too, keeping   a cache of the internal structures for the offered textures by the sink.  V4L2 changes  * More pixels formats are now supported * Decoder is now using `G_SELECTION` instead of the deprecated `G_CROP` * Decoder now uses the `STOP` command to handle EOS * Transform element can now scale the pixel aspect ratio * Colorimetry support has been improved even more * We now support the `OUTPUT_OVERLAY` type of video node in v4l2sink  Miscellaneous  * `multiqueue`'s input pads gained a new `"group-id"` property which   can be used to group input streams. Typically one will assign   different id numbers to audio, video and subtitle streams for   example. This way `multiqueue` can make sure streams of the same   type advance in lockstep if some of the streams are unlinked and the   `"sync-by-running-time"` property is set. This is used in   decodebin3/playbin3 to implement almost-instantaneous stream   switching. The grouping is required because different downstream   paths (audio, video, etc.) may have different buffering/latency   etc. so might be consuming data from multiqueue with a slightly   different phase, and if we track different stream groups separately   we minimize stream switching delays and buffering inside the   `multiqueue`. * `alsasrc` now supports ALSA drivers without a position for each   channel, this is common in some professional or industrial hardware. * `libvpx` based decoders (`vp8dec` and `vp9dec`) now create multiple threads on   computers with multiple CPUs automatically. * `rfbsrc` - used for capturing from a VNC server - has seen a lot of   debugging. It now supports the latest version of the RFB   protocol and uses GIO everywhere. * `tsdemux` can now read ATSC E-AC-3 streams. * New `GstVideoDirection` video orientation interface for rotating, flipping   and mirroring video in 90Â° steps. It is implemented by the `videoflip` and   `glvideoflip` elements currently. * It is now possible to give `appsrc` a duration in time, and there is now a   non-blocking try-pull API for `appsink` that returns NULL if nothing is   available right now. * `x264enc` has support now for chroma-site and colorimetry settings * A new JPEG2000 parser element was added, and the JPEG2000 caps were cleaned   up and gained more information needed in combination with RTP and various   container formats. * Reverse playback support for `videorate` and `deinterlace` was implemented * Various improvements everywhere for reverse playback and `KEY_UNITS` trick mode * New cleaned up `rawaudioparse` and `rawvideoparse` elements that replace the   old `audioparse` and `videoparse` elements. There are compatibility element   factories registered with the old names to allow existing code to continue   to work. * The Decklink plugin gained support for 10 bit video SMPTE timecodes, and   generally got many bugfixes for various issues. * New API in `GstPlayer` for setting the multiview mode for stereoscopic   video, setting an HTTP/RTSP user agent and a time offset between audio and   video. In addition to that, there were various bugfixes and the new   gst-examples module contains Android, iOS, GTK+ and Qt example applications. * `GstBin` has new API for suppressing various `GstElement` or `GstObject`   flags that would otherwise be affected by added/removed child elements. This   new API allows `GstBin` subclasses to handle for themselves if they   should be considered a sink or source element, for example. * The `subparse` element can handle WebVTT streams now. * A new `sdpsrc` element was added that can read an SDP from a file, or get it   as a string as property and then sets up an RTP pipeline accordingly.  Plugin moves No plugins were moved this cycle. We'll make up for it next cycle, promise! Rewritten memory leak tracer GStreamer has had basic functionality to trace allocation and freeing of both mini-objects (buffers, events, caps, etc.) and objects in the form of the internal `GstAllocTrace` tracing system. This API was never exposed in the 1.x API series though. When requested, this would dump a list of objects and mini-objects at exit time which had still not been freed at that point, enabled with an environment variable. This subsystem has now been removed in favour of a new implementation based on the recently-added tracing framework.  Tracing hooks have been added to trace the creation and destruction of GstObjects and mini-objects, and a new tracer plugin has been written using those new hooks to track which objects are still live and which are not. If GStreamer has been compiled against the libunwind library, the new leaks tracer will remember where objects were allocated from as well. By default the leaks tracer will simply output a warning if leaks have been detected on `gst_deinit()`.  If the `GST_LEAKS_TRACER_SIG` environment variable is set, the leaks tracer will also handle the following UNIX signals:   * `SIGUSR1`: log alive objects * `SIGUSR2`: create a checkpoint and print a list of objects created and   destroyed since the previous checkpoint.   Unfortunately this will not work on Windows due to no signals, however.  If the `GST_LEAKS_TRACER_STACK_TRACE` environment variable is set, the leaks tracer will also log the creation stack trace of leaked objects. This may significantly increase memory consumption however.  New `MAY_BE_LEAKED` flags have been added to GstObject and GstMiniObject, so that objects and mini-objects that are likely to stay around forever can be flagged and blacklisted from the leak output.  To give the new leak tracer a spin, simply call any GStreamer application such as `gst-launch-1.0` or `gst-play-1.0` like this:  ``` GST_TRACERS=leaks gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num-buffers=10 ! fakesink  ```  If there are any leaks, a warning will be raised at the end.  It is also possible to trace only certain types of objects or mini-objects:  ``` GST_TRACERS="leaks(GstEvent,GstMessage)" gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num-buffers=10 ! fakesink  ```  This dedicated leaks tracer is much much faster than valgrind since all code is executed natively instead of being instrumented. This makes it very suitable for use on slow machines or embedded devices. It is however limited to certain types of leaks and won't catch memory leaks when the allocation has been made via plain old `malloc()` or `g_malloc()` or other means. It will also not trace non-GstObject GObjects.  The goal is to enable leak tracing on GStreamer's Continuous-Integration and testing system, both for the regular unit tests (make check) and media tests (gst-validate), so that accidental leaks in common code paths can be detected and fixed quickly.  For more information about the new tracer, check out Guillaume Desmottes's ["Tracking Memory Leaks"](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/tracking-memory-leaks/) talk or his [blog post](https://blog.desmottes.be/?post/2016/06/20/GStreamer-leaks-tracer) about the topic. GES and NLE changes  * Clip priorities are now handled by the layers, and the GESTimelineElement   priority property is now deprecated and unused * Enhanced (de)interlacing support to always use the `deinterlace` element   and expose needed properties to users * Allow reusing clips children after removing the clip from a layer * We are now testing many more rendering formats in the gst-validate   test suite, and failures have been fixed. * Also many bugs have been fixed in this cycle!  GStreamer validate changes This cycle has been focused on making GstValidate more than just a validating tool, but also a tool to help developers debug their GStreamer issues. When reporting issues, we try to gather as much information as possible and expose it to end users in a useful way. For an example of such enhancements, check out Thibault Saunier's [blog post](improving-debugging-gstreamer-validate) about the new Not Negotiated Error reporting mechanism.  Playbin3 support has been added so we can run validate tests with `playbin3` instead of playbin.  We are now able to properly communicate between `gst-validate-launcher` and launched subprocesses with actual IPC between them. That has enabled the test launcher to handle failing tests specifying the exact expected issue(s). gst-libav changes gst-libav uses the recently released ffmpeg 3.2 now, which brings a lot of improvements and bugfixes from the ffmpeg team in addition to various new codec mappings on the GStreamer side and quite a few bugfixes to the GStreamer integration to make it more robust. Build and DependenciesExperimental support for Meson as build systemOverview We have have added support for building GStreamer using the [Meson build system](http://mesonbuild.com/). This is currently experimental, but should work fine at least on Linux using the gcc or clang toolchains and on Windows using the MingW or MSVC toolchains.  Autotools remains the primary build system for the time being, but we hope to someday replace it and will steadily work towards that goal.  More information about the background and implications of all this and where we're hoping to go in future with this can be found in [Tim's mail](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/gstreamer-devel/2016-September/060231.html) to the gstreamer-devel mailing list.  For more information on Meson check out [these videos](http://mesonbuild.com/videos.html) and also the [Meson talk](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/gstreamer-development-on-windows-ans-faster-builds-everywhere-with-meson/) at the GStreamer Conference.  Immediate benefits for Linux users are faster builds and rebuilds. At the time of writing the Meson build of GStreamer is used by default in GNOME's jhbuild system.  The Meson build currently still lacks many of the fine-grained configuration options to enable/disable specific plugins. These will be added back in due course.  Note: The meson build files are not distributed in the source tarballs, you will need to get GStreamer from git if you want try it out. Windows Visual Studio toolchain support Windows users might appreciate being able to build GStreamer using the MSVC toolchain, which is not possible using autotools. This means that it will be possible to debug GStreamer and applications in Visual Studio, for example. We require VS2015 or newer for this at the moment.  There are two ways to build GStreamer using the MSVC toolchain:   1. Using the MSVC command-line tools (`cl.exe` etc.) via Meson's "ninja" backend. 2. Letting Meson's "vs2015" backend generate Visual Studio project files that    can be opened in Visual Studio and compiled from there.   This is currently only for adventurous souls though. All the bits are in place, but support for all of this has not been merged into GStreamer's cerbero build tool yet at the time of writing. This will hopefully happen in the next cycle, but for now this means that those wishing to compile GStreamer with MSVC will have to get their hands dirty.  There are also no binary SDK builds using the MSVC toolchain yet.  For more information on GStreamer builds using Meson and the Windows toolchain check out Nirbheek Chauhan's blog post ["Building and developing GStreamer using Visual Studio"](http://blog.nirbheek.in/2016/07/building-and-developing-gstreamer-using.html). Dependenciesgstreamer libunwind was added as an optional dependency. It is used only for debugging and tracing purposes.  The `opencv` plugin in gst-plugins-bad can now be built against OpenCV version 3.1, previously only 2.3-2.5 were supported. gst-plugins-ugly  * `mpeg2dec` now requires at least libmpeg2 0.5.1 (from 2008).  gst-plugins-bad  * `gltransformation` now requires at least graphene 1.4.0. * `lv2` now plugin requires at least lilv 0.16 instead of slv2.  Packaging notes Packagers please note that the `gst/gstconfig.h` public header file in the GStreamer core library moved back from being an architecture dependent include to being architecture independent, and thus it is no longer installed into `$(libdir)/gstreamer-1.0/include/gst` but into the normal include directory where it lives happily ever after with all the other public header files. The reason for this is that we now check whether the target supports unaligned memory access based on predefined compiler macros at compile time instead of checking it at configure time. Platform-specific improvementsAndroidNew universal binaries for all supported ABIs We now provide a "universal" tarball to allow building apps against all the architectures currently supported (x86, x86-64, armeabi, armeabi-v7a, armeabi-v8a). This is needed for building with recent versions of the Android NDK which defaults to building against all supported ABIs. Use [the Android player example](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-examples/commit/playback/player/android?id=a5cdde9119f038a1eb365aca20faa9741a38e788) as a reference for the required changes. Miscellaneous  * New `ahssrc` element that allows reading the hardware sensors, e.g. compass   or accelerometer.  macOS (OS/X) and iOS  * Support for querying available devices on OS/X via the GstDeviceProvider   API was added. * It is now possible to create OpenGL|ES 3.x contexts on iOS and use them in   combination with the VideoToolbox based decoder element. * many OpenGL/GLES improvements, see OpenGL section above  Windows  * gstconfig.h: Always use dllexport/import on Windows with MSVC * Miscellaneous fixes to make libs and plugins compile with the MVSC toolchain * MSVC toolchain support (see Meson section above for more details)  New Modules for Documentation, Examples, Meson Build Three new git modules have been added recently: gst-docs This is a new module where we will maintain documentation in the markdown format.  It contains the former gstreamer.com SDK tutorials which have kindly been made available by Fluendo under a Creative Commons license. The tutorials have been reviewed and updated for GStreamer 1.x and will be available as part of the [official GStreamer documentation](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/) going forward. The old gstreamer.com site will then be shut down with redirects pointing to the updated tutorials.  Some of the existing docbook XML-formatted documentation from the GStreamer core module such as the *Application Development Manual* and the *Plugin Writer's Guide* have been converted to markdown as well and will be maintained in the gst-docs module in future. They will be removed from the GStreamer core module in the next cycle.  This is just the beginning. Our goal is to provide a more cohesive documentation experience for our users going forward, and easier to create and maintain documentation for developers. There is a lot more work to do, get in touch if you want to help out.  If you encounter any problems or spot any omissions or outdated content in the new documentation, please [file a bug in bugzilla](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GStreamer&component=documentation) to let us know.  We will probably release gst-docs as a separate tarball for distributions to package in the next cycle. gst-examples A new [module](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-examples/tree/) has been added for examples. It does not contain much yet, currently it only contains a small [http-launch](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-examples/tree/network/http-launch/) utility that serves a pipeline over http as well as various [GstPlayer playback frontends](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-examples/tree/playback/player) for Android, iOS, Gtk+ and Qt.  More examples will be added over time. The examples in this repository should be more useful and more substantial than most of the examples we ship as part of our other modules, and also written in a way that makes them good example code. If you have ideas for examples, let us know.  No decision has been made yet if this module will be released and/or packaged. It probably makes sense to do so though. gst-build [gst-build](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-build/tree/) is a new meta module to build GStreamer using the new Meson build system. This module is not required to build GStreamer with Meson, it is merely for convenience and aims to provide a development setup similar to the existing `gst-uninstalled` setup.  gst-build makes use of Meson's [subproject feature](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/wiki/Subprojects) and sets up the various GStreamer modules as subprojects, so they can all be updated and built in parallel.  This module is still very new and highly experimental. It should work at least on Linux and Windows (OS/X needs some build fixes). Let us know of any issues you encounter by popping into the `#gstreamer` IRC channel or by [filing a bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GStreamer&component=gst-build).  This module will probably not be released or packaged (does not really make sense). Contributors Aaron Boxer, Aleix Conchillo FlaquÃ©, Alessandro Decina, Alexandru BÄluÈ, Alex Ashley, Alex-P.

Bugs fixed in 1.10 More than [750 bugs](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&classification=Platform&limit=0&list_id=164074&order=bug_id&product=GStreamer&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&target_milestone=1.8.1&target_milestone=1.8.2&target_milestone=1.8.3&target_milestone=1.8.4&target_milestone=1.9.1&target_milestone=1.9.2&target_milestone=1.9.90&target_milestone=1.10.0) have been fixed during the development of 1.10.  This list does not include issues that have been cherry-picked into the stable 1.8 branch and fixed there as well, all fixes that ended up in the 1.8 branch are also included in 1.10.  This list also does not include issues that have been fixed without a bug report in bugzilla, so the actual number of fixes is much higher. Stable 1.10 branch After the 1.10.0 release there will be several 1.10.x bug-fix releases which will contain bug fixes which have been deemed suitable for a stable branch, but no new features or intrusive changes will be added to a bug-fix release usually. The 1.10.x bug-fix releases will be made from the git 1.10 branch, which is a stable branch. 1.10.0 1.10.0 was released on 1st November 2016.   1.10.1 The first 1.10 bug-fix release (1.10.1) was released on 17 November 2016. This release only contains bugfixes and it should be safe to update from 1.10.x. Major bugfixes in 1.10.1  * Security-relevant bugfix in the vmnc decoder (CVE-2016-9445, CVE-2016-9446) * Various bugfixes to playbin3/decodebin3 * Fix error at the end of playing any WAV file * Fix usability of androidmedia plugin if the camera or sensor API is not   available, but codecs are * Handle redirections on PLAY, and missing control attribute in the RTSP source * Various OpenGL related bugfixes * ... and many, many more!

Note that this is not the full list of changes. For the full list of changes please refer to the GIT logs or ChangeLogs of the particular modules.   1.10.2 The second 1.10 bug-fix release (1.10.2) was released on 29 November 2016. This release only contains bugfixes and it should be safe to update from 1.10.x. Major bugfixes in 1.10.2  * Security-relevant bugfix in the FLI/FLX/FLC decoder (CVE-2016-9634,   CVE-2016-9635, CVE-2016-9636) * Various fixes for crashes, assertions and other failures on fuzzed input   files. Among others, thanks to Hanno BÃ¶ck for testing and reporting   (CVE-2016-9807, CVE-2016-9808, CVE-2016-9809, CVE-2016-9810, CVE-2016-9811,   CVE-2016-9812, CVE-2016-9813). * SAVP/SAVPF profile in gst-rtsp-server works for live streams again, and the   correct MIKEY policy message is generated * Further OpenGL related bugfixes * gst-libav was updated to ffmpeg 3.2.1 * ... and many, many more!

[Bug #766366](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766366) * Code signing for Apple platforms has some problems currently, requiring   manual work to get your application signed. [Bug #771860](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771860) * Building applications with Android NDK r13 on Windows does not work.

[Bug #772842](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=772842)  Schedule for 1.12 Our next major feature release will be 1.12, and 1.11 will be the unstable development version leading up to the stable 1.12 release. The development of 1.11/1.12 will happen in the git master branch.  The plan for the 1.12 development cycle is yet to be confirmed, but it is expected that feature freeze will be around early/mid-February, followed by several 1.11 pre-releases and the new 1.12 stable release in April.  1.12 will be backwards-compatible to the stable 1.10, 1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.0 release series.   ---   *These release notes have been prepared by Olivier CrÃªte, Sebastian DrÃ¶ge, Nicolas Dufresne, Edward Hervey, VÃ­ctor Manuel JÃ¡quez Leal, Tim-Philipp MÃ¼ller, Reynaldo H.
