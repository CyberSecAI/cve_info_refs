{
  "CVE-2017-5418": {
    "Description": "An out of bounds read error occurs when parsing some HTTP digest authorization responses, resulting in information leakage through the reading of random memory containing matches to specifically set patterns.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `nsHttpDigestAuth::ParseChallenge` method in `netwerk\\protocol\\http\\nsHttpDigestAuth.cpp` assumes that the challenge string starts with \"Digest \" (7 characters). When the server sends a header such as `WWW-Authenticate:Digest` (no space after `Digest`), adding 7 to the challenge pointer results in an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Information leakage through reading of random memory that might contain sensitive information matching specific patterns. The vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of data present in the memory.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "A malicious server can send a specially crafted `WWW-Authenticate` header, specifically without a space after the `Digest` keyword, to trigger the out-of-bounds read."
     ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control a server that the victim connects to and can send HTTP responses with manipulated `WWW-Authenticate` headers."
