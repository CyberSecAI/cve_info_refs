{
  "CVE-2017-5840": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds heap read vulnerability exists in the qtdemux_parse_samples function within the qtdemux element of the GStreamer framework. This can be triggered by a specially crafted file. ",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises due to an incorrect index being used when reading sample data, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds heap read during parsing. Specifically, the code does not correctly increment the stts index, potentially reading more chunks than available.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash applications that use the affected GStreamer components, which can lead to a denial of service or, potentially, execution of arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user or automated system to open a specially crafted file using an application utilizing the affected GStreamer components.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted media file that triggers the vulnerability. No other special capabilities are required."
