The provided content is related to CVE-2017-5198.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is incorrect permissions on management scripts within SolarWinds LEM (Log & Event Manager).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the fact that several scripts, which are allowed to be executed as sudo, have incorrect permissions. This allows a user to modify the scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root.
- Complete machine compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must first exploit CVE-2017-5199 to gain access to a bash shell.
- Once in the bash shell, the attacker can edit the vulnerable scripts.
- The attacker can use `sudo` to execute the modified scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to log in through the custom SSH interface.
- The attacker must successfully execute a jailbreak by exploiting CVE-2017-5199 to obtain a bash shell.
