 Guidelines:
1. First verify if the content relates to the CVE specified based on the official description
2. If the content does not relate to this CVE, respond with "UNRELATED"
3. If no useful vulnerability information is found, respond with "NOINFO" 
4. For relevant content, extract:
   - Root cause of vulnerability
   - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
   - Impact of exploitation
   - Attack vectors
   - Required attacker capabilities/position

{
  "CVE-2017-5839": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "An infinite recursion in `gst_riff_create_audio_caps` function due to incorrect handling of nested WAVEFORMATEX structures.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow due to an endless recursive call in `gst_riff_create_audio_caps` function. A guint32 value is implicitly casted to guint16 when recursing, skipping a check which leads to recursion.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Stack overflow leading to denial of service or potential arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malformed media file containing nested WAVEFORMATEX structures. The vulnerability is triggered when GStreamer attempts to parse the file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create or modify a media file to contain the malicious nested WAVEFORMATEX structures."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code did not correctly check for nested WAVEFORMATEX structures within a RIFF file, leading to infinite recursion.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An implicit cast from guint32 to guint16 bypassed a check meant to prevent recursion, leading to a stack overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to stack overflow.",
      "Attack vectors": "Processing a crafted RIFF file.",
           "Required attacker capabilities/position":"The attacker needs to provide the crafted file to a user that opens it using GStreamer."
    },
    {
          "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect check for nested WAVEFORMATEX structures in `gst_riff_create_audio_caps` function.  A guint32 value was incorrectly used as a guint16 during a recursive call.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow due to an infinite recursion in the parsing of a malformed RIFF audio file. The issue is due to incorrect handling of nested WAVEFORMATEX structures within a RIFF file.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to a stack overflow. Potential for arbitrary code execution may also be possible.",
       "Attack vectors": "A crafted RIFF file with nested WAVEFORMATEX structures can trigger the stack overflow during parsing.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide the crafted file which GStreamer will then parse. No special privileges are needed."
