The provided content is related to CVE-2017-5165.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application of the BINOM3 Electric Power Quality Meter does not generate a CSRF token per page or sensitive function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of CSRF token generation.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to silently execute unauthorized actions on the device, such as modifying configuration parameters and saving the modified configuration. This can result in unauthorized functional configuration and data changes.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring a low level of effort to exploit (AC:L).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need prior privileges on the system (PR:N), but does require the victim to perform a user interaction (UI:R) such as clicking a link, in order to complete the exploit.
