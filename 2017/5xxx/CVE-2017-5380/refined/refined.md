Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-5380:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of this vulnerability is a potential use-after-free error that occurs during DOM manipulation, specifically when handling SVG content. The issue is triggered by a specific sequence of operations involving creation and removal of elements within the DOM tree.
- More specifically, the vulnerability occurs in `nsFrameSelection::MoveCaret`, which is called by `mozilla::dom::Selection::Modify`. During the manipulation of the DOM and the subsequent call to  `mozilla::PresShell::FlushPendingNotifications()`, a freed memory region can be accessed again, resulting in a heap-use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The core weakness lies in the use of a memory address after it has been freed, leading to memory corruption.
- Insecure DOM manipulation: The way SVG content is being manipulated, specifically when removing and adding nodes, and the subsequent interaction with the selection API, causes this use-after-free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of this use-after-free can lead to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service. Although, according to the Mozilla bug report and comments from Red Hat, an RCE may not be easily achieved.
-  The primary impact is a potentially exploitable crash due to a heap-use-after-free.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious website with crafted SVG content that manipulates the DOM. The exploit requires specific conditions to be met, including a precise sequence of DOM element creation, manipulation, and deletion. This can be achieved through Javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker needs to be able to host a webpage with malicious SVG content or trick a user into visiting a specially crafted web page, or have a malicious email that will load the malicious content.
-   The attacker would need to have a good understanding of the DOM and how to trigger the specific sequence of events to cause the use-after-free. They would need to understand the relevant source code.
-   No special privileges or direct access to the user's system is required, as the attack occurs within the browser's environment.
