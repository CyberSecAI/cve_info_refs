{
  "CVE-2017-5378": {
    "description": "Hashed codes of JavaScript objects are shared between pages. This allows for pointer leaks because an object’s address can be discovered through hash codes, and also allows for data leakage of an object’s content using these hash codes.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how JavaScript objects' hash codes are generated and shared across different pages or contexts. These hash codes are based on memory addresses, which allows attackers to leak pointer data and object content information.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of memory addresses as a basis for hash code generation.",
      "Sharing of generated hash codes across different contexts."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can obtain leaked memory addresses and content of JavaScript objects that are shared across different pages. This can be used for a variety of purposes, including bypassing ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and privilege escalation within affected extensions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "WebExtension scripts.",
      "Cross-origin frames using Map/Set."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute JavaScript code in a web context. No special privileges needed other than being able to load a webpage or execute script within an extension."
