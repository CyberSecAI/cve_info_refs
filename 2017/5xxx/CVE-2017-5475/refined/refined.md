The content is related to CVE-2017-5475.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the comment deletion functionality of Serendipity. Specifically, the `serendipity_deleteComment` function called via `comment.php` does not validate a CSRF token.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The main vulnerability is the absence of a CSRF token, which makes the comment deletion functionality susceptible to CSRF attacks.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete comments on a Serendipity blog without the user's explicit consent or knowledge. A successful CSRF attack can result in loss of data (comments) or the manipulation of the blog content.

Attack vectors:
An attacker could craft a malicious HTML page or link that, when accessed by an authenticated user, triggers a request to `comment.php` to delete a comment. The user's browser will send the request with the user's authentication cookies, thus leading to unauthorized comment deletion without the user's knowledge.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to trick an authenticated Serendipity user into visiting a malicious page or clicking on a malicious link to trigger a comment deletion. The attacker must also know or guess the ID of the comment to be deleted.
