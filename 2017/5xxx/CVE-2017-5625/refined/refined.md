- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The bootloader's fastboot interface allows security-sensitive operations to be run even when the bootloader is locked, specifically the `fastboot oem dump <partition>` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `fastboot oem dump` command bypasses the locked bootloader restrictions, enabling unauthorized partition dumping.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A physical attacker or malware with ADB/fastboot access can partially dump the contents of any partition (except `keystore`). This can expose sensitive data if other vulnerabilities are found to leak the AES master key and decrypt the dumped data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires physical access to the device or the ability to execute commands via ADB/fastboot. This can be achieved by a malicious charger, PC malware, or an attacker with physical access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Physical access to the device or ability to connect via USB with ADB/fastboot
    - Ability to issue fastboot commands.
