Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability in the `emulated_apdu_from_guest` function within the CCID card device emulator support in QEMU. This occurs when processing command/response packets between the guest and the host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling the size of Application Protocol Data Units (APDU) exchanged with the host through the CCID emulator.
*  Specifically, this flaw can be triggered while copying data from the guest to the host in the `usb/dev-smartcard-reader.c` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the QEMU process on the host machine. A malicious guest user could send a specially crafted sequence of APDU packets that triggers the integer overflow, causing the QEMU process to terminate abruptly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest OS Privileges:** The attack vector requires a privileged user or process within the guest operating system.
*   **CCID Card Device Emulator:** The specific attack vector involves sending malformed messages using the CCID Card device emulator. This implies that the virtual machine needs to have this device or emulation enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs privileged access within a guest operating system running on the vulnerable QEMU instance.
*   **Ability to Interact with the CCID Device Emulator:** The attacker must be able to interact with the emulated CCID card reader to send specially crafted APDU packets.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was found in the `usb/dev-smartcard-reader.c` file, within the `emulated_apdu_from_guest` function.
*  The vulnerability is triggered by an improper handling of APDU message lengths, leading to an integer overflow which can then lead to a crash of the QEMU process when certain conditions are met.
