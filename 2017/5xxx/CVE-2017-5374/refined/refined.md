  "CVE-2017-5374": {
    "description": "Mozilla developers and community members Gary Kwong, Olli Pettay, Tooru Fujisawa, Carsten Book, Andrew McCreight, Chris Pearce, Ronald Crane, Jan de Mooij, Julian Seward, Nicolas Pierron, Randell Jesup, Esther Monchari, Honza Bambas, and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "Multiple memory safety bugs were found in Firefox 50.1.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Potential arbitrary code execution",
     "attack_vectors": "Exploitation of memory safety bugs.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Exploitation of memory corruption bugs through crafted inputs or malicious websites.",
   "more_information": "This CVE is a general listing for multiple memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 51, with specific bugs listed in the provided links."
  },
   "CVE-2017-5388": {
    "description": "A STUN server in conjunction with a large number of `webkitRTCPeerConnection` objects can be used to send large STUN packets in a short period of time due to a lack of rate limiting being applied on e10s systems, allowing for a denial of service attack.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of rate limiting on STUN packet generation in e10s systems when using WebRTC.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service through excessive UDP traffic.",
     "attack_vectors": "Malicious website or application that creates many WebRTC peer connections and sends STUN packets to a target server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to control the webpage/application and set up STUN server and peer connections.",
     "more_information": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause the browser to saturate the upstream connection by sending excessive UDP traffic, by creating a large number of WebRTC peer connections. This is due to the rate limit not being applied to the e10s (Electrolysis) system. The fix was to apply the rate limit to the e10s system"
