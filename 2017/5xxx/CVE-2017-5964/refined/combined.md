## Description

[![@bestshow](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5211744?v=4&size=48)](/bestshow)[bestshow](https://github.com/bestshow)opened [on Feb 11, 2017](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/issues/636#issue-206993988)

Procuct: Emoncms 9

Vunlerable Version: 9 and probably prior

Tested Version: 9

Author: ADLab of Venustech

Advisory Details:

I have discovered multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Emoncms 9, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficientfiltration of user-supplied data in multiple HTTP GET parameters passed to "emoncms-master/Modules/vis/visualisations/compare.php" url. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation examples below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a pop-up messagebox:

(1)

<http://localhost/teststh/emoncms-master/emoncms-master/Modules/vis/visualisations/compare.php?feedA=%22%22;%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3E>

(2)

<http://localhost/teststh/emoncms-master/emoncms-master/Modules/vis/visualisations/compare.php?feedB=%22%22;%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3E>
