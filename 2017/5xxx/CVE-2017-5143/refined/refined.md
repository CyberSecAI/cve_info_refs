**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation when handling file paths, allowing a path traversal attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23)

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a directory traversal attack without authentication. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive files and potential modification of the system depending on access controls, resulting in a compromise of confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specific URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
