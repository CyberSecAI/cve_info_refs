Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from firmware issues within the Intel® Puma™ 5, 6, and 7 Series chipsets. Specifically, the firmware is susceptible to resource depletion or timeout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Resource depletion: The firmware can be forced to exhaust its resources.
- Timeout: The firmware can be made to enter a timeout state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful attack results in a denial of service, rendering the affected devices unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network attacks: Exploitation occurs through crafted network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send crafted network traffic to the vulnerable device.
- No special privileges required: The attacker does not require authentication or special privileges (PR:N).
- No user interaction needed: The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).
