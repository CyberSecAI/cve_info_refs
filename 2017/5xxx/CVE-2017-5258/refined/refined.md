{
  "CVE-2017-5258": {
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when using SNMP to upload a device configuration.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a logged-in user's browser by injecting malicious scripts through a crafted configuration file. This can lead to session hijacking and full administrative control of the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "SNMP configuration upload",
        "Man-in-the-middle on the local network to obtain SNMP community strings"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Knowledge or guessing of the SNMP RW (read/write) community string",
      "Ability to host a malicious configuration file via HTTP"
    ],
        "additional_information": "The vulnerable OIDs are cambiumJSONCfgImport, cambiumJSONCfgImportError, and cambiumJSONCfgImportStatus. The attacker provides a URL to a malicious configuration file, which the device downloads and applies, injecting malicious XSS code.  This is similar to 'R7-2017-25.4' but using config upload instead of individual OID writes."
