Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5487:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2017-5487. It describes a vulnerability in the WordPress REST API that exposes user data.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The WordPress REST API, by default, exposed user data for *all* users who had authored a post of a public post type. This was due to a lack of access control on the API endpoint.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of user data through the REST API. This included usernames (slugs) and user IDs, as demonstrated in the provided exploit script.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that the REST API endpoint did not properly restrict access to user data, allowing anyone to query it and obtain information about all users.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **User Enumeration:** An attacker could enumerate all users of a WordPress site by simply accessing the vulnerable REST API endpoint. This information could then be used in further attacks, such as brute-forcing passwords or targeted phishing attacks.
- **Privacy Violation:** The exposure of user data constitutes a privacy violation.
- **Reconnaissance:** The user information could be used for reconnaissance purposes in preparation for more sophisticated attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers could directly send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoint (`/wp-json/wp/v2/users/`) to retrieve the user data. This endpoint is publicly accessible.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the target WordPress site.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability; the endpoint is publicly accessible.
- **Basic Technical Skills:** Only basic technical skills are needed to make the HTTP requests required to exploit this vulnerability. The provided php exploit shows how to access the API using `file_get_contents` and parse the response.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix involved limiting the exposed user data in the REST API to only post types that have explicitly specified that they should be shown within the REST API. This change was introduced in WordPress 4.7.1.
- The provided exploit script demonstrates how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability before the fix was applied.
- The vulnerability was reported by Krogsgard and Chris Jean.

In summary, CVE-2017-5487 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the WordPress REST API that allows attackers to enumerate users of a site, without any authentication.
