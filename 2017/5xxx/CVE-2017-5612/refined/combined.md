# Version 4.7.2

[↑ Back to top](#wp--skip-link--target)

From the [WordPress 4.7.2 release post](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/01/wordpress-4-7-2-security-release/): WordPress versions 4.7.1 and earlier are affected by three security issues:

1. The user interface for assigning taxonomy terms in Press This is shown to users who do not have permissions to use it. Reported by David Herrera of [Alley Interactive](https://www.alleyinteractive.com/).
2. `WP_Query` is vulnerable to a SQL injection (SQLi) when passing unsafe data. WordPress core is not directly vulnerable to this issue, but we’ve added hardening to prevent plugins and themes from accidentally causing a vulnerability. Reported by [Mo Jangda](https://github.com/mjangda)(batmoo).
3. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the posts list table. Reported by [Ian Dunn](https://iandunn.name/) of the WordPress Security Team.

From the [additional 4.7.2 security disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/01/disclosure-of-additional-security-fix-in-wordpress-4-7-2/), WordPress versions 4.7.0 and 4.7.1 are affected by the following security issue:

1. There was an *Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in a REST API Endpoint*. Previous versions of WordPress, even with the REST API Plugin, were never vulnerable to this. Reported by [Marc-Alexandre Montpas](https://twitter.com/MarcS0h) of [Sucuri](https://sucuri.net/).

                 CVE-2017-5612
Debian Bug     : 851310 852767

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They would allow remote attackers to hijack victims'
credentials, access sensitive information, execute arbitrary commands,
bypass read and post restrictions, or mount denial-of-service attacks.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u12.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 4.7.1+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

# WordPress 4.7.2 Security Release

---

WordPress 4.7.2 is now available. This is a **security release** for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

WordPress versions 4.7.1 and earlier are affected by three security issues:

1. The user interface for assigning taxonomy terms in Press This is shown to users who do not have permissions to use it. Reported by David Herrera of [Alley Interactive](https://www.alleyinteractive.com/).
2. `WP_Query` is vulnerable to a SQL injection (SQLi) when passing unsafe data. WordPress core is not directly vulnerable to this issue, but we’ve added hardening to prevent plugins and themes from accidentally causing a vulnerability. Reported by [Mo Jangda](https://github.com/mjangda) (batmoo).
3. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the posts list table. Reported by [Ian Dunn](https://iandunn.name/) of the WordPress Security Team.
4. An unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in a REST API endpoint. Reported by [Marc-Alexandre Montpas](https://twitter.com/MarcS0h) of Sucuri Security. \*

Thank you to the reporters of these issues for practicing [responsible disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/).

[Download WordPress 4.7.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.7.2.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.7.2.

\* Update: An additional serious vulnerability was fixed in this release and public disclosure was delayed. For more information on this vulnerability, additional mitigation steps taken, and an explanation for why disclosure was delayed, please read [Disclosure of Additional Security Fix in WordPress 4.7.2](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/01/disclosure-of-additional-security-fix-in-wordpress-4-7-2/).
