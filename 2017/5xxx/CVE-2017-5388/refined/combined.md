| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

Mozilla developers and community members Gary Kwong, Olli Pettay, Tooru Fujisawa, Carsten Book, Andrew McCreight, Chris Pearce, Ronald Crane, Jan de Mooij, Julian Seward, Nicolas Pierron, Randell Jesup, Esther Monchari, Honza Bambas, and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Jan de Mooij, Tom Schuster, and Oriol reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0
Build ID: 20160802213348
Steps to reproduce:
The issue exists because a <track> tag's onerror event is triggered twice if the file referenced in it's src attribute doesn't exist, while it's only triggered once if the file exists but not playable.
Please check the attached file for a PoC. Change the path to the file in the src attribute in the <track> tag for the different behaviors explained.
Actual results:
The onerror event for the <track> tag is fired twice if the file doesn't exist and once if it does.
Expected results:
The onerror event should be fired the same number of times for both cases.

This works as a local attack only--that is, when the PoC is itself loaded from a file:/// url. From a web page you always get a "doesn't exist" result because there's a security error thrown:

Excuse me, but why is this case considered sec-low, while the bug described here <http://leucosite.com/FireFox-Check-If-Local-File-Folder-Exists-Using-Jar-URI-Scheme/> is about the same class of issues, and even the POC itself has to be loaded via the file:// protocol, yet it was considered sec-moderate and was even rewarded a bounty ?

1. Create a large number of webkitRTCPeerConnection objects
2. Point the STUN server for ICE at the a the target to DDOS
3. Set them up with to start gathering stun address
A STUN packet is sent every 1 ms. This allows an attacker doing perhaps an add buy and using to have each browser display the add send about 500 kbps of UDP traffic to an IP and port of the attackers choosing and might contribute to a DDOS attack on say DNS servers.
Currently plan to talk about this at upcoming IETF which has a a draft deadline of July 8 but am happy to work with FF team to change that timing if needed. I am strongly committed to what is good for the WebRTC community do not want to do anything that would have any negative impact on FF.

Phew, good thing we don't implement webkitRTCPeerConnection. I managed to get 3.5Mbps out of Firefox when I did this last.
Byron, we should be limiting to 8k bytes per second (64 kbps) [1], per content process (worth fixing? probably not). Does Cullen's report sound correct? Or did we neglect to rate limit gathering checks when we added the rate limit in [bug 906384](/show_bug.cgi?id=906384 "RESOLVED FIXED - ICE pacing needs to be global")?

STUN requests for gathering are rate limited just like ICE checks are. The problem is this rate limit does not apply for e10s. I doubt it makes sense to try to make the rate limit apply across all content processes right now, although if/when we start using more than one we might want to look into moving the rate limit into the parent process somehow.Flags: needinfo?(docfaraday)

Byron - How much work would it be to implement/fix the limit in e10s? (ignoring the per-content-process thing, which I don't think I care about much if at all even if we turn on multiple content processes).
I think we do want to fix this very soon given the plans to ship e10s to production; and if the fix is simple enough uplift to Aurora.Assignee: nobody → docfaradayRank: 15Flags: needinfo?(docfaraday)Priority: -- → P1

Tracking for 49, while it's sec-low it sounds like it would be nice to fix in 49. We could still take a patch in beta. Byron are you able to take a look?

In e10s case this is not going to be called on STS. Is that a problem?

Hmm. I think in the e10s case, this code will be called only from one thread, on the content process. So I think we're ok, although the comment should probably be corrected.

Actually, it is called from STS in both cases, just different processes. So we should be good.

It is a pretty low-impact bug, to be honest. I could be convinced otherwise.Flags: needinfo?(docfaraday)

It's mostly low-impact (and hard for people to find!), but it's also quite low-risk (mostly just encapsulating a bit of code in a function, and calling it from one additional place).
Should go for at least 51, and 52 seems reasonable. I might rate it higher than low, since e10s is on by default. Not crit, but medium at least; perhaps high.Flags: needinfo?(rjesup) → needinfo?(docfaraday)

Extend STUN rate limit to e10s sockets
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]:
Present since webrtc landed.
[User impact if declined]:
Content will be able to cause the browser to saturate the upstream at an arbitrary IP:port over UDP.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
None.
[Risks and why]:
Pretty low. Just moving some code around, and calling it in one additional place.
[String/UUID change made/needed]:
None.Flags: needinfo?(docfaraday)
