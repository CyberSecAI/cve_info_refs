Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5388:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of rate limiting on STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) packets when using WebRTC in conjunction with multiple `webkitRTCPeerConnection` objects on e10s (Electrolysis) systems.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient rate limiting:  The existing rate limit for STUN requests was not being applied correctly when using e10s, allowing an excessive number of STUN packets to be sent.
- WebRTC and STUN interaction: Attackers can exploit the WebRTC implementation, specifically with how STUN servers are used for ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment), to generate a large volume of UDP traffic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to generate a large amount of UDP traffic in a short period of time, potentially overwhelming a target system or network.
- DDOS amplification: An attacker could potentially use a network of browsers to generate significant traffic toward a target.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious web page: The attacker crafts a web page with malicious JavaScript code that creates a large number of `webkitRTCPeerConnection` objects.
- STUN server manipulation: The attacker sets the STUN server for ICE to the IP address of the target they wish to attack.
- Browser exploitation:  Users visiting the malicious page would unintentionally participate in the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host a webpage: The attacker needs the ability to host a web page containing malicious Javascript.
- Knowledge of WebRTC: The attacker needs a knowledge of how to create and manipulate `webkitRTCPeerConnection` objects in WebRTC.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to e10s (multi-process) Firefox, as the rate limiting was not being correctly applied in this context.
- The bug report mentions a plan to discuss the issue at the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), indicating a desire for community involvement.
- The fix involves extending the existing STUN rate limiting to apply to e10s sockets.
- The vulnerability is classified as "sec-low" which suggests the impact was considered less severe than other security issues fixed in the same release.
