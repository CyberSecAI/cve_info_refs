- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The platform sample code firmware for certain Intel processors potentially exposes password information in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure handling of BIOS and AMT passwords. Passwords are not properly protected in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure, allowing a local attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive password information.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
