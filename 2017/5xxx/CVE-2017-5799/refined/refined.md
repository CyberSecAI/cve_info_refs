{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in multiple components, leading to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in multiple parameters of different components like Application Content Manager, Platform Administration Tool, VoiceXML Administration Tool.",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in VoiceXML Administration Tool's proxylink.do function."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript to be executed in the context of the victim's browser (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement. Combined with RFI, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending crafted POST requests to /mcm/resources/ with malicious JavaScript in the 'description' parameter.",
      "Sending GET requests to /om/call.do with malicious JavaScript in the 'type' parameter.",
      "Sending GET requests to /om/event.do with malicious JavaScript in the 'type' parameter.",
      "Sending GET requests to /om/proxylink.do with malicious URLs in the 'url' parameter.",
      "Sending crafted GET requests to /OCMPOAM/cdrdispatch with malicious javascript in the 'cmd', 'next', and 'sessionType' parameters",
    "Sending crafted GET requests to /OCMPOAM/BMPFFaultMgr.chailet with malicious Javascript in multiple parameters including 'LEV_TYPE0', 'LEV_TYPE1', 'LEV_TYPE2', 'LEV_TYPE3', 'LEV_NAME0', 'LEV_NAME1', 'LEV_NAME2', 'LEV_NAME3', 'GetMapAction', 'LEV_NUM', 'NAME'."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned as being required for exploitation, but the admin interface may require authentication"
