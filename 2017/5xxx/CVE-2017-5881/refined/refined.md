```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Heap corruption due to a malformed .fpx file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap overflow/corruption. When processing a specially crafted .fpx file, the application attempts to free a heap chunk with a corrupted size value leading to a crash.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of Service (DoS). The application crashes and becomes unusable.
- Attack vectors: Opening a specially crafted .fpx file with GOM Player. This can be achieved by tricking a user into opening the file locally or via a web server using the "CTRL+U" feature.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to create a malformed .fpx file and have a victim open it with the vulnerable version of GOM Player.
