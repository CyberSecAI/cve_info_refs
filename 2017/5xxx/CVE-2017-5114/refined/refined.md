Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5114:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a "memory lifecycle issue" within the PDFium component of the Chromium browser. This indicates a problem with how memory is managed during the lifecycle of objects or data structures within PDFium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Lifecycle Issue:** The core problem is improper management of memory, specifically within the PDFium library. This could involve issues such as double frees, use-after-free scenarios, or memory leaks, potentially leading to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Chromium browser process. This is the most severe impact.
*   **Crash:** The vulnerability could lead to a crash of the Chromium browser, causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated, memory corruption issues like this can sometimes lead to the disclosure of sensitive information if an attacker can read memory locations where sensitive data is stored.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Content:** The attack vector involves the processing of "malformed web content". This indicates that an attacker could trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF or embedding it within a web page, designed to exploit the memory lifecycle issue in PDFium when a user visits the page.
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not require physical access to the target system.
*   **Crafted Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to create or inject specially crafted PDF content (or embed it within a webpage) to trigger the memory lifecycle issue.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim needs to open or load the malicious content using a vulnerable version of Chromium.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Upstream Bug:** The upstream bug report for this issue can be found at: `<https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=752829>`
*   **Reported By:** The vulnerability was reported by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
*   **Fix:** The issue was resolved in Chrome version 61.0.3163.79.
*   **Red Hat Fix:**  Red Hat addressed this in RHSA-2017:2676.
*   **Gentoo Fix:** Gentoo addressed this in GLSA 201709-15.
*   **Debian Fix:** Debian addressed this in DSA 3985-1.

In summary, CVE-2017-5114 involves a memory management flaw in the PDFium component of Chromium, which could be exploited by a remote attacker through crafted web content, leading to arbitrary code execution, a crash, or sensitive information disclosure.
