- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a charger is connected to a powered off OnePlus 3/3T device, the Android Debug Bridge daemon (`adbd`) starts with ADB authorization disabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `adbd` service is started without requiring authorization, allowing any connected device to establish an ADB session.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device via ADB, allowing for further exploitation, information exfiltration, or modification of the device, including the ability to reboot into the bootloader to perform fastboot related attacks. This access could lead to root shell access, putting SELinux in permissive mode, executing kernel code, and replacing the system partition.
- **Attack vectors:** Connecting a malicious charger to a powered-off vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Physical access to the device with a malicious charger.
