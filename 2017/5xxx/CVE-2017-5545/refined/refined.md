Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `main` function of `plistutil.c`. The `plistutil` tool performs a `memcmp` operation using a heap buffer without properly checking the size of the input file. If the input file size is less than 8 bytes, the tool attempts to read beyond the bounds of the allocated heap buffer, leading to a heap out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based out-of-bounds read. The code reads memory beyond the allocated buffer when processing a small plist file.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code does not adequately validate the input file size before performing the `memcmp` operation. This allows an attacker to provide a small file that will cause the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from process memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted input file with a size smaller than 8 bytes to the `plistutil` tool.
- This can be achieved through a local file or possibly remotely depending on the context in which `plistutil` is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `plistutil` application.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges as the vulnerability exists within the application itself when processing the input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability (commit `7391a506352c009fe044dead7baad9e22dd279ee`) introduces a check to ensure the file size is at least 8 bytes, preventing the out-of-bounds read.
- The issue was reported as a heap-buffer-overflow by a user "zhunki" on GitHub (issue #87).
- The vulnerability was addressed in Debian via a security update (DLA 2168-1).
