Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `fm_selected[]` parameter within the `b2evolution/inc/files/files.ctrl.php` file. This parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the `fm_selected[]` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files and directories outside the intended file root.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete files on the server that the webserver user has access to.
- **File Existence Check:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to determine if a file exists on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious request with the `fm_selected[]` parameter containing directory traversal sequences. This would typically be an HTTP GET or POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application. No authentication requirements were mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit message "Fixed fm_selected parameter exploit" and the associated code diff shows the fix was implemented by adding a check for directory traversal sequences (../) in the fm_selected parameter value.
- The issue report indicates the vulnerability was found in version 6.8.3-stable.
