- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses `unserialize()` on user-supplied data from the `$_COOKIE['salt']` without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection. The vulnerability lies in the use of `unserialize()` on user-controlled data, specifically the `salt` cookie.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject a serialized PHP object into the `salt` cookie, which when unserialized by the server, could lead to arbitrary code execution by triggering `__wakeup()` and `__destruct()` methods of the injected object.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can set the vulnerable cookie, likely through a login request, and upon the server processing of the cookie through `unserialize()`, the vulnerability can be triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server with a crafted `salt` cookie containing a serialized PHP object.
