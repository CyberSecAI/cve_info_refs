Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an assertion failure within the `zzip_entry_findfirst` function in `fseeko.c` of the zziplib library.
- Specifically, the assertion `0 <= root && root < mapsize` fails. This suggests an issue related to out-of-bounds access when accessing the zip archive map.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Assertion failure: A malformed zip archive can cause an assertion failure due to a problematic root value.
- The vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer access, causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability causes a crash when processing a malformed archive, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted zip archive is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed zip archive to a program or system using the vulnerable `zziplib` library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered via fuzzing using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The reproducer is available at: `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00161-zziplib-assertionfailure-seeko_C`
- The issue was initially discovered on 2017-01-17 and a blog post was made about it on 2017-02-09.
- CVE-2017-5981 was assigned on 2017-02-13.
