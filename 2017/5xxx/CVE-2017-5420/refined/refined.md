Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5420:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The content directly references CVE-2017-5420 in the bug report for Bug 1284395, with the alias `CVE-2017-5420`. This confirms that the content is directly related to the CVE.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability arises from how `javascript:` URLs are handled, particularly when opened in a new tab or window through middle-clicks or similar actions. When a `javascript:` URL is opened this way:
      1. It loads in the new tab.
      2. A subsequent  `location.reload()` call made within the returned content causes the browser to load a new about:blank document.
      3. This can result in the displayed URL in the address bar becoming `about:blank` while the page content can still be controlled by the malicious javascript.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Address Bar Spoofing:** The displayed URL in the address bar is `about:blank`, which doesn't accurately reflect the page's content, potentially masking malicious content.
   - **Improper URI Handling:** The browser incorrectly handles the  `javascript:` URL, which is used to construct the about:blank page and its principal and URI, leaving it open to exploitation.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **User Deception:** Users may be tricked into believing they are on a trusted `about:blank` page, when the content could be maliciously controlled. This can facilitate phishing attacks or other forms of social engineering.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   -  An attacker can use a `javascript:` URL with a `location.reload()` to navigate to a page that spoofs `about:blank`. This is achieved by:
        1. Including a `javascript:` URL within a page.
        2. Opening the `javascript:` URL in a new tab through a modifier click (middle-click) or other similar actions.
        3. Having the `javascript:` code contain a script to call `location.reload()`.
        4. Subsequently, the code navigates to the malicious content.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to create or control a page that contains a `javascript:` URL.
   - The user needs to interact with this page by opening the `javascript:` URL in a new tab or window (middle click, etc.)

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The bug report includes several iterations of patches to address this vulnerability. The initial patch attempted to pass the originating page's principal, while subsequent patches also had to account for user context IDs and origin attributes.
*   The fix involves ensuring that about:blank pages loaded through `javascript:` URLs inherit the principal of the linking page and do not have both the principal URI and document URI be `about:blank`.
*  The final patch creates a new principal with the correct origin attributes and assigns it to the document.
*   The vulnerability can occur in both new tabs and new windows.
*   The issue was identified and fixed in Firefox version 52.

In summary, the content details a spoofing vulnerability related to how `javascript:` URLs are handled in Firefox, leading to misleading address bar displays. The detailed bug report highlights the complexity involved in patching the issue, particularly the need to consider user context IDs and origin attributes.
