## Why you might need it

Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this directly is [`mail()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php). However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules – the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!

The PHP `mail()` function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms, however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server; PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the `mail()` function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and [safer](https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html) to use SMTP to localhost.

*Please* don't be tempted to do it yourself – if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that
you should look at before rolling your own. Try [SwiftMailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/)
, [Laminas/Mail](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-mail/), [ZetaComponents](https://github.com/zetacomponents/Mail), etc.

Please read [LICENSE](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/LICENSE) for information on the software availability and distribution.

## Installation & loading

PHPMailer is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install PHPMailer. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```
"phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.9.2"
```

or run

```
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PHPMailer.

If you want to use XOAUTH2 authentication, you will also need to add a dependency on the `league/oauth2-client` and appropriate service adapters package in your `composer.json`, or take a look at
by @decomplexity's [SendOauth2 wrapper](https://github.com/decomplexity/SendOauth2), especially if you're using Microsoft services.

Alternatively, if you're not using Composer, you
can [download PHPMailer as a zip file](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), (note that docs and examples are not included in the zip file), then copy the contents of the PHPMailer folder into one of the `include_path` directories specified in your PHP configuration and load each class file manually:

```
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/Exception.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/SMTP.php';
```

If you're not using the `SMTP` class explicitly (you're probably not), you don't need a `use` line for the SMTP class. Even if you're not using exceptions, you do still need to load the `Exception` class as it is used internally.

## Legacy versions

PHPMailer 5.2 (which is compatible with PHP 5.0 — 7.0) is no longer supported, even for security updates. You will find the latest version of 5.2 in the [5.2-stable branch](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/5.2-stable). If you're using PHP 5.5 or later (which you should be), switch to the 6.x releases.

### Upgrading from 5.2

The biggest changes are that source files are now in the `src/` folder, and PHPMailer now declares the namespace `PHPMailer\PHPMailer`. This has several important effects – [read the upgrade guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/UPGRADING.md) for more details.

### Minimal installation

While installing the entire package manually or with Composer is simple, convenient, and reliable, you may want to include only vital files in your project. At the very least you will need [src/PHPMailer.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/PHPMailer.php). If you're using SMTP, you'll need [src/SMTP.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/SMTP.php), and if you're using POP-before SMTP (*very* unlikely!), you'll need [src/POP3.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/POP3.php). You can skip the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder if you're not showing errors to users and can make do with English-only errors. If you're using XOAUTH2 you will need [src/OAuth.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/OAuth.php) as well as the Composer dependencies for the services you wish to authenticate with. Really, it's much easier to use Composer!

## A Simple Example

```
<?php
//Import PHPMailer classes into the global namespace
//These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

//Load Composer's autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

//Create an instance; passing `true` enables exceptions
$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    //Server settings
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;                      //Enable verbose debug output
    $mail->isSMTP();                                            //Send using SMTP
    $mail->Host       = 'smtp.example.com';                     //Set the SMTP server to send through
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;                                   //Enable SMTP authentication
    $mail->Username   = 'user@example.com';                     //SMTP username
    $mail->Password   = 'secret';                               //SMTP password
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS;            //Enable implicit TLS encryption
    $mail->Port       = 465;                                    //TCP port to connect to; use 587 if you have set `SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS`

    //Recipients
    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('joe@example.net', 'Joe User');     //Add a recipient
    $mail->addAddress('ellen@example.com');               //Name is optional
    $mail->addReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');
    $mail->addCC('cc@example.com');
    $mail->addBCC('bcc@example.com');

    //Attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/var/tmp/file.tar.gz');         //Add attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/tmp/image.jpg', 'new.jpg');    //Optional name

    //Content
    $mail->isHTML(true);                                  //Set email format to HTML
    $mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';
    $mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';
    $mail->AltBody = 'This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
```

You'll find plenty to play with in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder, which covers many common scenarios including sending through Gmail, building contact forms, sending to mailing lists, and more.

If you are re-using the instance (e.g. when sending to a mailing list), you may need to clear the recipient list to avoid sending duplicate messages. See [the mailing list example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/mailing_list.phps) for further guidance.

That's it. You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!

## Localization

PHPMailer defaults to English, but in the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder, you'll find many translations for PHPMailer error messages that you may encounter. Their filenames contain [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code for the translations, for example `fr` for French. To specify a language, you need to tell PHPMailer which one to use, like this:

```
//To load the French version
$mail->setLanguage('fr', '/optional/path/to/language/directory/');
```

We welcome corrections and new languages – if you're looking for corrections, run the [Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php) script in the tests folder and it will show any missing translations.

## Documentation

Examples of how to use PHPMailer for common scenarios can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder. If you're looking for a good starting point, we recommend you start with [the Gmail example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples/gmail.phps).

To reduce PHPMailer's deployed code footprint, examples are not included if you load PHPMailer via Composer or via [GitHub's zip file download](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), so you'll need to either clone the git repository or use the above links to get to the examples directly.

Complete generated API documentation is [available online](https://phpmailer.github.io/PHPMailer/).

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed. You may find [the unit tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/PHPMailer/PHPMailerTest.php) a good reference for how to do various operations such as encryption.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpmailer), and before you ask a question about "SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host.", [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Tests

[PHPMailer tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/test/) use PHPUnit 9, with [a polyfill](https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills) to let 9-style tests run on older PHPUnit and PHP versions.

[![Test status](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/actions)

If this isn't passing, is there something you can do to help?

## Security

Please disclose any vulnerabilities found responsibly – report security issues to the maintainers privately.

See [SECURITY](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/SECURITY.md) and [PHPMailer's security advisories on GitHub](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/security).

## Contributing

Please submit bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/issues).

We're particularly interested in fixing edge cases, expanding test coverage, and updating translations.

If you found a mistake in the docs, or want to add something, go ahead and amend the wiki – anyone can edit it.

If you have git clones from prior to the move to the PHPMailer GitHub organisation, you'll need to update any remote URLs referencing the old GitHub location with a command like this from within your clone:

```
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer.git
```

Please *don't* use the SourceForge or Google Code projects any more; they are obsolete and no longer maintained.

## History

* PHPMailer was originally written in 2001 by Brent R. Matzelle as a [SourceForge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmailer/).
* [Marcus Bointon](https://github.com/Synchro) (`coolbru` on SF) and Andy Prevost (`codeworxtech`) took over the project in 2004.
* Became an Apache incubator project on Google Code in 2010, managed by Jim Jagielski.
* Marcus created [his fork on GitHub](https://github.com/Synchro/PHPMailer) in 2008.
* Jim and Marcus decide to join forces and use GitHub as the canonical and official repo for PHPMailer in 2013.
* PHPMailer moves to [the PHPMailer organisation](https://github.com/PHPMailer) on GitHub in 2013.

### What's changed since moving from SourceForge?

* Official successor to the SourceForge and Google Code projects.
* Test suite.
* Continuous integration with GitHub Actions.
* Composer support.
* Public development.
* Additional languages and language strings.
* CRAM-MD5 authentication support.
* Preserves full repo history of authors, commits, and branches from the original SourceForge project.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Security notices relating to PHPMailer

Please disclose any security issues or vulnerabilities found through [Tidelift's coordinated disclosure system](https://tidelift.com/security) or to the maintainers privately.

PHPMailer 6.4.1 and earlier contain a vulnerability that can result in untrusted code being called (if such code is injected into the host project's scope by other means). If the `$patternselect` parameter to `validateAddress()` is set to `'php'` (the default, defined by `PHPMailer::$validator`), and the global namespace contains a function called `php`, it will be called in preference to the built-in validator of the same name. Mitigated in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of simple strings as validator function names. Recorded as [CVE-2021-3603](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-3603). Reported by Vikrant Singh Chauhan via [huntr.dev](https://www.huntr.dev/).

PHPMailer versions 6.4.1 and earlier contain a possible remote code execution vulnerability through the `$lang_path` parameter of the `setLanguage()` method. If the `$lang_path` parameter is passed unfiltered from user input, it can be set to [a UNC path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats#unc-paths), and if an attacker is also able to persuade the server to load a file from that UNC path, a script file under their control may be executed. This vulnerability only applies to systems that resolve UNC paths, typically only Microsoft Windows.
PHPMailer 6.5.0 mitigates this by no longer treating translation files as PHP code, but by parsing their text content directly. This approach avoids the possibility of executing unknown code while retaining backward compatibility. This isn't ideal, so the current translation format is deprecated and will be replaced in the next major release. Recorded as [CVE-2021-34551](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-34551). Reported by [Jilin Diting Information Technology Co., Ltd](https://listensec.com) via Tidelift.

PHPMailer versions between 6.1.8 and 6.4.0 contain a regression of the earlier CVE-2018-19296 object injection vulnerability as a result of [a fix for Windows UNC paths in 6.1.8](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/e2e07a355ee8ff36aba21d0242c5950c56e4c6f9). Recorded as [CVE-2020-36326](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-36326). Reported by Fariskhi Vidyan via Tidelift. 6.4.1 fixes this issue, and also enforces stricter checks for URL schemes in local path contexts.

PHPMailer versions 6.1.5 and earlier contain an output escaping bug that occurs in `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` when filenames passed into `addAttachment` and other methods that accept attachment names contain double quote characters, in contravention of RFC822 3.4.1. No specific vulnerability has been found relating to this, but it could allow file attachments to bypass attachment filters that are based on matching filename extensions. Recorded as [CVE-2020-13625](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-13625). Reported by Elar Lang of Clarified Security.

PHPMailer versions prior to 6.0.6 and 5.2.27 are vulnerable to an object injection attack by passing `phar://` paths into `addAttachment()` and other functions that may receive unfiltered local paths, possibly leading to RCE. Recorded as [CVE-2018-19296](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-19296). See [this article](https://knasmueller.net/5-answers-about-php-phar-exploitation) for more info on this type of vulnerability. Mitigated by blocking the use of paths containing URL-protocol style prefixes such as `phar://`. Reported by Sehun Oh of cyberone.kr.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.24 (released July 26th 2017) have an XSS vulnerability in one of the code examples, [CVE-2017-11503](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-11503). The `code_generator.phps` example did not filter user input prior to output. This file is distributed with a `.phps` extension, so it is not normally executable unless it is explicitly renamed, and the file is not included when PHPMailer is loaded through composer, so it is safe by default. There was also an undisclosed potential XSS vulnerability in the default exception handler (unused by default). Patches for both issues kindly provided by Patrick Monnerat of the Fedora Project.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.22 (released January 9th 2017) have a local file disclosure vulnerability, [CVE-2017-5223](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5223). If content passed into `msgHTML()` is sourced from unfiltered user input, relative paths can map to absolute local file paths and added as attachments. Also note that `addAttachment` (just like `file_get_contents`, `passthru`, `unlink`, etc) should not be passed user-sourced params either! Reported by Yongxiang Li of Asiasecurity.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.20 (released December 28th 2016) are vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10045](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10045) a remote code execution vulnerability, responsibly reported by [Dawid Golunski](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10045-Vuln-Patch-Bypass.html), and patched by Paul Buonopane (@Zenexer).

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.18 (released December 2016) are vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10033](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10033) a remote code execution vulnerability, responsibly reported by [Dawid Golunski](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html).

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.14 (released November 2015) are vulnerable to [CVE-2015-8476](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8476) an SMTP CRLF injection bug permitting arbitrary message sending.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.10 (released May 2015) are vulnerable to [CVE-2008-5619](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-5619), a remote code execution vulnerability in the bundled html2text library. This file was removed in 5.2.10, so if you are using a version prior to that and make use of the html2text function, it's vitally important that you upgrade and remove this file.

PHPMailer versions prior to 2.0.7 and 2.2.1 are vulnerable to [CVE-2012-0796](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-0796), an email header injection attack.

Joomla 1.6.0 uses PHPMailer in an unsafe way, allowing it to reveal local file paths, reported in [CVE-2011-3747](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-3747).

PHPMailer didn't sanitise the `$lang_path` parameter in `SetLanguage`. This wasn't a problem in itself, but some apps (PHPClassifieds, ATutor) also failed to sanitise user-provided parameters passed to it, permitting semi-arbitrary local file inclusion, reported in [CVE-2010-4914](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-4914), [CVE-2007-2021](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-2021) and [CVE-2006-5734](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2006-5734).

PHPMailer 1.7.2 and earlier contained a possible DDoS vulnerability reported in [CVE-2005-1807](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2005-1807).

PHPMailer 1.7 and earlier (June 2003) have a possible vulnerability in the `SendmailSend` method where shell commands may not be sanitised. Reported in [CVE-2007-3215](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-3215).
