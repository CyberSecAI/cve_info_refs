Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.22 handle content passed to the `msgHTML()` function. Specifically, if the content includes relative paths that are sourced from unfiltered user input, these relative paths can be resolved to absolute local file paths and then be added as attachments, leading to local file disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to disclose local files by including relative paths in user-supplied input to `msgHTML()`.
- **Unfiltered User Input:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data before it's used within the `msgHTML()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive files present on the server's file system. This could lead to the disclosure of configuration files, passwords, source code, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is then processed by the `msgHTML()` function.
- The attacker includes relative file paths (e.g., `<img src="/etc/passwd">`) within the message content submitted to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content into the application that utilizes PHPMailer and passes the content to the `msgHTML()` method. This could be through a contact form, a user profile editor, or any other place that takes user-supplied content that PHPMailer will process.
- The application needs to be vulnerable, meaning that it is using an affected version of PHPMailer and not sanitizing user input before passing it to `msgHTML()`.
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by providing malicious input to the web application, thus causing the server to disclose internal file data within the email.

**Additional Details**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can use a form to send an email with a payload such as `<img src="/etc/passwd">`, which then causes the server to include the contents of `/etc/passwd` within an email sent to the attacker.
- The vulnerability exists in PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.22, released on January 9th, 2017.
- It's noted that `addAttachment()` should also not be used with user supplied parameters.
