  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the calculation of temporary buffer size for user-provided ioctl arguments within the VideoCore DRM driver (vc4).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `vc4_get_bcl` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/vc4_gem.c` doesn't properly check for integer overflows when calculating the size of a temporary buffer to store user-provided data from a `VC4_SUBMIT_CL` ioctl call. Specifically, the addition for `shader_rec_offset` was not checked against an integer overflow. A large `bin_cl_size` could cause an under-allocation of the temporary buffer. Subsequently, `copy_from_user` writes data into this undersized buffer, leading to a heap buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can cause a denial of service (kernel panic/OOPS) via an incorrect pointer dereference. By providing crafted size values in a `VC4_SUBMIT_CL` ioctl call, a local attacker can trigger the overflow, leading to a crash when the kernel attempts to dereference an uninitialized pointer because of the under-allocation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacker via a crafted `VC4_SUBMIT_CL` ioctl call to the VideoCore DRM driver.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to make ioctl calls to the VideoCore DRM driver."
