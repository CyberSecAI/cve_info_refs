The provided content contains vulnerability information related to **CVE-2017-5907**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper or disabled TLS certificate validation in the "Great Southern Mobile Banking" iOS application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application does not properly validate the TLS certificate of the server it connects to (gsbmobile.com). This allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to present a fake certificate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can intercept sensitive data transmitted by the application, such as username and password.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
-  The attacker needs to be in a physically proximate location or in a privileged network position to intercept the communication between the app and the server. This could involve being on the same Wi-Fi network or having control over network infrastructure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be in a position to intercept network traffic, either through physical proximity (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network) or by controlling a network device within the communication path.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication to the app or server.
