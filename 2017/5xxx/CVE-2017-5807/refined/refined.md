  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2017-5807",
      "root_cause": "The OmniInet.exe service blindly copies the filename value from FTP_PUT_FILE requests into a fixed-length stack buffer without performing length checks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack buffer overflow"

       "root_cause": "The OmniInet.exe service does not validate the argc field in EXEC_SCRIPT requests. An attacker can provide an overly large argc value without the corresponding program arguments.",
