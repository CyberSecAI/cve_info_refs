Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5712:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in Intel Management Engine (ME), Intel Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119) leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Remote authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code with extended privileges. This may lead to:
    -  Impersonation of the ME/SPS/TXE.
    -  Compromising local security feature attestation validity.
    -  Loading and execution of arbitrary code outside the visibility of the user and operating system.
    -  System crash or instability.
    - Unauthenticated access to sensitive data.
    - Execution of arbitrary code

**Attack vectors:**
-  Network access is required for the attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.
-  The attacker needs to be authenticated with high privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:H).

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- Siemens indicates that the attacker must have network access for CVE-2017-5712.
- NetApp states that no NetApp products shipped with the vulnerable firmware.
- ASUS provides a list of affected motherboards and available updates.
- Intel has issued a security advisory (INTEL-SA-00086) detailing the vulnerability.
