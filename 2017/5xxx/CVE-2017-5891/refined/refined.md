CVE-2017-5891:
Root cause: The ASUS RT router login page lacks CSRF protection.
Weaknesses: Lack of CSRF protection on the login page and various pages within the interface where settings can be saved.
Impact: Malicious websites can submit login requests or change settings without the user's knowledge, if default credentials are used or the attacker knows the router's username and password.
Attack vectors: A malicious website visited by a user on the same network.
Required attacker capabilities: The attacker needs to know or guess the router's local IP address and either know the router's credentials or rely on the user using the default credentials ("admin/admin").

CVE-2017-5892:
Root cause: Multiple JSONP endpoints in the router interface reveal various data.
Weaknesses: JSONP endpoints that disclose router information without proper access controls.
Impact: Attackers can potentially exfiltrate router data, including network information, surrounding access points, devices on the network, external IP addresses, and WebDAV information.
Attack vectors: A malicious website visited by a user on the same network can use SCRIPT tags to load the JSONP endpoints if a matching function name exists on that site, but does require a logged in session.
Required attacker capabilities: The attacker needs to know the router's local IP address and have the user log into the router.
