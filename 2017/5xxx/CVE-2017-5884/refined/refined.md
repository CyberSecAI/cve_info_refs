{
  "CVE-2017-5884": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper check of framebuffer boundaries when processing a tile in gtk-vnc.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "The code does not properly check boundaries of subrectangle-containing tiles during RRE, hextile, and copyrect encoding processing.",
       "Missing bounds checks on the payload data parameters."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious VNC server could use this flaw to overwrite parts of the client memory, potentially leading to code execution under privileges of the user running the VNC client or crash the client.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious VNC server sends specially crafted RRE, hextile, or copyrect tile data to the client."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the VNC server that connects to the vulnerable client."
  }
