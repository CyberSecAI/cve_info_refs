  "response": {
    "cve": "CVE-2017-5428",
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `createImageBitmap()` function when processing malformed web content, specifically in the handling of ArrayBuffer and ArrayBufferView arguments.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerability in `createImageBitmap()`.",
      "Lack of input validation in `RecyclingPlanarYCbCrImage::CopyData`."
    ],
    "impact": "A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted web page",
      "Exploitation of the `createImageBitmap()` API with crafted `ArrayBuffer` or `ArrayBufferView` arguments"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to the victim.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was discovered during the Pwn2Own contest. The fix involves disabling the experimental extensions to the `createImageBitmap` API and adding input validation. The vulnerable code was added in bug 1141979, and was not properly reviewed or tested before being exposed to the web. The vulnerable code resides in `CreateImageFromBufferSourceRawData` and `RecyclingPlanarYCbCrImage::CopyData`, and a related issue in `CopyPlane`. A patch was developed to mitigate the integer overflow issue but ultimately the API was disabled until the underlying code could be rewritten and hardened. The issue also involves a lack of validation on `layout` arguments. Fuzzing was also cited as a necessary requirement before re-enabling the API. Further, the bug report indicates that there are other potential integer overflow issues in the code which should be investigated."
