Looking at Firefox.md, the source code region seems to have been added in [bug 1141979](/show_bug.cgi?id=1141979 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FoxEye] Extend ImageBitmap with interfaces to access its underlying image data"):
[FoxEye] Extend ImageBitmap with interfaces to access its underlying image data
Specifically the CreateImageFromBufferSourceRawData function at:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/0282afe01d9e#l1.39>
and the following lines, possibly:
+ // Create a layers::Image and set data.
+ if (aFormat == ImageBitmapFormat::YUV444P ||
+ aFormat == ImageBitmapFormat::YUV422P ||
+ aFormat == ImageBitmapFormat::YUV420P) {
+ RefPtr<layers::PlanarYCbCrImage> image =
+ new layers::RecyclingPlanarYCbCrImage(new layers::BufferRecycleBin());
+
+ if (NS\_WARN\_IF(!image)) {

+ }
+
+ // Set Data.
+ if (NS\_WARN\_IF(!image->CopyData(data))) {
+ return nullptr;

+
+ return image.forget();
+ } else {
The Firefox.md file mentions: "Nothing is checked before the data is passed into `RecyclingPlanarYCbCrImage::CopyData`."

Steps to reproduce for developers:
1. Download files "magic.html", "index.html" and "long.min.js" from this bug into the same directory.
2. Create a file "shellcode" with any content (otherwise the XHR in magic.html fails).
3. Launch the browser, pointing to "index.html".
Reproduces cleanly on AddressSanitizer builds (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Testing/Firefox_and_Address_Sanitizer>).

Is the code above this ok?
const uint8\_t\* srcBufferPtr = aBufferData;
uint8\_t\* dstBufferPtr = dstMap.GetData();
for (int i = 0; i < srcSize.height; ++i) {
memcpy(dstBufferPtr, srcBufferPtr, srcStride);
srcBufferPtr += srcStride;
dstBufferPtr += dstMap.GetStride();
}
and such.
(ok, that might just read random data)

I removed the shellcode bits. This crashes for me locally, and should crash when loaded directly from bugzilla (since I changed the link to point to bugzilla's long.min.js file attached above).

(This doesn't fix the crashes I can reproduce using the above, though, but it was the first thing I looked at given the description in Firefox.md ([attachment 8848316](/attachment.cgi?id=8848316 "Firefox.md") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8848316&action=edit "Firefox.md")), and seems like it may well be bad given the way CopyData is called from the function above.)

The reason my previous patch didn't fix the exploit is that the result of this nice size\_t calculation got implicitly converted to uint32\_t both when calling AllocateBuffer and when assigning to mBufferSize. Using uint32\_t from the beginning does make the exploit no longer crash.

While people were looking at this code on IRC, it seemed like the more we looked at it, the more security holes we found. We decides that it's best to disable the API that [bug 1141979](/show_bug.cgi?id=1141979 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FoxEye] Extend ImageBitmap with interfaces to access its underlying image data") added altogether.

Right, you can't do this via IDL, because the IDL annotations control whether the function is exposed in JS, but there is only \_one\_ JS function for all the overloads...
It looks like <https://bug1141979.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=8686383> (from [bug 1141979](/show_bug.cgi?id=1141979 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FoxEye] Extend ImageBitmap with interfaces to access its underlying image data")) simply never got checked in? :(

I gave Ehsan the mozconfig to make an ASan build for fix verification later on, as I'm signing off now.

And please file a followup to make this stuff all saner. For example, have the bindings pass in the JSContext so we stop doing the "pass null on mainthread because we peeked at the impl" thing, and have a one-arg version of ImageBitmap::ExtensionsEnabled that just takes the cx, called from these two callsites and the two-arg version. But again, followup for that.

Disable Mozilla custom ImageBitmap extensions that didn't go through proper API review
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Impossible. We are removing the API the exploit can be written based on.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? Yes. They point to the entry point for the vulnerability.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? All, including ESR52 bug not ESR45.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? [Bug 1141979](/show_bug.cgi?id=1141979 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FoxEye] Extend ImageBitmap with interfaces to access its underlying image data").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? The patch should be backportable easily.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? This API was accidentally exposed to the Web, so there is web compat risk here. dveditz said someone from product has OK'ed the removal.
We should work on adding this back ASAP after fixing the code properly.

Fwiw, I got crashes on dbaron's testcase without the patch, no crashes with. Exceptions verified thrown instead with the patch.
I've just done two try pushes:
1) <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=f37932b94f0f1145407f1a880e55de00e67a7ecf> -- just Ehsan's patch (the version I was reviewing).
2) <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=e6d814a7c654e5e9a650a1936bef05f03a29dcb6> -- same thing but with our tests that set the pref changed to not set it, to verify that they would fail that way.

So, a few comments on this checking function relative to what RecyclingPlanarYCbCrImage::CopyData and its static helper CopyPlane do.
In CopyPlane, skip is the amount to skip, in the source only, between uint8\_t units. IsLayoutValid assumes that skip is only added after every bytesPerDataType bytes, but CopyPlane adds it every byte. This means that CopyPlane could copy past the stride in ways that IsLayoutValid wouldn't detect. It's not clear to me which the skip is supposed to be, although I have a sneaking suspicion that IsLayoutValid is right and CopyPlane is wrong.
CopyData also stores the skip values in its mData, despite CopyPlane \*not\* doing the skipping in its own buffer, only the source buffer. I'm not sure if anyone uses that, but if they do, it'll be wrong. (That's largely independent of IsLayoutValid.)
IsLayoutValid should also test bytesPerPixelStride.isValid(), to protect against layout.mSkip of 0xffffffff or similar.

CopyPlane is wrong then, based on the spec document.
This whole thing is a mess. We should definitely cauterize this out. This needs a minor rewrite before we can even think about turning this back on.
I'll see how far I get tomorrow.
However, we should not waste time trying to find a minimal fix for this gaping hole of an entrypoint.

patch that does directly fix integer overflows
Fwiw, this is exactly the spot that first caught my attention when I looked at the code yesterday and I tried to write an assert for it to catch the overflow there (but it didn't work on first attempt).
Imho we should make it impossible to have such multiplications in the code that are both unchecked and unannotated. Either the developer explicitly wants overflow to happen (and should express that with some kind of annotation), or overflow checking must happen. This could probably be enforced statically.

We're not unshipping createImageBitmap() function itself, just a non-standard overload we added. Pretty sure we never did an intent to ship on that part: it was supposed to be hidden behind an experimental pref in the first place.

That is very true, since even the comment in .webidl said that was supposed to happen, to disable the experimental code behind a pref.

I think fuzzing can help here, but I also believe (as I said in [comment 41](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348168#c41 "RESOLVED FIXED - integer overflow in createImageBitmap() overload accepting ArrayBuffer and ArrayBufferView arguments (pwn2own 2017)")) that the kind of integer overflow exploited here could probably be detected statically if we enforce that all intended overflows are annotated somehow by developers. I guess it should be possible to do this in e.g. clang with an additional pass or in their static analysis plugin. What I'm unsure about is the way of annotating. I know you can make annotations on a function level, not sure if that would be sufficient. In the end, I would like all code that does multiplications like this to simply not compile anymore if you don't annotate or use the checked API.

Fuzzing should be a \*requirement\* for an API that accepts a user buffer like this. The problem is that when the intention is to not ship an API, we have nothing to catch you if you screw something up and ship it by accident. We have some rudimentary protection against this in the form of test\_interfaces.html and friends, and this clearly shows that we need something more sophisticated.
, but I also believe (as I said in [comment 41](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348168#c41 "RESOLVED FIXED - integer overflow in createImageBitmap() overload accepting ArrayBuffer and ArrayBufferView arguments (pwn2own 2017)"))

That's not really practical. [Bug 1279569](/show_bug.cgi?id=1279569 "NEW"), however, is, and it would have caught this.
FTR (and not to sound bitter) we keep talking about this but we never act on this. I've been saying for years that there are whole classes of security vulnerabilities that we could \*completely\* eliminate from our code forever into the future using static analysis, but we need a concentrated effort around it. Often times because you can't land the analysis (to prevent more broken code from being checked in, and also to show a recipe for people to find security holes in Firefox) and often times the analysis find gazillions of issues. I am sounding like a broken record but I keep saying this. We need to focus on this more seriously. :-)

I am 100% with you and I feel exactly the same way about it. I started doing the UBSan work years ago, then I encountered the signed integer overflow problem. But we never got anywhere with it because e.g. layout/ just does it (tm) and while we discussed various ways to solve this situation (which in all cases involves developers), we never solved it. That is just frustrating. If static analysis here isn't practical, then maybe adding overflow checks at runtime is (clang can do this already for both signed and unsigned overflows). The problem here is and has always been performance. But maybe we can exclude some performance critical code and make the other behavior at least the default. That would cause runtime aborts. Instead of that, we could also truncate for stability reasons I guess (i.e. leave it at max/min)? I think the major problem is that integer overflow is almost never intended, so trying to shift the default behavior seems like the right approach to me, even if that is complicated.
Still curious about your proposal in [bug 1279569](/show_bug.cgi?id=1279569 "NEW") :)

Very simplistically speaking, this is a trade-off between programmer convenience and runtime efficiency as you note. The basic idea in [bug 1279569](/show_bug.cgi?id=1279569 "NEW") is to start to treat some arithmetic expressions that we know can have disastrous consequences in the case of an overflow as requiring overflow checks statically in order to hopefully come up with a good trade-off here.
> Still curious about your proposal in [bug 1279569](/show_bug.cgi?id=1279569 "NEW") :)
FWIW I'm not claiming \_I\_ had a good proposal there, see [bug 1279569 comment 28](/show_bug.cgi?id=1279569#c28 "NEW"). :-) Now I think it makes a lot of sense to treat some variable names especially. This bug was definitely a good learning experience.

intent to unship email
I think we need to be clearer that we are \_not\_ disabling the standard createImageBitmap overloads. Maybe in the first paragraph, replace "no other engine ships this API" with "no other engine ships this overload of createImageBitmap" and "unship the API" with "unship the non-standard overload"?
And maybe emphasize that this overload was never release noted, is not documented anywhere, and would throw in any other browser, and hence the chances of anyone using it are extremely low?

"not documented anywhere" is probably too strong, given that there's a spec for it at <https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-worker/#imagebitmapfactories-interface-extensions> . (Contrast with the spec for the primary createImageBitmap at <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#images-2> .)

That's fair. Not documented on MDN, or other places that are actually documentation for this stuff that people read. ;)
That spec needs a lot of work, by the way. :(

intent to unship email
f+ with nits? :-)
I'm with Boris that you should be clearer in the sentence in the first paragraph that we're not unshipping the entire API. You get more specific later, but let's not alarm people at the top.
that is:
As to the best of our knowledge no other engine ships this API and we never intended to ship it and never publicized the fact that we did, we decided that the best course of action, as unusual as this would be, is to immediately unship the API.
"this API" could mean the entire function, while you intend it to mean only one overloaded version. So something like "no other engine ships this variant of createImageBitmap... unship this variant of the API."
Would really like not to send this until after the release is available.

Confirmed crash using dbaron's POC on Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and Android ARM, Fx52 release.
Verified no crash using Fx52.0.1 (Linux/Android) and Fx52.0.1esr (Linux).
Sometimes the crash took several page refreshes on affected builds to reproduce, so I did this many times on fixed builds to make sure it no longer happens.
On fixed builds, we see page text indicating "failed to find corrupted array".

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
