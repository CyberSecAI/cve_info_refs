Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5211:

**CVE-2017-5211**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTML "map" elements within the Open-Xchange platform. Specifically, the `area` elements within a `map` could be exploited for tabnabbing attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of sufficient sanitization or security measures when rendering HTML content, particularly concerning the `map` tag and its related `area` elements. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into an HTML context.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack could result in tabnabbing. This means that when a user clicks on a link within the manipulated HTML content, the attacker could redirect the user to a malicious page in the same tab.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector would involve crafting HTML content with malicious `map` and `area` elements.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious HTML content into a place where it will be viewed by a victim.  This could be through email, shared documents, or any other method the system allows the display of user-provided HTML.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a client-side issue that relies on injecting a `map` tag and `area` element that can result in a tabnabbing attack.  The patch addresses the issue by preventing form submits, opening new windows manually, nulling window.opener, and redirecting forms to the new window, then manually submitting the form. Additionally, the `form` and `input` elements were removed from the HTML sanitizing white-list.
