{
  "CVE-2017-5503": {
    "Description": "The dec_clnpass function in libjasper/jpc/jpc_t1dec.c in JasPer 1.900.27 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory write and crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies within the dec_clnpass function in jpc_t1dec.c. It performs an invalid memory write due to a missing bounds check when processing a crafted image.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing bounds check"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering a crash due to an invalid memory write. Potentially, it could also lead to other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path during decoding.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted image file to a system that uses the vulnerable JasPer library. No specific privileges or authentication are required."
