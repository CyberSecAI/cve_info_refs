{
  "CVE-2017-5256": {
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Device Name and System Description fields within the web administration console.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with a low-privileged user account can inject malicious scripts. These scripts can then be used to perform session hijacking, browser hooking, or other privilege escalation activities on subsequent users, including the administrator account. This allows the attacker to gain full control of the device and the entire WiFi network being served by it.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed through the web administration console. An attacker can inject malicious javascript code into the Device Name and System Description fields that is then executed in the browser sessions of other users who access the administration console.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid, low-privileged user account on the affected device, or in the case of some users, needs to bypass client-side protections to make the vulnerable fields editable. An adjacent network position (i.e., connected to the same WiFi network) is also required for initial access to the device management interface."
