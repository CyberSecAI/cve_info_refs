{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA P4 function `msp` (MSPRuntimeInterface) does not require authorization to call functions like `getInformation`, `getParameters`, `getServiceInfo`, `getStatistic`, and `getClientStatistic`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure due to missing authorization checks on the `msp` function calls.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An anonymous attacker can send a special request and retrieve sensitive information about the SAP system. This can lead to broken authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable SAP system. No prior privileges are required."
