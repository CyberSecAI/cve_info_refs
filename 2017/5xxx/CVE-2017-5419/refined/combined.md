What was different to other hijacks was this loaded a 403 password modal dialogue and could not be cleared. The only way to close the rogue site was to shut down the browser from task manager.
Expected results:
data urls should not be able to render pages and should not be able to trigger dialogues especially modal dialogue boxes that prevent navigating away from the site

This isn't related to the data: URL (you could cause multiple http auth prompts from a 'normal' webpage too), and we would likely not be able to break data: URLs altogether anyway. The problem is the repeated prompts making it impossible to close the site.
Patrick, is there a way we could limit these prompts if making them tab-modal isn't feasible in the near future?Blocks: [eviltraps](/show_bug.cgi?id=432687 "NEW - [meta] Protect users from websites that trap them or destroy their experience")Group: firefox-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → Networking: HTTPFlags: needinfo?(mcmanus)Keywords: [csectype-dos](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-dos&resolution=---),

Not sure what the state of that bug is. Dragana? Just quickly - what is status of that bug?

> Honza, can you think of anything else that would (help)?
The first idea that popped to my mind was to queue the prompts, but recently I touched that code and thought we were already was doing that. Double checking if that is broken or not would be good (LoginManagerPrompter.js).
Bad thing is that just queuing will not get rid of all the modal dialogs flood. Something like "don't ask me for auth from this page" check box, similar what we have for MsgBox would do (a UI change). Only refresh of the page by the user would allow it again then.
I'll try to find time to think of something simpler tho.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz) → needinfo?(dd.mozilla)

Queue the prompts, and have a longer and longer time in between subsequent prompts, ramping up quickly? After some number of queued prompts, just auto-fail auth requests for that page for a while. It's a bit opaque, but maybe we can mitigate it with a doorhanger popup that says "This page has created too many auth prompts in a short period of time, we're going to disable it until you reload"? (i18n impact, but still)

In a 'normal' case where a website needs resources, cancel (or not providing correct credentials) will break that resource, likely necessitating a reload anyway. I don't think we need to wait for the second/third cancel - if the user makes a mistake, they'll want to reload the page anyway.

Boris, I'd like to ask for a little help here.
I want to track the number of authentication prompts a page invokes (via a subresource or iframe) and user cancels them as mitigation to the bloat this bug deals with.
In nsLoginManagerPrompter.js (note this is js, so no access to nsPI\* interfaces) I only have access to the outer window (nsDocShell->mScriptGlobal->AsOuter(), which is nsGlobalWindow AFAIK). I'm trying to implement a counter nsLoginManagerPrompter could access and which simply resets when top level navigation happens. Sounds like the point of reset is nsGlobalWindow::SetNewDocument. But here I may need a new property exposed to chrome on global window, not sure it's the way to go.
Other option is this: I can reach the browser's chrome document element and set attributes on it (keep the counter there). But I don't know how to reset this attribute easily on navigation/reload. Apparently, browser doc element is not the one that resets in nsGlobalWindow::SetNewDocument (mDoc).
So, the question is, do you know about something that is reachable in chrome js from the outer window, capable of storing arbitrary data (the counter) and is reset on navigation/reload? :)

Is your chrome js running in the content process or the chrome process?
Because window.document seems like a totally reasonable place to store this information. You can ether use an expando (over Xrays) with a suitably chosen symbol name or string name of some sort, or a weakmap with the document as the key. But obviously that's only a good idea in the content process. Of course poking at the docshell in the chrome process is bad too, so I really hope you're in the content process.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

The login manager solely runs in chrome. To be more precise, it's queried at TabParent::GetAuthPrompt <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/3e73fd638e687a4d7f46613586e5156b8e2af846/dom/ipc/TabParent.cpp#2424>

No, I'm not on the content process :( I can access the tab's window.document, tho. Only problem is that it doesn't reset (drop) my added custom attribute when reload/navigation happens in the tab.
Note that the counter must not be accessible to content.

Ok, but then that's a CPOW if the window is the content window, so we don't want to be doing that.
But if you're in TabParent::GetAuthPrompt then none of that is relevant: the "window" variable there is the browser window, not the webpage window, and I expect that's what gets passed to nsLoginManagerPrompter.js. You can double-check what its .document.URL is, but I expect it's chrome://whatever/browser.xul.
So we need to either implement this counter down lower where we still know which exact content window (or I guess toplevel content window is the part we really care about) is doing the prompting or we need to propagate the information about the toplevel content window that's doing the prompting up to nsLoginManagerPrompter.js.

Thanks Boris, you are right, it's browser.xul. Hence, I don't think this is going to be that easy.
I could store the counter there but I didn't find a spot where I could reset it on reload/navigation. My knowledge of remote browser is thin.Whiteboard: [necko-active] → [necko-next]

The right answer is to either propagate the inner window id of the toplevel window along with requests (so you can key things off it), or to maintain the counter and its checks in the content process, before you ever get into that code...

Attached patch

[v1 (carry inner window id to httpchannelparent, limit cancled auth dialogs)](attachment.cgi?id=8807268&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8807268&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1312243&attachment=8807268)

two parts
http:
- carry top-document inner window id to http channel parent
- it has to be done manually, since for document loads the id is not present on load info (weird or expected?) and when I qi/gi it from the child tab's document (yes, it works!) I don't want to modify the existing load info
- in non-e10s we do this lazily in http channel base
pwd manager:
- pwd manager then tracks the number of auth dialogs canceled in a row withing a single page and when there are 3 auth dialogs canceled by the user, it will block any auth dialog within coming from context of the page (iframes/xhr/resources)
- the counter is stored on the parent browser document (broswer.xul) as an attribute
- the limit is preferable and can be turned off
- works in e10s and non-e10s
Justin, please check the pwd manager parts, Patrick, please check the http/ipc changes.
Boris, thanks for guidance!

That is ok, but that's not what happens in the non-e10s case in your patch, right? That case won't do the right thing, because it will get different ids for a page and its subframes. So a page can just create multiple iframes to bypass this.
I think you want to get the nsILoadContext, then get its topWindow (this gives you an outer window), then get the current inner's ID from it, or something along those lines.
Also, this bit:
>+ if (document) {
>+ nsPIDOMWindowOuter\* outer = document->GetWindow();
>+ nsCOMPtr<nsIInterfaceRequestor> windowIR = do\_QueryInterface(outer);

>+ if (windowUtils) {
>+ windowUtils->GetCurrentInnerWindowID(&contentWindowId);

>+ }
should instead be:
if (document) {
contentWindowId = document->InnerWindowID();
}

> Honza, can you think of anything else that would (help)?
Just FTR -- although I don't think it will help greatly -- but [bug 1230462](/show_bug.cgi?id=1230462 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clarify actual origin in prompt for cross-origin subresource HTTP authentication") made cross-origin auth prompts no longer show the Realm info ("The site says: xxx" stuff in [attachment 8803672](/attachment.cgi?id=8803672 "browserhijacking.png") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8803672&action=edit "browserhijacking.png")). Assuming that sticks, it would be interesting to see if we can just remove it from all HTTP auth prompts. This doesn't help directly with trapping, but makes it less useful when the site can't put any text in the dialog. (We removed the site-specified text from onbeforeunload prompts too, for the same reason.)

At risk of bikeshedding a little:
1) How about just making this a simple boolean? I think it's pretty unlike that this is something people would ever need to tune. Just give it a reasonable internal default (3), and let people disable it via pref if needed. (I think that's unlikely too, although it's still good to have so we can hotfix disable it if needed.)

You won't always have a \_chromeWindow available, unfortunately.
But other than needing to deal with this being undefined, I don't think that's a problem... AFAIK this can only happen with extension related code (the comment in init() suggests a JSM or Sandbox), so that's probably ok to not worry about traps occurring in such cases?

Instead of duplicating all this code from the existing runnable (a few lines down), I think it would simpler to just set a "shouldLimit" flag when the cancel limit is exceeded, and tweak the existing runnable code to skip showing an actual prompt when that flag was set.
For the master password uiBusy stuff on line 149, you could also add a check for shouldSkip so we don't try to bypass the prompt (since we know we'd just skip it anyway)... Although things would work just fine without doing this, so you don't actually need to do this.

I suspect we will hit users that may want to cancel 3 dialogs and expect the fourth to give it it's credentials. There are weird server configuration in the wild, also think of multiple auth challenges etc.. Hence, I'd rather keep the counter pref. We can turn it off easily with setting it to 0.
I'll gladly rename it to be closer to your suggestion.

Right, I think it's fine to not block repeated requests if there is no chromeWindow.
From a quick skim of the bug I'm not sure why the counter is on `prompter.\_chromeWindow.document…` since that is referring to browser.xul. I would have expected that the counter would be on something specific to the tab/contentDocument/contentWindow. Apologies if I'm missing context.Flags: needinfo?(MattN+bmo)

the code is running on parent. don't want to use CPOWs to get to the content. and this is a perfect place. there is just a single attribute per tab (exactly what I want). content window is id'ed only (all the other IPC stuff in the patch)

\_chromeWindow, as Matt already said, is browser.xul. I'm pretty sure that in your code there isn't "a single attribute per tab" - there is one attribute for all the tabs in the window, because (unless Matt and I are both mistaken...) you're setting it on the chrome XUL <window> element. If multiple tabs are navigating they would clobber the value you're storing (because the inner window IDs of the different tabs are different, of course).
At a guess, you may want to store this on the <browser> elements, or you may want to use a Map() from inner window IDs to counts, (which would of course "leak" that data until the chrome window goes away, which may or may not be something we care about).
Either way, I'm not sure why you're using an attribute and JSON serialization - you can just store an expando on the DOM element or the \_chromeWindow (effectively a global var in the chrome window), which makes using a single structure to cover all the tabs in the window more palatable.

You don't need a CPOW to store per-browser state as you can store it on the <browser> like Gijs said.
Your response isn't convincing me that you're handling multiple tabs properly. There is one browser.xul per visible window. I agree with everything Gijs says.

Side note: In code related to content which deals with ChromeWindow's I always like the variable names to be explicit about content vs. chrome and my insistence on renaming this variable lately (IIRC) is why I easily caught this bug.

Matt, Gijs, you are right.
I did a simple test: a top level page (no authentication) referring an iframe which requires auth. The top level page refreshes the iframe (location.reload()) every 4 seconds. If I open just one tab, the patch works. If I open two tabs, the attribute apparently refers to the \_windows\_ browser.xul\_ and not to the tab's entity (if there is such), since the id is apparently always different.

From a quick look at the code, I think prompter.\_browser refers to the correct browser element, though it does look like that might be relying on CPOWs... Matt would be able to confirm whether this works correctly.
> And expando is better, right. I somehow was convinced only acceptable value

setAttribute \*does\* only take strings, so you're right about that. What I meant is just setting
\_browser.\_someProp = someObject
which should work.

From a quick look, I was confused by this. Can we make sure that the property on the http channel is explicitly called \*toplevel\* content window ID? Because AIUI that's what it reflects, not the content window ID of the individual frame that might be causing the auth prompt.

Feels like it'd be a little simpler (and keep the .log) to put this in an else, and kill the early return, letting us fall through rather than duplicating the runnable dispatch.

Attached patch

[v2.3 (carry inner window id to httpchannelparent, limit cancled auth dialogs in pwdmngr)](attachment.cgi?id=8814466&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1312243&attachment=8814466)

Updated according [comment 42](/show_bug.cgi?id=1312243#c42 "RESOLVED FIXED - Trap site uses repeated http auth prompts to keep the user on the page").
BTW, there is still one way to perform the attack. When a page has an iframe asking for auth and the top level page reloads itself constantly, we are in the same situation again.

r=me but this (like any security/abuse prevention bug) really deserves a test (especially when we have existing ones to base it on). See toolkit/components/passwordmgr/test/mochitest/test\_prompt\_http.html for one example. I think the `handlePrompt` test helper should make this not very painful.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: since ever
[User impact if declined]: complete blockade of UI through a number of modal auth dialogs
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: somewhat, we have tests for these parts of code, but not for this particular issue (filed a followup [bug 1323973](/show_bug.cgi?id=1323973 "RESOLVED FIXED - Write tests for patch from bug 1312243 (auth dialog abuse blocker)"))
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: locally, yes

[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none
[Is the change risky?]: I think not
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: reload of a page discards any auth dialog limits this patch introduces, it can also be turned off by a preference
[String changes made/needed]: none

The links from [comment 57](/show_bug.cgi?id=1312243#c57 "RESOLVED FIXED - Trap site uses repeated http auth prompts to keep the user on the page") does not work anymore so I had a look at the duplicate bugs here but was unable to find some link or a testcase in order to reproduce/verify this bug.
I used the data URI attached in [bug 1312836 comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1312836#c1 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - browser takeover/denial of service via data URI and HTTP authentication dialog") but under Windows 7 and macOS 10.12.3 I see the same behavior on Fx 49.0 (which should be not fixed) as on Fx 52 beta 8 (which should be fixed), with every click on that webpage Fx will open window after window.
Chris, I know it's been a long time but could you reliable reproduce this? If yes can you make public the website you used?
If anyone else knows how I can reproduce (in order to verify) this please let me know, it will be much appreciated.Flags: needinfo?(firefox-bugzilla)

Sorry The site appears to be assist.support-care-uk.in (from the image I posted) but it no longer exists.
Because of the nature of the exploit I was not able to copy the data URL.
I have searched through my history and have a gap around the time of the incident. Which would be because I had to kill the browser so its recent history was not flushed to disk.
The only places in my history I visited around that time and date were netflix and google. I do not recall what the original site was but I was pulled into a rapid circle jerk which finished at the data URL. I could not reproduce it if I tried.

As the links from [comment 57](/show_bug.cgi?id=1312243#c57 "RESOLVED FIXED - Trap site uses repeated http auth prompts to keep the user on the page") and from the duplicate bugs don't work anymore, I tried to find another valid links that can trigger this issue, but with no luck.

Note that this fixes only a case when a page contains an iframe that 1) asks for auth 2) is reloaded by the top level page on and on. If such the page would reload itself (not just the iframe), the patch would not help.

And another note that this only protects against abuse auth prompts, nothing else.

Some steps to reproduce are still required in order to correctly verify this bug. Honza, Do you think this can still be verified at this point or should we ignore it in the future?

Is the test in [bug 377496](/show_bug.cgi?id=377496 "VERIFIED FIXED - 'Authentication Required' dialogue being application modal produces a vector for attack") enough?

|  | |

In [bug 377496](/show_bug.cgi?id=377496 "VERIFIED FIXED - 'Authentication Required' dialogue being application modal produces a vector for attack"), there are 2 test cases:

1. A test case in the description: opening a page (<http://gobase.org/studying/articles/mioch/7/index.html>) and the authentification prompt would appear by default. The authentification prompt does not appear anymore.
2. Another test case in the comment section (<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=377496#c36>): which has a test page (<http://www.httpwatch.com/httpgallery/authentication/#showExample10>). Clickin the "DISPLAY IMAGE" button will trigger an authentification prompt. In this case, the prompt is displayed, and the page is still somewhat unusable (only scrolling it is possible while the prompt is not dismissed).

* Clicking the prompt's OK button two times in a row will dismiss the prompt and the page becomes usable.
* Clicking the prompt's "Cancel" or "X" buttons will instantly dismiss the authentification prompt and leave the page usable.

I don't know what this bug fixed/what are the previous expected results and the newly expected results. How exactly is this supposed to work?

As there is some work happening in [bug 613785](/show_bug.cgi?id=613785 "RESOLVED FIXED - Switch to using tab-modal prompt dialogs for HTTP authentication"), this is no longer serious enough to spend time verifying. [Bug 613785](/show_bug.cgi?id=613785 "RESOLVED FIXED - Switch to using tab-modal prompt dialogs for HTTP authentication") will actually nullify this issue completely.

Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

Cause of bug
------------
Bug is in below mentioned line of nsHttpDigestAuth::ParseChallenge method in netwerk\protocol\http\nsHttpDigestAuth.cpp file.
const char \*p = challenge + 7;
This method assumes it will received a value that starts with "Digest " for challenge variable, which has at least 7 characters.
But that assumption fails when server sends below header.
header ('WWW-Authenticate:Digest'); //Note no space after "Digest".
So adding 7 to challenge variable overflows.

I'm not sure what the rating on this should be. It looks like maybe the code ends up skipping a null terminator and ends up reading a lot of random junk? So then the main danger is information leakage.

bug\_1338876.patch
Asking for uplift, for release too.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: this code is really old.
[User impact if declined]:security impact, information leakage as explained above.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:yes and no. The code path is but this special case not.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: There are steps to reproduce in the bug.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none
[Is the change risky?]:no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:The change is really small. This code path will be call only if the challenge starts with 'digest' so setting pointer to challenge + 6 should always be correct. The following code removes white spaces if any present. So the behaviour is the same as before the patch.
[String changes made/needed]:none
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The patch shows what the problem is.
We move a pointer after a null terminator and the following code will read anything that is after that position.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Yes, the patch it self does it.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
No risk, the code is really old, so it will apply to older branches without problems.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
unlikely, it will not cause regression, also i tested it manually.

Dan, what do you think the rating on this should be? AFAICT the function is going to be searching through memory past the end of the array, but it only looks for specific substrings like "realm", and then copies stuff trailing that, so you can't really extract arbitrary information, as far as I can tell. I'm not sure if this information is passed directly back to content in any way.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

The routine will bail out if the things it finds don't match all the expected keywords. If they do it looks like it will create a response and may send the values back to the server. It might match if you have an old challenge string in memory and get lucky enough to find it, but challenge strings don't contain private information since anyone can load the server and get prompted for auth (unless maybe the server itself is inaccessible to the attacker, such as on an intranet).Group: core-security → network-core-securityFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Carsten Book, Calixte Denizet, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, David Bolter, David Keeler, Jon Coppeard, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, Tooru Fujisawa, Ben Kelly, Bob Owen, Jed Davis, Julian Seward, Julian Hector, Philipp, Markus Stange, and André Bargull reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 51. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
