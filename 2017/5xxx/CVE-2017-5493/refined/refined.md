Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the weak cryptographic security used when generating multisite activation keys in WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The vulnerability is a result of using `rand()` in the generation of the activation key, which is cryptographically weak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially predict or brute-force the activation key.
- This could lead to unauthorized access or control over a multisite network, potentially impacting multiple websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could observe the activation process and attempt to predict the weak key.
- An attacker could potentially use the weak key to take control of the multisite environment

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be aware of the signup process in a WordPress multisite installation
- An attacker would need the ability to intercept/observe the key generation process, or a means to brute-force the keys.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented involved replacing `rand()` with `wp_rand()` which is a cryptographically stronger random number generator in the signup key creation.
- The vulnerable code was located in `wp-includes/ms-functions.php`. Specifically where the blog and user signup keys are created.
- This vulnerability was resolved in WordPress version 4.7.1.
