The provided content is related to CVE-2017-5347.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code contains two instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities:
1. In `inc/lib/Control/Backend/posts.control.php`, the `$_GET['id']` parameter is directly inserted into a SQL query without sanitization.
2. In `inc/mod/newsletter/options.php`, the `$_POST['recipient']` parameter is directly inserted into a SQL query without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to:
- Unauthorized data access: Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data from the database.
- Information disclosure: Extracting database usernames, versions, and other sensitive information.
- Server compromise: In some scenarios, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve sending specially crafted HTTP requests:
1. For the first vulnerability, a GET request is sent to `gxadmin/index.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter, injecting SQL code.
2. For the second vulnerability, a POST request is sent to `gxadmin/index.php` with a manipulated `recipient` parameter, injecting SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of the application's URLs and parameters is required.
- No specific authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided content, implying that the application is either vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection or that the attacker is already authenticated.
