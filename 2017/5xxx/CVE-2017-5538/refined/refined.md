Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the Samsung Exynos GPU driver.
*   Specifically, the `kbase_dispatch` function in `mali_kbase_core_linux.c` lacks a boundary check when accessing the `temperature` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The code iterates through the `temperature` array using a user-controlled value `tskip->num_ratiometer`. If `tskip->num_ratiometer` exceeds the size of the `temperature` array (which is fixed at 10 elements), the driver will attempt to read memory outside of the bounds of the array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to memory corruption. This could potentially allow for further exploitation like privilege escalation or denial of service, but the primary concern outlined is memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the `KBASE_FUNC_TMU_SKIP` ioctl call in the GPU driver.
*   A malicious application running on the affected device could manipulate the `tskip->num_ratiometer` value provided to the ioctl call to cause the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute code on a device with the vulnerable Samsung Exynos GPU driver.
*   The attacker must be able to send ioctl commands to the GPU driver, which typically requires having the permission of the application.
*   The attacker needs to craft the `kbase_uk_tmu_skip` structure, specifically control the value of `tskip->num_ratiometer` to be larger than the allocated size of `temperature` array.

**Additional details:**

* The affected devices are M(6.0) and N(7.0) devices with Exynos AP chipsets.
* The issue was privately disclosed and patched.
* The fix involves adding a boundary check to prevent accessing memory outside of array bounds.
* The vulnerable code is located in the following file:  `<root>/drivers/gpu/arm/t7xx/r5p0/mali_kbase_core_linux.c`
* Vulnerable function: `kbase_dispatch`
* Specific code snippet:
```c
for (i = 0; i < tskip->num_ratiometer; i++) //Missing boundary check here
     if (thermistor >= tskip->temperature[i])
         t_index = i;
```
*   `tskip->temperature` is a uint32 array of 10 elements.
*   `tskip->num_ratiometer` is a user-controlled uint32.
