## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/54.0.2840.99 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Subscribe to an RSS news feed from a website in Firefox.
In certain circumstances, it is possible to inject html code by modifying the normal behavior of the RSS reader.
Original source: <https://arxiv.org/help/api/index>
Actual example: <http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=algorithms>
Example that prompts the user to Share on Facebook (you can redirect to a login impersonation page)
<http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?start=1&max_results=50&id_token=4478b9e6-d3b5-4d71-bbb4-9979a2161122-873652752266-q5rsvcuumuk3hmstnmvkmq69oucaf7q3&search_query=algorithms%3Cform%20action=%22https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+cela/0/1/0/all/0/1%22%20target=%22_blank%22%20onsubmit=%22alert(1)%22%3E%3Cinput%20type=%22image%22%20align=%22right%22%20valign=%22top%22%20width=%22200%22%20margin=%220%22%20padding=%220%22%20src=%22https://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/biopark/images/share-on-facebook.png%22%20/%3E%3C/form%3E>
Example using proper html elements of the page by adding more real content (you can redirect to a phising page)
<http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?start=1&max_results=50&id_token=4478b9e6-d3b5-4d71-bbb4-9979a2161122-873652752266-q5rsvcuumuk3hmstnmvkmq69oucaf7q3&search_query=algorithms%3Cdiv%20id=%22feedHeaderContainer1%22%3E%3Cdiv%20id=%22feedHeaderContainer%22%3E%3Cform%20action=%22https://www.mozilla.com%22%20target=%22_blank%22%20onsubmit=%22alert(1)%22%3E%20%3Cdiv%20id=%22feedSubscribeLine%22%3E%3Cfont%20size=-1%3EPuedes%20cambiar%20la%20configuraci%C3%B3n%20para%20que%20la%20barra%20de%20marcadores%20aparezca%20en%20todas%20las%20p%C3%A1ginas.%3C/font%3E%3Cbutton%20align=%22right%22%3EVer%20tus%20marcadores%3C/button%3E%3Cp%3E&nbsp;%3C/p%3E%3C/form%3E>
Another example that could recover the user and password of an email account:
<http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?start=1&max_results=50&id_token=4478b9e6-d3b5-4d71-bbb4-9979a2161122-873652752266-q5rsvcuumuk3hmstnmvkmq69oucaf7q3&search_query=algorithms%3Cdiv%20id=%22feedHeaderContainer1%22%3E%3Cdiv%20id=%22feedHeaderContainer%22%3E%3Cform%20action=%22https://www.mozilla.com%22%20target=%22_blank%22%20onsubmit=%22alert(1)%22%3E%20%3Cdiv%20id=%22feedSubscribeLine%22%3E%3Cfont%20size=-1%3EPuedes%20cambiar%20la%20configuraci%C3%B3n%20para%20que%20la%20barra%20de%20marcadores%20aparezca%20en%20todas%20las%20p%C3%A1ginas.%3C/font%3E%3Cbutton%20align=%22right%22%3EVer%20tus%20marcadores%3C/button%3E%3Cp%3E&nbsp;%3C/p%3E%3C/form%3E>
(the id\_token parameter is dummy and is used to hide the html code of the page)
With more imagination could get impressive results.
Actual results:
It is possible to inject html code by modifying the normal behavior of the RSS reader.
Expected results:
The rss manager should escape the characters sent as url parameters

Not quite cross-site scripting (did we disable script in the feed context?), but HTML injection through the feed's <title> element.
This example uses a feed that was found to echo its params, but a site could also make its own feed to do this. Mitigation: since script doesn't run it's really down to the imagination of the attacker whether they could get a user to interact with the injected elements and what that might fool the user into doing.
Interestingly, the feed in the example is escaping the attempt to inject angle brackets; loaded as raw XML the feed is safe. The feed reader code is taking &lt;&gt; and turning them back into live angle brackets! Why?!
Maybe I'm lacking imagination but for now calling this a sec-low spoof.Group: firefox-core-securityStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueKeywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Whatever the feed preview page chooses to do with it, the feed parser is doing the right thing: <title type="html">&lt;br></title> says to tell the consuming app "here's some HTML source, '<br>', do with it as you will". The &lt; is at the XML layer, you have to escape < in XML content, so an XML parser just says "you've got an element named title, with the type attribute 'html' and the content <br>."

None of this is being used. The feedwriter code (which constructs the dynamic portion of the contents of subscribe.xhtml) calls createDocumentFragment - not the DOM one, but a custom one defined here: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b548da4e16f067e5b69349376e37b2db97983cf7/toolkit/components/feeds/FeedProcessor.js#612-630> which uses parserUtils to parse the contents as HTML.
This very much looks like it's a deliberate decision in order to preserve markup in feeds, so just using the text will almost certainly break real-world sites (inasmuch as RSS is still a thing).
We can drop forms by using better sanitize flags. I'm kind of surprised that dropping forms isn't the nsIParserUtils default (ie allowing style/script is opt-in, but apparently allowing forms is opt-out - it's not clear to me \*why\*...).

So, just to explain: I decided rendering html in the title and subtitle of the feed, as well as the title of entries in the feed, was pointless, so I disabled it. The only place we continue to show HTML is in the feed entry content, where we now strip form elements and a number of other things.

So apparently people put in actual work to make HTML work in the titles here, see [bug 436801](/show_bug.cgi?id=436801 "RESOLVED FIXED - XHTML not properly supported in Feed titles"). I don't really mind what we do - we can update the test, or we can make the code allow markup and strip forms and some other stuff (changes which the patch already includes) and hope nobody finds yet another way of abusing the limited set of HTML allowed.

Cool, so this is intentional and goes through the sanitizer -- that's good to hear and we can unhide this.
Forms are spoofy and hard to imagine are used or wanted in feeds; definitely not in titles. I'd still like to sanitize forms away but we can live with the rest. You don't want to use SanitizerCidEmbedsOnly -- that's for email and will result in no images in the feed, and people clearly want those. I don't think we need to use SanitizerDropNonCSSPresentation either.Group: firefox-core-securityFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---) → [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)See Also: → [436801](/show_bug.cgi?id=436801 "RESOLVED FIXED - XHTML not properly supported in Feed titles")

Also take note that you can generate video elements which can go full screen with no user interaction required(or warnings about).
This could be used to recreate the browser in its entirety and possibly do some very nice phishing and other nastiness.

Er, how (without script)?

How? You can't overlay on the fullscreen <video> element so there's no way to get user input, and you can't run script (in the RSS feed reader, anyway).
But a fullscreen video element can be accomplished without the rss reader, and at that point none of the rest of the RSS reader is visible anymore, so I don't see the point of channeling this through the RSS reader.
The point here is that in theory you could use the context of the RSS reader in order for the user to give you more trust in a form displayed in it or whatever. So the <video> stuff seems completely orthogonal, because you are no longer abusing the trust that's part of the RSS reader's content.

I agree with Gijs, it is not possible to execute javascript code in rss reader.
In my opinion, the insertion of the form inside a gold colored box offers some credibility being able to persuade the user to enter their credentials but there are no other html elements likely to be misleading in the context of the RSS reader.

To correct myself, once in full screen video mode there is no warnings or confirmation that it is fullscreen. I would assume clickjacking could be used to get the video full screen, but yes it is not automatic, just worrisome. Apparently about: pages are trusted with media to some degree.

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

As an anti-self-XSS feature (where people are lured into hacking themselves, typically their social media accounts) we remove the javascript: scheme when people paste URLs into the Location bar. We should be doing the same for drag and drop, which is also used for the same kinds of self-xss attacks.
At least we don't execute the javascript: url when dropped so it's not terrible, but it leaves the victim one innocuous-sounding instruction ('hit return') away from the same result.

I don't think it makes sense to prevent javascript: URLs from dropping to the URL bar. If the attacker can generate a link on the page, he can just instruct victims to click the link.

1) not all cases where the attacker can provide text to dnd also allow said attacker to generate "real" links
2) there are subtle behavioural differences between pasting a URL and then hitting enter, versus clicking a link. Those differences can be abused. We should avoid that being (easily) possible.

<https://reviewboard.mozilla.org/r/93504/#review93948>
It's unfortunate we allow to drop data: here, otherwise we could just pass disallowInherit to dropLinks and it would automatically cancel the event and throw... It would be much simpler.

This comment is confusing, what are "the bits", and what has pasting to do with a drop? The comment should not assume that one has to check what the other consumers do... Please rewrite it specifically for drop.
The possibilities here are 2:
1. drop the url without javascript. I don't se the point in doing this, the cut url would make no sense.
2. do nothing, that is what this patch is doing.
But honestly we could handle this better from a UI feedback point of view, in onDragOver we could check dropLinks and if the url is a javascript url, we could set aEvent.dataTransfer.dropEffect = "none", so the user gets a no-drop indicator. Not doing this means the user drops the link and nothing happens, that is not great.
The code can be refactored to go through a common method in both dragover and drop.

I think it should actually be set in all the cases where we return null.. I'd indeed move this to onDragOver as:
if (!this.\_getDroppableLink(aEvent)) {
aEvent.dataTransfer.dropEffect = "none";
}
that would make it clearer what we do (just invoking this.\_getDroppableLink sounds like a no-op without looking into its implementation)
In the drop case you should not need it cause it will take the last value set by dragover.

This got automated coverage in [bug 1320502](/show_bug.cgi?id=1320502 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Paste and Go\" does not work if CRLF exists at the end of clipboard url."), and there were a few regressions reported and fixed already, so I guess it being high profile and having automated coverage mean additional QA is unlikely to uncover new things.
