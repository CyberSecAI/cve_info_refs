Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5390:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The JSON Viewer in Firefox's Developer Tools uses insecure methods to send data (JSON or HTTP headers) between the content scope and the chrome scope, making it vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks. Specifically, `Cu.exportFunction` was used to expose the `postChromeMessage` function to content, which then allowed for arbitrary code to be executed in the chrome context.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure communication channel between content and chrome scopes due to usage of `Cu.exportFunction`.
- Exposure of internal functions to the content scope, enabling unauthorized access.
- Lack of proper validation for incoming messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to:
- Achieve privilege escalation, executing code with chrome level access
- Potentially access sensitive information or execute arbitrary code on the user's machine
- Bypass the browser's sandbox and potentially interact with the operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious website could use the vulnerable JSON viewer component to inject and execute malicious code into the chrome scope.
- The exploitation does not require any specific actions beyond normal browsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have their malicious code loaded into a content scope (a website).
- Requires knowledge of the vulnerable interface and how to send messages that will trigger chrome code execution.
- The attacker needs to induce the user to open the vulnerable JSON viewer.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by replacing the `postChromeMessage` function with window listeners and a custom event.
- The fix involved also adding checks to ensure the document is actually a json viewer document.
- The fix was applied to Firefox ESR 45.7, 51 and later.
- The severity of this vulnerability was rated as high, requiring security approval before landing.
- Jerri Rice is credited with reporting this vulnerability.
- There is reference to another bug [bug 1333210](show_bug.cgi?id=1333210), which is described as a follow-up to this issue.
