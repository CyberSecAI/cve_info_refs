Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5789:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `mxdr_string()` function within the `libxdrutil.dll` library. This library is used by HPE LoadRunner and HPE Performance Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient input validation:** The `mxdr_string()` function does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a heap-based buffer.
- **Integer overflow leading to heap overflow:** A specially crafted XDR string with a very large length (e.g., `0xfffffffc`) is processed in `libxdrutil.dll!mxdr_string()`. When allocating the buffer, the function ends up allocating only 1 byte instead of a larger buffer as intended. When the function tries to copy `0xfffffffc` bytes of attacker-controlled data into this 1-byte buffer, a heap buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution (RCE):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system under the context of the current process.
- This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Unauthenticated:** Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker crafts a malicious XDR string with a large length to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of HPE LoadRunner or HPE Performance Center.
- The attacker does not need to have any credentials to initiate the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tenable.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) script was created by Tenable to demonstrate the issue.
- HPE released patches (Patch 4) for both HPE LoadRunner and HPE Performance Center to address this vulnerability. Versions prior to Patch 4 are assumed to be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 by Tenable and 6.8 by ZDI, while a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 was assigned by Tenable.
