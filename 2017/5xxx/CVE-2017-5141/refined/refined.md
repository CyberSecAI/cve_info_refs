The content is related to CVE-2017-5141.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a session fixation issue. The application allows an attacker to establish a new user session without invalidating any existing session identifier.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Session Fixation (CWE-384). The application does not properly invalidate existing session identifiers when a new session is established, allowing for session hijacking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially steal authenticated user sessions by establishing a new session and using the established session to impersonate the victim. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system and potentially manipulation of configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by manipulating the session handling mechanisms of the web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system and, according to the CVSS vector, requires high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
