Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5554:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an unsafe `fastboot oem` command in the OnePlus 3 and 3T bootloader, specifically the `fastboot oem selinux permissive` command.
- This command is available even when the bootloader is locked.
- OnePlus modified Android's init to honor the "androidboot.selinux" flag even for production ROM builds. In standard Android builds, this flag is ignored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unsafe Fastboot Command:** The `fastboot oem selinux permissive` command should not be available on locked devices, but it is.
- **Bootloader Modification:** OnePlus modified the Android init process to recognize and honor the "androidboot.selinux" kernel command-line argument which is typically ignored in production builds.
- **Lack of SELinux Status Display:** The devices lack a display of the current SELinux state in the 'About Screen', making it difficult for users to know if their device is compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **SELinux Permissive Mode:** An attacker can use the command to switch SELinux from *Enforcing* to *Permissive* mode.
- **Weakened Security:** Permissive mode significantly weakens the device's security, making it easier for malware and other exploits to gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges.
- **Persistent Change:** The change to SELinux permissive mode persists across reboots, unlike other methods that require root access, and it doesn't require root access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the device can reboot it into fastboot mode by pressing the Volume Up button during boot.
- **ADB Access:** An attacker with ADB (Android Debug Bridge) access can reboot the device into fastboot mode using the command `adb reboot bootloader`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical access** to the device or **remote access to an ADB connection** to the device
- Ability to reboot the device into fastboot mode.
- Ability to send fastboot commands through USB interface.
