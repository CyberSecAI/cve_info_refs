| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1411811#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-10 14:46:44 UTC  ```  When executing a program via the bubblewrap sandbox, the nonpriv session can escape to the parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the terminal's input buffer, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox.  References:  <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850702>  Upstream bugs:  <https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap/issues/142> <https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap/pull/143>  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap/commit/d7fc532c42f0e9bf427923bab85433282b3e5117>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1411811#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-10 14:47:24 UTC  ``` Created bubblewrap tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1411815](show_bug.cgi?id=1411815 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-5226 bubblewrap: Nonprivileged session can escape to the parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1411814](show_bug.cgi?id=1411814 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2017-5226 bubblewrap: Nonprivileged session can escape to the parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1411811#c2)  Colin Walters    2018-05-31 14:00:42 UTC  ``` We decided not to change bubblewrap for this; see <https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap/pull/150>  Effectively it's something software which *uses* flatpak has to choose how to handle.  (Also really the kernel should make it easy to disallow)   ``` |  |

Message-ID: <ZBQ5Z9wfWqONphtz@momentum.pseudorandom.co.uk>

Subject: flatpak: CVE-2023-28100: TIOCLINUX can send commands outside sandbox
 if running on a virtual console

<https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7qpw-3vjv-xrqp>
Vulnerable: all < 1.10.8, 1.12.x < 1.12.8, 1.14.x < 1.14.4, 1.15.x < 1.15.4
Fixed: 1.15.4, 1.14.x >= 1.14.4, 1.12.x >= 1.12.8, 1.10.x >= 1.10.8

Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
desktop applications on Linux.

Jakub Wilk mentioned on the oss-security mailing list that various
projects' mitigations for the problematic design of the TIOCSTI ioctl
are not sufficient in all cases, because Linux virtual terminals
implement copy/paste via the TIOCLINUX ioctl, which can have a similar
effect. Flatpak is one of the projects affected by this.

If a malicious Flatpak app is run on a Linux virtual console such as
/dev/tty1, it can copy text from the virtual console and paste it back
into the virtual console's input buffer, from which the command might
be run by the user's shell after the Flatpak app has exited. This is
similar to CVE-2017-5226, but using the TIOCLINUX ioctl command instead
of TIOCSTI.

This has been fixed in Flatpak upstream releases 1.14.4, 1.15.4, 1.12.8
and 1.10.8 by preventing the TIOCLINUX ioctl via a seccomp filter,
in the same way that was already done for the TIOCSTI ioctl.

Mitigation: ordinary graphical terminal emulators like xterm,
gnome-terminal and Konsole are unaffected. This vulnerability is specific
to the Linux virtual consoles /dev/tty1, /dev/tty2 and so on, which are
not commonly used to run Flatpak apps: Flatpak is primarily designed
to be used in a Wayland or X11 graphical environment, either with no
controlling terminal (the most common case) or from a graphical terminal
emulator (while debugging or developing).

Workaround: avoid running untrusted Flatpak apps (`flatpak run ...`)
from the text-mode virtual consoles.

```

Call setsid() before executing sandboxed code ([CVE-2017-5226](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m28g-vfcm-85ff "CVE-2017-5226"))

```
This prevents the sandboxed code from getting a controlling tty,
which in turn prevents it from accessing the TIOCSTI ioctl and hence
faking terminal input.

## Description

When executing a program via the bubblewrap sandbox, the nonpriv session can escape to the parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the terminal's input buffer, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

I don't know who assigned the CVE ID or whether the bug reporter has made any attempt to report it upstream already.

Subject: TTY pushback vulnerabilities / TIOCSTI

Hi,

This blogpost highlights TTY Pushback vulnerabilities enabled via the
TIOCSTI kernel functionality available in the Linux kernel:
<https://www.errno.fr/TTYPushback.html>

This has been discussed here previously:
<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/03/9>

Though I think there are some noteworthy updates. In the 2017 post
solar designer mentioned that the Linux kernel developers have multiple
times rejected changes in the kernel. However this has now changed:
Starting with Kernel 6.2 it is possible to disable TIOCSTI
(unset CONFIG_LEGACY_TIOCSTI). It also appears that very few (or no?)
applications practically use TIOCSTI.

This seems to be the only real mitigation for this issue. It appears
su has a parameter, and in sudo one can configure the creation of a new
pty in the sudoers file. I don't consider these as satisfying fixes, as
they are optinal, and thus rely on the expectation that users are aware
of this risk and manually use these mitigations. That does not seem
realistic to me.

This also affects such a large number of tools, not just
su/sudo-like tools, but also sandboxing tools. E.g. bubblewrap [1] is
affected by this by default.

Thus I strongly recommend that people disable this in the kernel.

    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to a
    cross site scripting attack. Description: An input validation issue
    was addressed with improved input validation.

CVE-2020-9850
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK before 2.28.3 and WPE WebKit before 2.28.3

    Impact: A remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code
    execution. Description: A logic issue was addressed with improved
    restrictions.

CVE-2020-13753
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK before 2.28.3 and WPE WebKit before 2.28.3
    Credit to Milan Crha at Red Hat.
    The bubblewrap sandbox of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit, prior to 2.28.3,
    failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI
    ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER could potentially be used to confuse xdg-
    desktop-portal, which allows access outside the sandbox. TIOCSTI can
    be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox by writing
    to the controlling terminal's input buffer, similar to
    CVE-2017-5226.

We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE
WebKit. It is the best way to ensure that you are running safe versions
of WebKit. Please check our websites for information about the latest
stable releases.
