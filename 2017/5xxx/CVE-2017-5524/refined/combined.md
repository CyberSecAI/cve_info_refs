Use CVE-2017-5524.

The scope of this CVE does not include the "reflected Cross Site
Scripting attack (XSS) in the ZMI (manage_findResult)" mentioned on
the PloneHotfix20170117 page. If that still needs a CVE ID, please let
us know.

In the <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/> post,
the exploitation scenarios are:

>     untrusted translators on string files. This is a big one because
>     many applications that are translated into multiple languages will
>     use new-style Python string formatting and not everybody will vet
>     all the strings that come in.

We do not feel that a CVE would have been needed if this were the only
exploitation scenario. We do not think there is a security boundary
between "people who can contribute arbitrary code to a product" and
"people who can contribute code that expresses translations." However,
it is possible that an open-source project exists somewhere with a
completely untrusted channel for translators.

>     user exposed configuration. One some systems users might be
>     permitted to configure some behavior and that might be exposed as
>     format strings. In particular I have seen it where users can
>     configure notification mails, log message formats or other basic
>     templates in web applications.

This one seems completely valid, and might be the primary exploitation
scenario for CVE-2017-5524.
