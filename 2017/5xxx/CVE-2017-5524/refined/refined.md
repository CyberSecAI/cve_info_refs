Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of the `str.format` method in Plone's through-the-web templates and scripts. The `str.format` method allows for string interpolation, which can be exploited if the format string or the arguments passed to it are not properly sanitized, specifically when using untrusted input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unsanitized input:** The core weakness is the lack of sanitization of format strings or the data used in string formatting, making the system vulnerable to injection attacks.
- **Use of `str.format`:** The `str.format` method in Python, while powerful, allows for dynamic evaluation of code if the format string contains placeholders that can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sandbox escape:** Attackers can escape the intended sandbox environment by crafting malicious format strings.
- **Access to private content:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to private content by exploiting the vulnerability in templates and scripts.
- **Code execution:** While not explicitly mentioned, crafted format strings might lead to arbitrary code execution in some specific scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Through-the-web templates and scripts:** Attackers can inject malicious format strings into templates or scripts accessed through the web interface.
- **User-exposed configuration:** User-configurable elements, such as notification emails, log message formats, or other basic templates, can be exploited by using format strings.
- **Untrusted translators on string files:**  Though less likely, an attacker could introduce malicious code via translation files if these files are not properly vetted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to contribute arbitrary code:** An attacker needs to be in a position where they can influence the content of templates, scripts, user-exposed configurations, or potentially translation strings. This could be:
    - A user with permissions to modify templates or configuration settings.
    - An external attacker able to inject malicious data through a vulnerable interface.

**Summary**

CVE-2017-5524 arises from the insecure use of Python's `str.format` method within the Plone CMS. By injecting malicious format strings into templates, scripts, or configurations, attackers can bypass security restrictions (sandbox escape) and potentially gain unauthorized access to private data and code execution. The primary attack vector involves user-exposed configurations and through-the-web templates/scripts.
