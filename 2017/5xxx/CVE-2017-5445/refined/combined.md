| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

overflows and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, information disclosure or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.9.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.9.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

[CVE-2016-6354](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-6354)
Some versions of The Fast Lexical Analyzer contain a bug which causes it to produce code potentially vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
While the fix should be made upstream (CMU Sphinx and ANGLE) in the first place, it might be a good idea to apply this hotfix for now.

I know that part :) This is an ANGLE change - do we land in Gecko code, then request an upstream change, or do we wait for the upstream change, what do we do with our github branch of ANGLE code in the meantime, there is a few extra moving parts.Flags: needinfo?(milan) → needinfo?(jgilbert)

Sorry this went a off my radar - we just do carry the attached patch.

Um, I'm clearly missing a lot here - where do JS strings enter this (I'm not saying they are not, just being curious).
> Use int64\_t.
Point taken, yet as this is automatically generated code, I would tend to think it should be addressed either in Flex itself or its input data (parser definition).
In addition, changing type from 32 bit to 64 might (I think) have unexpected side-effects once there is an assignment from <int64\_t> to <int32\_t>. IIRC the result (if the former doesn't fit the latter) is implementation defined. I'm not sure off the top of my head whether this really is "implementation defined" or "undefined behaviour", but even the first one doesn't sound like something desirable.Flags: needinfo?(pcerny)

For the most part, the code hasn't changed. Tokenizer.cpp was updated to match what this patch has, the other two files have been left untouched. Either way, what we have in the repo still doesn't look safe.

mozilla-flex\_buffer\_overrun.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
medium-hard
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
no
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Shouldn't need separate backports. Trivial to write if needed.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
very low; has testing upstream.

The Tokenizer.cpp hunk was unnecessary on trunk as that change appears to already be there. We'll need to take care to double-check other branches when doing uplifts rather than simply grafting what landed on m-c. Speaking of which, please request Aurora/Beta/ESR52/ESR45 approval on this as soon as possible :)

#### [#CVE-2017-5429: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 53, Firefox ESR 45.9, and Firefox ESR 52.1](#CVE-2017-5429)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous, David Baron, Mats Palmgren, Ronald Crane, Bob Clary, and Chris Peterson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Attached file

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8843567&action=edit)

Steps to reproduce:
--------------------
1. Build firefox with valgrind using instructions mentioned in
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Testing/Valgrind>
2. Download and copy httpindex1.php and httpindex2.php to local web server.
Web server should support PHP.
3. Start firefox
\* Enable Multi-process option should be disabled in firefox.
Otherwise firefox tab crash due to some other valgrind errors.
export VALGRIND\_OPTIONS="--smc-check=all-non-file --vex-iropt-register-updates=allregs-at-mem-access --show-mismatched-frees=no --read-inline-info=yes"
./mach run --debugger="valgrind" --debugger-args="$VALGRIND\_OPTIONS"
4. Visit httpindex1.php or httpindex2.php
Valgrind will display error. Valgrind output is attached under Crash Signature.
Cause of bug
-------------
Bug is in nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method of netwerk\streamconv\converters\nsDirIndexParser.cpp file.
"mFormat" int array created by this method can contain uninitialized value due to 2 reasons.
1. "http-index-format" content does not contain any format values.
ex: 200:\r\n
201:a\r\n
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method creates an int array with 2 elements for "mFormat", even though there are no values in format line.
2. "http-index-format" content contains invalid values.
ex: 200:a a a
201:a a a
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method creates an int array with 4 elements for "mFormat", even though there are invalid values in format line.

I checked again and commit was present.
Test case does not crash Firefox. But Valgrind shows "uninitialised value" error.
Valgrind shows this error only when "Enable multi-process Nightly" option is disabled.
But I don't think is bug is related to "Multi-process" option.

Comment on new test case (httpindex3.php)
-----------------------------------------
Bug fix (Below mentioned) correctly fixes initially attached test cases (httpindex1.php and httpindex2.php).
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method ->
mFormat[num] = -1;
+ mFormat[0] = -1; // to detect zero header fields
nsDirIndexParser::ParseData mehtod ->
+ if (mFormat[0] == -1) {
+ // no known header fields is an error
+ return NS\_ERROR\_ILLEGAL\_VALUE;
+ }
But fix can be bypassed, when first format value is valid and following format values are invalid.
ex:
<?php
header("Content-Type:application/http-index-format");
echo "200:Filename a a\r\n";
echo "201:a a a\r\n";
?>Flags: needinfo?(chamalsl)

[0001-bug-1344467-clear-the-format-type-for-unknown-types-.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8850534&action=diff) (obsolete)

Thanks for the additional data.
The mFormat[] array that is filled in with identifier integers could end up with uninitialized array entries if a correct header field was followed by an incorrect one. This patch now sets all types to -1 first so that a mismatch will leave it initialized to the "unknown" type.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Hard. It is easy to cause an access of uninitialized memory, but hard to take advantage of.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not very clearly, no
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This bug has been around in all code since October 2001.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The same patch should work on all branches
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Low risk due to the small size and minimal logical change.

[v2-0001-bug-1344467-clear-the-format-type-for-unknown-typ.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8853311&action=diff) (obsolete)

Here's take 2. The previous version could still break out of the loop before the assignment and then cause reads of uninitialized data. I feel rather confident with this version.
There's try run going at <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=4cbdc417d41a93eadd61c89d745c763b1a7b7fdd&selectedJob=87789473> which unfortunately has an unusually large amount of intermittents.

Attached patch

[v3-0001-bug-1344467-clear-the-format-type-for-unknown-typ.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8853377&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8853377&action=edit)

Take 3.
Turns out fixing this bug triggered a different flow later on that caused test regressions. nsDirIndexParser::ParseData() really can't be allowed to return failure even for bad input as that then skips the necessary call to mListener->OnIndexAvailable().
This version of the patch makes changes ParseData() to still return on bad input, but return NS\_OK.
Try run, with the changes visible as two different commits before I squashed them: <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=78085bfac800d91ea23963293ea5b256b34a5d83>

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
