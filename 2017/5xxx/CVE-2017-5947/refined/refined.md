- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to force OnePlus devices into Qualcomm Emergency Download (EDL) mode through ADB (`adb reboot edl`) or a hardware key combination (Volume-UP while connected to USB). This EDL mode, when combined with leaked Firehose programmers for the respective devices, allows for direct access and manipulation of critical partitions.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unprotected access to EDL mode through ADB and hardware key combinations
    - Leaked Firehose programmers for OnePlus devices.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use leaked Firehose programmers to downgrade critical partitions such as the Android Bootloader. This can enable exploitation of older vulnerabilities that were previously patched or allow for complete device takeover. The attacker can potentially gain root access, install malware, or modify device firmware.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - ADB command (`adb reboot edl`)
    - Hardware key combination (Volume-UP + USB connection)
    - Access to leaked firehose programmers for the target device

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Physical access to the device via USB.
    - ADB debugging enabled (for the `adb reboot edl` vector).
    - Access to leaked Firehose programmers corresponding to the target device.
    - Knowledge of how to use the programmers to flash or modify the device's partitions.
