Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-5345 (Based on the issue #60 reference)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user input in the `inc/lib/Control/Ajax/tags-ajax.control.php` file, specifically within the SQL query used to fetch tags. The `$_GET['term']` parameter is directly embedded into the SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Because the `$_GET['term']` parameter is directly included in the SQL query, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data modification, or other malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or even gain control over the database server.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Although not directly stated, depending on the database configuration and the capabilities of the database user, it might be possible to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the database.
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker could access information that is not intended for public access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/code-src/GeniXCMS/GeniXCMS-master/` endpoint, specifically targeting the `ajax=tags` parameter.
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `term` parameter in the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
- **No Authentication Required:** Based on the provided exploit, no prior authentication seems necessary to trigger this vulnerability, although the `User::access(2)` check seems to be in place, which should limit the exploit to at least Editor level users, but this is not properly sanitizing the input.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is in `/inc/lib/Control/Ajax/tags-ajax.control.php`:
  ```php
  if (isset($_GET['token']) && Token::isExist($_GET['token'])) {
    if (User::access(2)) {
        $tags = Db::result(
            "SELECT * FROM `cat` WHERE `type` = 'tag' AND `name` LIKE '".$_GET['term']."%' ORDER BY `name` ASC"
        );
  ```
- The provided exploit is:
  `GET /code-src/GeniXCMS/GeniXCMS-master/?ajax=tags&token=vv4lHNZit2KJUJEIqUKn3S1CRvr5Wb8smp6ir3ujyj7iijC6t0GvfpLgSW0a3xGicHSXTH6IW1BCeUlt&term=a'%20and%20updatexml(1,(select+USER()),1)%23`
  This shows the attacker using SQL injection to call `updatexml` and get the database user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit log indicates a "Security Fix Issue" related to this vulnerability.
- The patch includes changes in multiple files, indicating a broader fix effort related to security issues.
