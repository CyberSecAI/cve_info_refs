Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5648:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of application listener calls within Apache Tomcat. Specifically, when running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it was possible for the application to retain references to request or response objects. These retained references could then be used to access and modify information associated with other web applications running within the same Tomcat instance. This violates the intended isolation between web applications enforced by the SecurityManager.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Incorrect object handling**: Application listener calls are not using the appropriate facade objects, leading to the possibility of access to underlying request/response objects.
-   **Bypassing SecurityManager**: Untrusted applications can circumvent the protection mechanisms of the SecurityManager, allowing access to resources they shouldn't be able to touch.
-   **Reference retention**: Untrusted applications can retain references to request and response objects, even after the intended scope of those objects should have ended.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could access sensitive information of other web applications.
-   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker could modify data of other web applications.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** In some contexts, access to other web application resources might lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Remote:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by deploying a malicious web application on a vulnerable Tomcat server.
-   **Local**: A malicious application already running within Tomcat under a `SecurityManager` context can exploit this vulnerability.
-   **Network** The vulnerability can be exploited through network traffic in the form of HTTP requests made to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to deploy or execute a web application on the vulnerable Tomcat instance. If the application is untrusted, it needs to be running under a SecurityManager.
-   No authentication is explicitly stated in the description for the remote attack, suggesting it might be exploitable without prior authentication.
-   The attacker needs a good understanding of Tomcat's internal workings.

**Additional Notes:**

- Several sources mention that the vulnerability allows for "access and/or modify information associated with another web application," implying a cross-application attack.
- Patches are available for multiple affected versions of Tomcat, as well as for derived products.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Important" by Red Hat.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 by NetApp.
- The vulnerability is also referred to as a "Security constrained bypass" in some documents.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry explicitly states "Calls to application listeners did not use the appropriate facade object".

The Debian Security Advisories (DSA 3842-1 and DSA 3843-1) also provide useful information:
- "Some application listeners calls were issued against the wrong objects, allowing untrusted applications running under a SecurityManager to bypass that protection mechanism and access or modify information associated with other web applications."

This information is more descriptive than the description provided in the CVE placeholder.
