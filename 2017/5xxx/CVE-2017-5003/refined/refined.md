Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-5003:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle, RSA Via Lifecycle and Governance, and RSA IMG products.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML into a user's browser session.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML in a user's browser session within the context of the affected system. This could lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated, meaning the attacker does not need prior access to the system and can initiate the attack over the network. The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with a malicious link or content containing the injected script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request containing the XSS payload. They also require the target user to interact with this malicious request (e.g., by clicking a link).
