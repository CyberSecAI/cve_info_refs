{
  "CVE-2017-5466": {
    "description": "If a page is loaded from an original site through a hyperlink and contains a redirect to a `data:text/html` URL, triggering a reload will run the reloaded `data:text/html` page with its origin set incorrectly. This allows for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of the origin when a page containing a redirect to a `data:text/html` URL is reloaded. Specifically, the reloaded page inherits the origin of the original site instead of being isolated with a blank origin as intended for data URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect origin handling during redirects",
      "Failure to properly isolate data URLs"
    ],
    "impact": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, enabling an attacker to execute malicious scripts within the context of another website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A page from an original site contains a hyperlink to an attacker-controlled site",
      "The attacker-controlled site redirects to a `data:text/html` URL",
      "User reloads the `data:text/html` URL, which then inherits the origin of the original site"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a server to which the user's browser navigates. This server will redirect to a `data:text/html` URL. The attacker needs the user to perform a reload operation on the `data:text/html` URL.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises during the reloading of a data:text/html URL when the browser incorrectly inherits the origin from a previous page, rather than setting the origin to null."
