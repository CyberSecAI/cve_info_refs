##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Jan de Mooij, Tom Schuster, and Oriol reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

JSON viewer uses `Cu.exportFunction` to export `postChromeMessage` method into content scope to create a communication channel (used for, copying & saving JSON data and HTTP headers from the content).
This should be replaced by window listeners.

Ok I've identified the key points to replace, what would in fact be the proper way to pass objects through event listeners, or does someone else have an idea here? I'll leave it this for now, with the rest of the work relating to this in place I'm somewhat hesitant to change anything yet.

I guess I'll try to implement JSON.stringify for passing objects. I'll contact you on IRC Honza, just to see if you have anything already going in this direction.
I did test the other defense in depth patches regarding this and they seem solid as of right now. Let's hope no regressions break things =)

Do we think we need the JSON-ification for safety? Otherwise, I would have thought we could just pass the object directly on the event's detail property - is there some reason that doesn't work?

I guess it would, I discussed this with Honza and now that I'm thinking about it that is probably the better solution. I was stuck on how to have JSON parse the received object back without security issues anyway.
I'm still trying to get a source building setup right, any chance you can give that a try Gijs?

Thanks Jerri for working on this! I believe that this is going the right direction.
I know this is just a testing patch, but I put made some comments inline...
And, yeah, agree with Gijs, passing direct object would be better if safe.

After this patch, running debug mode when the json-viewer content renders on screen the console window lights up with this error.
[Child 3176] ###!!! ASSERTION: This is unsafe! Fix the caller!: 'Error', file c:
/Users/[redacted]/mozilla-central/dom/events/EventDispatcher.cpp, line 673
I'm going to file a follow up bug and leave the number here so we can discuss if this is actually a security issue or if the assertion is misleading considering the security measures here.
Maybe the event listener needs to check the event source, but I feel that too can be done in follow up bug. Will post the follow up bug here in a second and leave the bug number here and we can go from there.

Done very strange since I was sure I added you at first. Also I used to have the spacing guidelines down, but I usually don't contribute code here, just break it :)

Jan, could you possibly fix the spacing problems? I'm not going to have the bandwidth or the system it would take to do it properly since I'm kind of with family for right now. I also don't think this should be held back any longer due to some standards like ISO coding standards holding it back.
Thanks I hope, if not I can do it soon. The functionality is there though :-)

I didn't go back over the guidelines, but IIRC something like this is more what you're wanting right.
Sorry, I tend to be a little rough around the edges, but I think this should serve you well for review.

I also have an alternate version of this patch with spacing the only other way I think it could make sense if this one isn't right. Just let me know, killing my data setting these tools up though =/

Here I believe the spacing is pretty spot on. I'm a little low on data now though and kind of in the middle of nowhere lol.
Thank for looking this over Honza. I think it takes care of all of our concerns about exporting postChromeMessage.
Happy Holidays and cheers all.

Should we verify that we're still on a JSON viewer document somehow, to be very safe? Note also e.g. [bug 1044586 comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1044586#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - F5 key breaks about:preferences") and further. We should be very sure that if you e.g.:
myWin = window.open("some json", "\_blank")
myWin.location.href = "my evil code that fires these custom events so that the converter child will then do stuff with chrome"
wouldn't work.

We're duplicating this 3 times - we could create a helper to make this cleaner?
Either in the helper or all 3 times, please leave a trailing comma after the value prop, and just use the ES6 shorthand instead of duplicating "value: value"

I'd push this into the helper, passing the helper values for "type" and "value", and then just calling it with 2 args to make 'type' and 'value' happen.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
This is hard to estimate, but this comment can help:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1295309#c24](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295309#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - In the newest nightly builds, its possible to partially load dev tools at content level.")
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Target Milestone for JSON viewer (introducing the original implementation) was Firefox 44. I am not sure about affected branches.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
The JSON Viewer has been introduced in [Bug 1132203](/show_bug.cgi?id=1132203 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON response viewer")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
They are no backports. They could be probably the same and representing low risk.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Low risk. All affected JSON Viewer features have been manually tested and they are also covered by automated tests.

I'll try to fix these failures, getting a nice text editor with an es lint plugin setup in windows right now. Don't let me step on your toes here though Honza.
Will be in touch, although I'm not sure I have try server access ;-)

Here is a patch to apply after the above patch which should take care of es lint warnings. At least I hope, tried to redo the whole thing only to realize the previous patch has landed =/
Hope this helps guys, sorry if this makes it more of a mess.

It looks as though the es lint problems were solved, but for right now I do see one mochi devtools chrome test failing.
Can someone else take a look and see what they think here? hmm

The retriggers were green and the test seems unrelated, so I don't expect it's an issue to do with this patch.

I can't speak for Honza and I know that there is a protocol, but nothing in the patch was modified in any real way.
A comment was removed, and a space before a parentheses was removed.
I'll let him follow up.

[bug1297361](/show_bug.cgi?id=1297361 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON Viewer: use listeners instead of exporting postChromeMessage").patch
Re-requesting sec-approval (already approved in [comment #41](/show_bug.cgi?id=1297361#c41 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON Viewer: use listeners instead of exporting postChromeMessage")).
@abillings: the patch has been updated to fix eslint warnings. A comment was removed, and a space before a parentheses was removed.
Honza
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
This is hard to estimate, but this comment can help:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1295309#c24](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295309#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - In the newest nightly builds, its possible to partially load dev tools at content level.")
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Target Milestone for JSON viewer (introducing the original implementation) was Firefox 44. I am not sure about affected branches.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
The JSON Viewer has been introduced in [Bug 1132203](/show_bug.cgi?id=1132203 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON response viewer")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
They are no backports. They could be probably the same and representing low risk.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Low risk. All affected JSON Viewer features have been manually tested and they are also covered by automated tests.

I believe there may be a bit of a blunder here. While trying to test for a stacktrace for [bug 1330173](/show_bug.cgi?id=1330173 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE") I thought wouldn't it be interesting to try to load the json viewer in a tab.
This still works for top level windows, and a point I believe was missed originally was that if you load it into a top level window, that window remains fully accessible from the content window that opened it.
I'll probably make another bug to handle that, but in everything that happened here I did forget to continue to stress that one point.
So if the patches here don't check for trusted events(will look it all over again in a second) the fact that the window is accessible could still be a hole.
Man this is kind of a mess, because I'm on limited time and I keep finding more things to dig into. I don't want to leave any of them hanging. Will follow up after dedicated a few hours to [bug 1330173](/show_bug.cgi?id=1330173 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE").

Ok yeah, the patch here is lacking. If someone with the proper bugzilla rights can strike my previous comment and possibly even this one, this can go ahead and go public and we can handle the window being accessible in another bug.
Sorry guys I slipped a little on this one. I remember mentioning it in the bug that this bug was spawned from but I forgot to continue to stress that key point.
Now I know how Gijs has felt about some of those regressions. Sorry man, but when we all work together we can find things like this much easier :-)

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Jan de Mooij, Tom Schuster, and Oriol reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 45.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

                 CVE-2017-5410

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code or information leaks.

With this update, the Icedove packages are de-branded back to the official
Mozilla branding. With the removing of the Debian branding the packages
are also renamed back to the official names used by Mozilla.

The Thunderbird package is using a different default profile folder,
the default profile folder is now '$(HOME)/.thunderbird'.
The users profile folder, that was used in Icedove, will get migrated
to the new profile folder on the first start, that can take a little bit
more time.

Please read README.Debian for getting more information about the
changes.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.8.0-3~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0 SeaMonkey/2.46
Build ID: 20161229190117
Steps to reproduce:
Download the attached mp4 video file and create an iframe tag with the src pointing to it,
then removing the iframe nodes and doing a document.write in the main window right after can cause the media resource
chanel used to download the mp4 to be freed and reused in a short time inside this new document.
It doesn't crash if using timers or events so I had to wait in an alert or sync XMLHttpRequestt for the object deletion,
apparently as stated here <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/MediaResource.h#438>, it can only be
accessed from the main thread.
I'm reproducing it waiting 10 seconds before closing the alert, it's an arbitrary time. The basic idea is that it only continues
execution after a call to MediaResource::Destroy().
Using the testcase it only crashes using mp4 files.
Tested with a Nightly build 32bit version:
Name Firefox
Version 53.0a1
Build ID 20161201030205
Actual results:
(910.da0): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

Yes it also reproduces in safe mode, so far I only tested it on Windows with x86 and x86\_64 versions and they both reproduce. Haven't tested on Linux yet because my distro is lacking PulseAudio and doesn't open the mp4 file.

This is deeper than my usual playground, so no idea on the spot.
But keeping the NI:me to come back to it soon, unless Jean-Yves can work his magic beforehand.

It turns out that my assumption in [bug 1276529 comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1276529#c7 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Crash in mozilla::BaseMediaResource::ModifyLoadFlags") is right.
BaseMediaResource::ModifyLoadFlags calls nsLoadGroup::RemoveRequest which somehow spins the event loop and calls MediaResource::Destroy to delete the object. All access to BaseMediaResource members after nsLoadGroup::RemoveRequest() becomes use-after-free.
Not sure if this is a normal behavior about netwerk...

I did the test and the builds doesn't reproduce the crash with the testcase anymore, I guess it's fixed.

1329403\_fix.patch
I don't yet understand the crash.
Where are we crashing and why?
Is the issue that MediaDecoder calls FirstFrameLoaded without keeping mOwner alive, so not following the COM rules that caller should keep the callee alive?
And I guess similar applies to mDecoder->SetLoadInBackground(!aDelay); call.
Does something guarantee mDecoder stays alive long enough?
I think adding nsAutoScriptBlocker just hides to issues we have with lifetime management here. If you disagree, explain why and ask review again.
However, having nsAutoScriptBlocker here is perhaps good idea to ensure load event fires at the end of the method, not somewhere in middle.
So I could imagine a patch having nsAutoScriptBlocker and some RefPtrs to keep right objects alive. (The patch just with RefPtr should be enough to fix the crash)

Here is the stack from [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1329403#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - BaseMediaResource::ModifyLoadFlags Use-After-Free using MP4 video."):
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/225ab0637ed51b8b3f9f4ee2f9c339a37a65b626/dom/media/MediaResource.cpp#1561>
BaseMediaResource::ModifyLoadFlags calls nsLoadGroup::RemoveRequest which somehow causes 'onload' to fire to run the script in test.html (which calls document.write() to replace the content) to delete the media element which in turn deletes MediaDecoder as well as MediaResource.
So access to mChannel at #1567 is a UAF since the MediaResource object is already deleted.

Of course we can use death grips to keep the objects we care about alive durinig reentrant functions calls. However, I think reentrant functions calls are evil and result in unexpected/complicated call flow which I would like to prevent in the first place.

But is it guaranteed that nsAutoScriptBlocker fixes all the possible reentrancy issues?
Following the normal rules that caller keeps the callee alive feels like safer option to me.
And, I don't see anything keeping the element itself alive, so after FirstFrameLoaded() has called ChangeDelayLoadStatus(false), 'this' can be deleted object. (nsAutoScriptBlocker in ChangeDelayLoadStatus doesn't help with that, since scripts can run when the blocker goes out of scope)
Note, we do already in other case explicitly keep the element alive

This is bad for I expected nsAutoScriptBlocker to delay the script such that it will run asynchronously in next cycle.
I think the path forward is to fix [bug 1329934](/show_bug.cgi?id=1329934 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Need to call nsDocument::EnsureOnloadBlocker in nsDocument::SetScriptGlobalObject when mScriptGlobalObject changes from null to non-null") so |mLoadBlockedDoc->UnblockOnload(false)| [1] can work as expected to fire 'onlonad' asynchronously.

It is the responsibility of the caller to keep callee alive until the function returns (let alone death grip doesn't work for non-ref-counting types). However, reentrancy breaks this assumption which is what I want to prevent in the first place.

No, reentrancy doesn't break that. It is still up to the caller to keep callee alive. That is how we deal with this kinds of issues elsewhere in Gecko.

Well, I will avoid reentrancy whenever possible. It also avoid subtle bugs where the object lifetime must be carefully audited. I will submit for review soon.

|mLoadBlockedDoc->UnblockOnload(false)| can now work correctly to fire 'onload' asynchronously to avoid subtle bugs caused by reentrancy. (If 'onload' is fired synchronously, the script might call into media element functions recursively.)

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
[Bug 608634](/show_bug.cgi?id=608634 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intermittent test_error_in_video_document.html | Network state - got 2, expected 0 | Error object - didn't expect null, but got it") landed in 51; marking 50 and ESR45 as ? since the bug that fixed went back much further.
Marking for 51 tracking though time is short. JW (or smaug), please nominate for anything appropriate ASAP and for S-A, especially if you think it should be in 51 (RC1 is the next build). Otherwise, we may need to wait to later in the cycle to land this.

1329403\_fix\_v3.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Very unlikely. The patch is all about the delaying-the-load-event flag of media elements (<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#loading-the-media-resource:delaying-the-load-event-flag>).
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Not sure. But it should be as early as the beginning of [bug 608634](/show_bug.cgi?id=608634 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intermittent test_error_in_video_document.html | Network state - got 2, expected 0 | Error object - didn't expect null, but got it").
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Not sure. It might already be there since the feature is introduced by [bug 293818](/show_bug.cgi?id=293818 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIXr]Need document API for deferring onload").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Since [bug 293818](/show_bug.cgi?id=293818 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIXr]Need document API for deferring onload") is too old, I will only uplift the fix to esr45 and later version.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
The risk should be low for the change is quite simple. However, I would like a DOM peer to evaluate the risk. Treeherder should be enough for tests.

We will likely do an RC2 build since there's still at least one open blocker for the release. So we could still take this fix for 51 if it has sec-approval.

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Jan de Mooij, Tom Schuster, and Oriol reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

                 CVE-2017-5396

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Memory safety errors, use-after-frees and other implementation
errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, information
disclosure or privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.7.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.7.0esr-1 of firefox-esr and version 51.0-1 of firefox.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1308688#c0)• 8 years ago |
|  | |

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1295324](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295324 "VERIFIED FIXED - WebExtensions can easily access the mozAddonManager API and use it to gain elevated privileges.") +++
As a follow-up to [bug 1295324](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295324 "VERIFIED FIXED - WebExtensions can easily access the mozAddonManager API and use it to gain elevated privileges."), we also need to prevent extensions from modifying requests to sites with elevated permissions, since they can gain the same elevated privileges by modifying CSP headers and then redirecting script requests to inject malicious content.

The first patch was originally proposed and r+'ed on [bug 1295324](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295324 "VERIFIED FIXED - WebExtensions can easily access the mozAddonManager API and use it to gain elevated privileges."), but eventually discarded in favor of a different approach.
Since it touches webidl it needs a dom peer, but I'll wait until we've got agreement on the second patch.
Test case also coming shortly in a separate patch so it can be embargoed.

We also need to check the origin of the request so that it isn't possible to modify (e.g.) script load requests from AMO.

We should probably just use the originPrincipal for these last two, and not worry about the triggeringPrincipal. The former matters much more, in this case.

Ben, you r+'ed this patch earlier for a different bug before we discarded it for a different approach. But just in time for Halloween, it is rising from the grave...

This can just be `return IsValidHost(host);`. No need for the if-statement and separate return statements.

webrequest.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Tests are in a separate patch. The changes in this patch point in the general direction of the vulnerability but one needs a deeper understanding of the vulnerability to construct an exploit. Moreover, anybody who understands the vulnerability and is paying attention has probably already seen [bug 1295324](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295324 "VERIFIED FIXED - WebExtensions can easily access the mozAddonManager API and use it to gain elevated privileges.") so they're unlikely to figure out much new from seeing this one.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Everything since mozAddonManager shipped in 48.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
1245571
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I haven't actually tried it but the changes should backport with little difficulty.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Tests are included. This could cause existing addons that use WebRequest.jsm to stop working when used on sites like AMO, but I don't think there's any way to avoid that (we had the same situation with [bug 1295324](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295324 "VERIFIED FIXED - WebExtensions can easily access the mozAddonManager API and use it to gain elevated privileges.") which lead to [bug 1310082](/show_bug.cgi?id=1310082 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - WebExtension content script not working on mozilla.org sites")...)

This is waaaaay too late for 50, which is on its final beta already.
This needs to go in two weeks after we ship, which is now Nov 15, making this a "sec-approval+ for checkin on 11/29" patch. Tests can't go in until after we ship the fix in a final release build so this approval is only for the non-tests patch.
Once it is on trunk, we'll want to backport it to Aurora and Beta.

webrequest.patch
Just a drive by comment.
- loadingPrincipal can be null, are we certain it is never null in this case?
- I've been looking at WebRequest.jsm as a base library with access to all, and cutting off access in ext-webrequest for things we don't want webextensions to see. That's just my approach, not sure it really matters.

I basically needed to rewrite the patch to accomodate all the changes since this was originally approved, I added a check that loadingPrincipal is not null.
On the second point, we don't pass enough information to the handlers to make the decision inside ext-webrequest.js. Instead of changing that interface, I took the simpler route, partly since this will become irrelevant soon enough when non-webextension addons disappear.

Expose mozAddonManager allowed hosts to chrome
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
mozAddonManager ([bug 1245571](/show_bug.cgi?id=1245571 "RESOLVED FIXED - Access to the add-ons installed"))
[User impact if declined]:
The patches here address a security vulnerability, without these patches, the vulnerability will be present.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Yes, though they are in a separate patch which will presumably remain embargoed for some time
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
other than automated testing, not yet
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
steps to reproduce are described at a high level in the original bug. Kris or I could probably produce a working extension to use for testing
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
just the other patch attached to this bug
[Is the change risky?]:
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
this patch is not at all risky it just adds a new function exposed to javascript. the second patch is riskier since it changes the behavior of the webextensions webRequest api but the changes are covered by unit tests.
[String changes made/needed]:
none

If it was just the second patch that failed to apply, the original patch should apply cleanly:
<https://bug1308688.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=8805669>
I'm sorry I have to step away for a moment and can't actually verify this myself right now, but I can do so later today if the above doesn't work or the sheriffs don't have the time or interest in trying that patch.Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

Ritu, this and [bug 1320057](/show_bug.cgi?id=1320057 "VERIFIED FIXED - Remote code execution vulnerability in Pocket extension") should go into 50.1, unless we're ok with doing a gofaster push, but that seems like a pain when a release is 2 weeks away.

So the original patch was too aggressive in blocking header modifications for loads without a loading principal. This was responsible for the mochitest failures on beta, and a user separately reported that this broke top level loads with user agent switcher. But this suggests that we lost some test coverage with [bug 1314492](/show_bug.cgi?id=1314492 "RESOLVED FIXED - deconstructing WebRequest test deconstructivism"). Shane, can you look into that?
Anyhow, I've updated new beta patches and will add a follow-up for central and aurora momentarily.
As for whether we want uplift to release, I think that's up to security, clearing my needinfo for that.

Andrew, loads without a loadingPrincipal are top level loads, so yeah, they shouldn't be blocked. I missed that aspect of the patch in my driveby. [Bug 1273138](/show_bug.cgi?id=1273138 "RESOLVED FIXED - WebExtensions: webRequest listeners do not fire for XMLHttpRequest requests generated by the extension") broke top level loads, [bug 1318800](/show_bug.cgi?id=1318800 "RESOLVED FIXED - webrequest regression listening on top level loads in browser tabs") (pending uplift to aurora) fixed that as well as fixing tests for that situation. I think landing this bug may have beat [bug 1318800](/show_bug.cgi?id=1318800 "RESOLVED FIXED - webrequest regression listening on top level loads in browser tabs"), thus the tests didn't catch it.

But from a quick glance, it looks like [bug 1318800](/show_bug.cgi?id=1318800 "RESOLVED FIXED - webrequest regression listening on top level loads in browser tabs") covers passive listeners, but not blocking listeners that make changes to headers. We had coverage of that prior to [bug 1314492](/show_bug.cgi?id=1314492 "RESOLVED FIXED - deconstructing WebRequest test deconstructivism") but we apparently don't have it now. That's what Kris is asking for in [comment 41](/show_bug.cgi?id=1308688#c41 "RESOLVED FIXED - Prevent WebExtensions from modifying requests to hosts with mozAddonManager permissions").Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

What is the argument for needing this in 50.1 versus taking it in 51 (which is the default). I'm loathe to take non-desperate changes in 50.1 due to the fact that there are zero betas for 50.1.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

Nothing specific other than the fact it was classified sec-high. Sounds like leaving it as is (fixed in 51 and newer but nothing else) would be reasonable.Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

We obviously have to land any fixups for existing tests (I don't think I saw any on this one).
We don't /have/ to uplift the unit tests for this fix, but then we will need to manually verify the fix on those branches. Sometimes uplifted fixes don't work because they built (unawares) on some more recent behavior that's not in the branches.

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

## Topic

An update for firefox is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a
detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

[Updated 21 February 2017]
This advisory has been updated to include Firefox packages for the PPC and S390
architectures that were previously omitted. For this revised update, packages
for all architectures were rebuilt. The rebuilt packages do not contain any new
code changes.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

This update upgrades Firefox to version 45.7.0 ESR.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web

page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2017-5373, CVE-2017-5375, CVE-2017-5376, CVE-2017-5378, CVE-2017-5380,
