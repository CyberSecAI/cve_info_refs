Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Media Decoder within Mozilla products. This occurs when certain events are triggered after the memory used by media elements has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. The media decoder attempts to access memory that has been deallocated. This can happen due to how media elements are managed, particularly when events fire after those elements are no longer valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to memory corruption.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With enough effort, the memory corruption could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
- **Crash:** The vulnerability could lead to a crash of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Media Files:** A malicious actor could craft a specially designed media file (such as an MP4) that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Web Content:** This could be exploited through a malicious website that serves up the specially crafted media file, and interacts with it in ways that trigger the vulnerability.
- **Email/Browser-like contexts**: As noted in the Thunderbird advisory, this vulnerability is a potential risk in "browser or browser-like contexts", since "scripting is disabled when reading mail". However, it could be exploitable in a browser window opened by Thunderbird.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote/Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted media file to the vulnerable application. This could be done remotely via a website or through a link in an email.
- **User Interaction:** Usually, a user needs to interact with the malicious media content (e.g., by opening an email with a malicious link).

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located within `BaseMediaResource::ModifyLoadFlags`.
- The `MediaResource::Destroy` method is invoked in such a way that it causes a use-after-free in `BaseMediaResource::ModifyLoadFlags`, because the object was already deallocated before accessing members such as mChannel
- The vulnerability involves interaction between `nsLoadGroup::RemoveRequest` and `MediaResource::Destroy`, where the destruction process occurs before the access to the resource in  `ModifyLoadFlags`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by how some events related to the media resource are fired after the media resources are released.
*   This vulnerability was present in Firefox 50.1, Firefox ESR 45.6, and Thunderbird 45.6. It was fixed in Firefox 51 and Thunderbird 45.7.
*   The fix involved adding checks to ensure the media element exists and is valid when certain events are fired.
*   There is also a fix that was introduced in this release to properly unblock onload events to avoid issues caused by reentrancy.

**Summary of Patches/Fixes:**

-   Patches were developed to prevent access of members after a resource is freed.
-   Some patches used a `nsAutoScriptBlocker` to address reentrancy issues, and prevent `onload` from firing prematurely.
- The final fix added checks before accessing members of the resource to avoid UAF.

**Impact:**
This is classified as a high severity vulnerability, as it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine if exploited successfully, though a crash is more likely.
