{
  "CVE-2017-5444": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the parsing of `application/http-index-format` content when the header contains improperly formatted data, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A potentially exploitable crash and the ability to read data from memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious `application/http-index-format` content with an improperly formatted header.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control the HTTP response containing the malicious `application/http-index-format` content.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is located in `nsDirIndexParser::ParseData`. The issue arises because the code does not properly validate the number of tokens in the data line and increments the `aDataStr` pointer without checking for the null terminator, which can lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer. Additionally, uninitialized memory can be read into the array because the code does not initialize the array elements when parsing content using `application/http-index-format`."
