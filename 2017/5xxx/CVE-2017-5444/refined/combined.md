Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous, David Baron, Mats Palmgren, Ronald Crane, Bob Clary, and Chris Peterson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Networking
▾

Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

Cause of bug
-------------
Bug is in nsDirIndexParser::ParseData method of netwerk\streamconv\converters\nsDirIndexParser.cpp file.
This is the http-index-format content which causes this bug.
200:a a a\r\n"
201:a\r\n"
Header line has 3 tokens. But data line has only 1 token.
This method should validate number of tokens in data line.
This method also has 3 places where it advances char\* aDataStr pointer without checking whether pointer has reached null terminator.
Ex: \*aDataStr++ = '\0';

This bug can be used to read some data from memory and display on a web page.
Is it OK if I attach a proof of concept test case here?

Attached patch

[0001-bug-1344461-keep-track-of-line-length-to-not-read-be.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8846576&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8846576&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1344461&attachment=8846576)

This bug exists already in the code imported from CVS to hg back in 2007. It seems to originate from [Bug 78148](/show_bug.cgi?id=78148 "RESOLVED FIXED - clean up directory listing stream converters") (commit 584595884a1521 on gecko-dev@github)
My proposed patch here is to simply also pass in the line length as an argument and keep track of how much there's left when the pointer is advanced, so that the code won't read or write outside of the given constraints. Instead it will return an error from the parser function, something that wasn't done before! With my patch applied, the already attached httpindex.php test case scenario (and variations of it) seems to no longer cause any problems.
I found no existing tests using the format as input.
This patch is intended to also fix [Bug 1344467](/show_bug.cgi?id=1344467 "RESOLVED FIXED - Uninitialized value in nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat") which is closely related.
Jason, any suggestion on a reviewer for this?

v2-0001-bug-1344461-keep-track-of-line-length-to-not-read.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Fairly easy.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The current commit message might be a bit too direct since it even speaks of "beyond eol". The commit itself does introduce a buffer range control and isn't very complicated so that fact is easily spotted.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Everything since October 2001(!)
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This code area is very old and hasn't changed much in recent time so backports should be straight-forward.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
I'd say it is low risk (based on the relative simplicity of the patch) and it is a fairly unused feature.

Argh. It seems so completely random to me and no, I don't have any explanation for this atm. I don't see why this change would behave differently there or why that test would be affected in the first place! I need to dig deeper.

"test timed out" even, which seems even more suspicious methinks. Can we/I rerun this test a few more times to see if it this happens all the time? macos 10.6 is a bit tricky to test locally! =(

This failing test was removed in [bug 1261019](/show_bug.cgi?id=1261019 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove the Apps API") and might take some effort to work out since it only happens on macos 10.6.
Can we maybe consider disabling that specific test in esr45 ? I find it unlikely that this is actually a bug in the code since it (seemingly) works on all other platforms and branches.

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Networking
▾

Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

Cause of Bug
------------
Bug is present in below mentioned lines of ProcessNextState method in netwerk\streamconv\converters\nsBinHexDecoder.cpp file.
mName.BeginWriting()[mCount] = c;
if (++mCount > mName.Length())
{
...
DetectContentType(aRequest, mName);
Above if condition should also check whether "++mCount" is equal to mName.Length(). Otherwise "mName.BeginWriting()[mCount] = c;" will write a character to string terminating null value.

Attached patch

[0001-bug-1342661-out-of-bounds-check-before-assigning-r.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8843938&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8843938&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1342661&attachment=8843938)

[This problem seems to have existed since at least this commit: <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/194b881050ac> (August 2009) - which modified the range check from the previous version, but it may have existed before that. I didn't research the previous logic.]
The question I've not really worked out for myself is weather we should error out completely on this condition or if we only should ignore the specific bad write. The patch I'm attaching here does the latter since it is the least invasive change that should still avoid the bad assign.
If I got this right, the trailing-zero overwrite is more or less done on purpose since the binhex format is supposed to end the file name with a zero byte so the original code from before 2009 that didn't use a nsCString string had to zero terminate the string. The mistake was to assume that there would always be a zero byte in the source.
Thoughts?

Sure I can put up a dumb fuzzer tonight targeting "application/mac-binhex40". Should I add any other content types to the list? Keep in mind this will be very dumb for the time being.Flags: needinfo?(twsmith)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The patch looks good. Thanks for fixing this.
It's funny that this code was dependent on a non-zero uninitialized value for so long. But then again mac-binhex40 probably isn't that common.

v2-0001-bug-1342661-boundary-check-before-assigning-r-val.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
It easy to figure out how to do an out of bounds write, making an exploit out if it is slightly trickier but probably not terribly complicated.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
It is \*only\* an added boundary check so even with no added comments it may trigger some people's interest.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All. The bug has been around since a long time, but happens easier since [bug 1276625](/show_bug.cgi?id=1276625 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Static Analysis][Uninitialized pointer field] In constructor nsBinHexDecoder") was fixed in version 49.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The same patch is likely to work on all branches.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
I estimate a very low risk. It is only a single added boundary check.

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer
overflows and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, information disclosure or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.9.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.9.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.
