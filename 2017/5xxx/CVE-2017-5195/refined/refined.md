Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-5195:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in Irssi's ANSI x8 color code parsing logic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The code parsing ANSI x8 color codes within Irssi does not properly check if the end of the input string has been reached, leading to the possibility of reading beyond the allocated memory.
*   **Improper input validation:** The code fails to validate if the input string is still within the bounds during the parsing of ANSI x8 color codes.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause Irssi to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** A remote attacker could send specially crafted IRC messages containing incomplete ANSI x8 color codes to trigger the vulnerability in the irssi client

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Control over IRC server/message content:** An attacker would need to be able to send messages to the victim's irssi client that contain the specific malformed ANSI color codes. This could be achieved through control of an IRC server or by sending specially crafted messages to the victim via a compromised client or server.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Irssi versions 0.8.17 and later.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Irssi version 0.8.21 and 1.0.0.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read).
