{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A mechanism to bypass file system access protections in the sandbox was present in the `PFileSystemRequestConstructor` through an IPC message. This allowed for local file system read and write access by a compromised content process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Sandbox escape",
    "Improper Input Validation",
    "Incorrect privilege assignment",
    "Missing access controls"
    
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary local file system read and write access, leading to potential privilege escalation from a compromised content process.",
  "Attack vectors": "A compromised content process could send a malicious `PFileSystemRequest` message to the parent process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to compromise a content process within the browser to send a malicious IPC message to the parent."
