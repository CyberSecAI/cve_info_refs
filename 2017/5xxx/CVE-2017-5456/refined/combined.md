Attached file
[Script PoC](attachment.cgi?id=8839322)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8839322&action=edit)

Feed reader appears to have an inappropriate security model. From testing, it seems to allow the child process to change arbitrary preferences, which pretty much game over for sandboxing on its own, but it also allows for execution of arbitrary commands via nsIShellService.
When I first looked at this, I actually thought that feed-reader was safe, due to it only listening for one message on the parentprocessmessagemanager. (FeedConverter:ExecuteClientApp) I prevoiusly thought calling window.messageManager.addMessageListener() in the parent, wouldn't expose a messageHandler to the child. (and thus I thought the handlers at [1] were not exposed to the child)
However I've been doing some testing in the Browser Content Toolbox, and it seems possible to send messages to fire these messages. Definitely need to get some confirmation here.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start a browser running e10s enabled
2. open any remote page (about:home) and the Browser Content Toolbox
3. Paste the script from the attachment to launch Calculator.app (mac only)
If this test approach is valid (ie its not some devtools weirdness im overlooking) then we need to change the way the feedwriter is remoted. At a minimum we need to whitelist the pref names that can be changed, but also ensure that the file path can ONLY come from the file picker in the parent process.

Reason #6512352345234 to kill our feed reader.
More seriously, I don't think you're wrong generally. Switching the feed reader to using AsyncPrefs (which has a builtin list of allowed prefs) might be possible (though I'm not sure if the subset of prefs the feedreader needs is well-contained, and it looks like we'd need to add complex pref support to asyncprefs).

How would you even do this, though? The code that sends a message to the parent (never mind the code that receives it) is umpteen degrees of separation/abstraction away from the filepicker code. :-(Component: General → RSS Discovery and Preview

So, tbh, I think this means we should remove the ability to change feed reader handler apps from the feed preview page, and replace it with a link that opens about:preferences#applications in a separate tab.

If its too hard to keep the data in the parent, then we could just implement the pref whitelist (similar to [1] perhaps), and then add some message validation (maybe cache the file name in the parent side of the messender, and validate that its the same when we get it back from the child).
JKT any chance you could look at this?

That also works for me, and maybe makes more sense. Definitely less attack surface this way and then we can remove the messages altogether which is a win.

Oh, hm, I assumed it was just using an <input type=file> for this, but it looks like it all goes via explicit messages, so you're right that we could cache things in <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/106a96755d3bcebe64bbbc3b521d65d262ba9c02/browser/base/content/browser-feeds.js#198> somehow.

We could even just send a name and/or icon and identifier down to the child, not giving the child access to the full path of the app at all. That also avoids passing up full paths (back) into the parent (that it then has to use/trust). If asked to open anything with an identifier it doesn't know, it can't do anything. :-)

Attached patch

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1341191&attachment=8842151)

I thought I would upload a WIP patch of the direction I was going in.
- I fixed the Mime parser being in content which actually fixes a separate bug and stops it complaining in console.
- I moved pref setting decisions to browser-feeds.js
- Cleaned up code that was using the same vars
- Prevented a race condition of missing \_document in receiveMessage
- Created setApplicationLauncherMenuItem to make a clearer messaging interface to the client
- Created a unified SetFeedPref method for all pref setting
- Created GetReaderForType and GetAlwaysUseState so the child doesn't have to even look at prefs (still some code to remove for this also)
TODO:
- Move the web content handler code into parent process, so get handlers is a new message the client can call to enumerate the select box but nothing else
- Ensure client calls the parent before using a web handler
- Establish if the second call to this.\_chooseClientApp in subscribe is ever called
- Check there isn't anything else alsoFlags: needinfo?(ptheriault)Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

The STR to add a new web feed reader is using Same Origin of the example here: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerContentHandler>
So go to example.com and paste that into console, which will open up a permission prompt. We should probably make these content handlers HTTPS only too as it's a super powerful feature to consume all of a mime type.

I applied and tested with this patch. I observed a couple problems:
1. after you select a new external app, it isn't selected as the chosen app in the select box (minor but confusing)
2. after you select a new external app the subscribe button is broken (nothing happens when I click subscribe)
I think I found the issue (or one of them). See below.

There is a bug at this line: response contains UI elements and other things that can't be serialised. Debugging I see the following when breaking after this line:
>>>console.log(response)
Object { handlers: Array[1], showFirstRunUI: false, defaultMenuItem: XPCWrappedNative\_NoHelper, selectedMenuItem: XPCWrappedNative\_NoHelper }
They need to be something which can be sent (ie a string or whatever you are expecting in the child)

It looks like this is still in a lot of flux and Paul has already looked at this, so not going to deep-dive, but one thing I noticed when looking over a previous version of the patch is that it created some member variables where we previously used local variables (for the handlers list), but didn't null those out in the code nulling out the document/\_window references. Any additional permanent dom references should probably be nulled out, too, to avoid leaks.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

[Bug 1341191 - fix messaging priv escalation of feed reader, simplify messaging from parent to child. Reduce race conditions on page.](attachment.cgi?id=8843593&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1341191&attachment=8843593)

- I checked over that we no longer needed the selected code from choose client app as we use pref observing to handle this.
- This also removed the outstanding issue: "filename didn't get picked up when selecting from file picker. Selecting again then worked."
- GetReaderForType was then able to be removed too.
- I checked that wccr.getWebContentHandlerByURI won't allow a user to push in anything into the message and get escalation there too.
- I removed the PREF\_\*SELECTED\_APP observing as SetApplicationLauncherMenuItem handles this change, the user likely just searched for a new app and we are updating the interface there.
- I checked over our browser/components/feeds/ and toolkit/components/feeds/ tests and all passed.
Sone of this is my fav way of doing this however I wanted to go for the minimal transitions of this code possible. This is however ready for review and I can file follow up bugs on work that really should be done also.

Just tested all the things I could think of an it seems to work for me (it even worked with yahoo though this first time flow is spectacularly bad). In terms of solving the security bug, your changes have removed the vulnerable messages and the IPC that remains looks safe to me. I'm not thrilled that we still have "FeedConverter:ExecuteClientApp" (since it means that ability to write this pref means trivial code exec) but so long as we have the preview page I guess we can't avoid that.Flags: needinfo?(ptheriault)

:gijs comments addressed
Regarding the observers on the content side and the messaging, I wanted to simplify the content side so it was more obvious if it was doing anything bad. I also hope in follow up bugs we can clean up the use of the observers as I'm pretty sure we can make about:preferences use this object also which means we won't need to observe at all just make a one way message in response to all the open pages when the prefs are set.

bug-1341191-7.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
A sandbox escape would have to happen to exploit the code however they have full ability to execute anything on the machine based on the STR.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not explicitly, the code has been changed to be very explicit about preferences being set and executed and moved into the parent process. The code was manually tested so to work to the same functionality.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Exploit started in Firefox 47 with [Bug 1109714](/show_bug.cgi?id=1109714 "VERIFIED FIXED - Handle anonymous XUL feed subscriber UI in e10s")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
None, I suspect it would be easier to disable the feature for older branches if we have a known sandbox escape.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Currently we have very few tests for the UX of feed preview selection and in its current state it seems very broken. I suspect we should file follow up testing and UX fixes. This patch fixes a bunch of issues with subscribing and autoloading the reader, ultimately how it is in stable seems broken to me and mostly unusable. So I would suggest the risk of further breakage is low.
Specifically the always use flow and web reader flow didn't work for me at all (See comments in the bug).

bug-1341191-7.patch
I don't think this is working quite right. There's a few things:
1) on current nightly, the "always use <whatever> to subscribe to feeds" is disabled by default. After your patch, it's checked by default
2) if I follow the following steps:
a) open Firefox with your patch on a clean profile
b) open <http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml>
c) in the dropdown, select "my yahoo!", and click 'subscribe'
d) click back. Now you're looking at the feed again (which is a little surprising, because we said we always wanted to subscribe using 'my yahoo'
e) in the dropdown, select 'choose application' and pick an app of your choice (I picked google chrome, just because I could)
f) untick the checkbox
g) click 'subscribe now'
h) close the extra app (chrome or whatever)
i) on the feed page which is still open in Firefox, click any of the article links, then click 'back'
expected: you see the feed page.
actual: chrome launches and you don't see the feed page
Keeping the review flag because I'm still looking at this...

[Comment 33](/show_bug.cgi?id=1341191#c33 "VERIFIED FIXED - Feed Reader IPC can be used to bypass process sandboxing"):
STR:
1. Go to the feed preview of <https://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510289>
2. Select My Yahoo and Always use and click subscribe now
3. Return to <https://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510289> and notice it isn't checked
Manually setting a default in the prefs or using about:preferences#applications causes the page to do a blank white page.
To set the default action manually:
1. about:preferences#applications
2. Search Web Feed
3. Change the dropdown to something else
This patch actually makes that more common as I fixed the always-use checkbox storage which was why it wasn't happening as much before. I'm still trying to dig into why this happens however it isn't clear. It appears browser/components/feeds/FeedConverter.js wccr.getAutoHandler(TYPE\_MAYBE\_FEED) is the issue with the call not being received by WebContentConverter.js. All I can assume is the request is of the wrong type and being prevented by the IDL there perhaps.Flags: needinfo?(jkt)

I deleted the code in FeedConverter.js that checked for getAutoHandler and redirected as since this was moved to e10s the code no longer worked as WebContentConverter.js returned a different API at the bottom of it's file based on if it is running in content. Moving this to use the messaging to the feed preview on init solves process issue and also TYPE\_IMAGE (This is actually a common feed type) which wasn't being caught pre e10s move also.
wccr.getAutoHandler() isn't checked more than once though which means if the autohandler is set to "My Yahoo" at browser startup it will always redirect to "My Yahoo" until the pref is changed and the browser is restarted.
:Gijs The only difference between patch-8 and patch-9 is fixing [Comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=1341191#c35 "VERIFIED FIXED - Feed Reader IPC can be used to bypass process sandboxing").

Can we have a followup for this, though, as it now seems that the feed preview page loads (visibly!) before we load the yahoo or whatever other web handler is registered? It should be able to redirect immediately...

Ah, that's kind of unfortunate... is this also a regression? I don't really understand why/how this works the way it does. The code looks to me like it's checking the prefs every time the subscription UI loads. So why doesn't this work?
In fact, with the latest patch, even after a pref change in the application panel in the options, \*and\* a browser restart, I \*still\* get redirected to yahoo. That doesn't seem OK to land. :-(

We could follow up with this however it seems now that I have fixed the storage of the alwaysUse the case where the user would get a white screen when viewing a feed would be much more common. I could perhaps break the checkbox again and file that in a follow up also.
The flicker of the preview was "expected" because I made the content page handle the redirection. I would have to fix the code a lot more to get it working in the Converter code rather than the preview page.

getAutoHandler reads from a cache in \_setAutoHandler which doesn't seem to be updated when the pref updates, it also as you mention appears to not update on pref update (my experience was the browser would close before storing the pref even if setting it in about:config).
So in summary I think patch 8 would better with a broken always use again. The follow up bug can fix the remaining issue(s).

bug-1341191-8-b.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
A sandbox escape would have to happen to exploit the code however they have full ability to execute anything on the machine based on the STR.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not explicitly, the code has been changed to be very explicit about preferences being set and executed and moved into the parent process. The code was manually tested so to work to the same functionality.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Exploit started in Firefox 47 with [Bug 1109714](/show_bug.cgi?id=1109714 "VERIFIED FIXED - Handle anonymous XUL feed subscriber UI in e10s")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
None, I suspect it would be easier to disable the feature for older branches if we have a known sandbox escape.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Currently we have very few tests for the UX of feed preview selection and in its current state it seems very broken. I suspect we should file follow up testing and UX fixes. This patch fixes a bunch of issues with subscribing and autoloading the reader, ultimately how it is in stable seems broken to me and mostly unusable. So I would suggest the risk of further breakage is low.
Specifically the always use flow and web reader flow didn't work for me at all (See comments in the bug).

I'll go give approvals on them. Normally, you can just nominate the patch for the branch it is for an either someone in security or in release managers will come along and approve it afterwards.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

A new eslint rule ([bug 1345294](/show_bug.cgi?id=1345294 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsIPrefBranch should have methods to get/set unicode strings")) was enabled in the time since this patch was written, so eslint was failing like <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/logviewer.html#?job_id=85121832&repo=mozilla-inbound>
I landed a followup in <https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/58671e4ff465454f4998d3648cd04b7b1d7ede3e> that will hopefully handle it correctly.
The rule is only enabled in 55+, so it shouldn't be needed on any of the uplifts.Flags: needinfo?(jkt)

This STR in comment one is really more of a proof of concept than a security bug. Its not something which you can verify through testing (other than observing that the PoC doesn't work any more).
But I can confirm that its verified as fixed through code review. You can look here: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-beta/source/browser/base/content/browser-feeds.js#586>
That's the altered version of what was vulnerable before - instead of taking the preference name and value from the child, the preference name is chosen from a whitelist in the parent if I am reading this correctly. I test this before the patch landed, and you can see also that the previously vulnerable message listener ("FeedWriter:SetFeedCharPref") has been removed from the codebase.
I also verified this in 53 beta, just now. If you want to replicate, the steps are:
1. (optional maybe?) enable e10s (set browser.tabs.remote.force-enable to true)
2. open any remote page (about:home) and the Browser Toolbox (NOTE: NOT the Browser Content Toolbox, we want to look at the parent process)
3. Open the debugger tab in the Toolbox, and search for browser-feeds.js
There you can confirm by visual inspection that the vulnerable message FeedWriter:SetFeedCharPref doesnt exist in this file.
But I've just done that, so I guess I'll set this to verified and you can change it if this isn't appropriate.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIEDFlags: needinfo?(ptheriault)

BTW in case this isn't clear, this is a sandbox escape bug - it doesn't apply to non-e10s builds because they don't have content processes to sandbox, so there is nothing to escape from.

browser-feeds.js is loaded using a <script> tag, so it shares the global scope of browser.xul... and this patch is adding plenty of symbols exposed in the global scope :-(. Especially things with names as generic as "LOG"; I hope nothing else has started to unintentionally rely on this file.

Good point, let me raise a follow up. Probably not a hard patch to clear up all of these globals.
From what I can see it is only there. As you mention though that is a wide scope though, sorry about this.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Milan Sreckovic, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Philipp, Tooru Fujisawa, and Kan-Ru Chen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52 and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |

Attached patch

[DO NOT COMMIT - PoC code for demonstrating priv esc](attachment.cgi?id=8843522&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8843522&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1344415&attachment=8843522)

Since we are in the process of rolling out a sandbox for each platform, it is not only important to make it as tight as possible but also make sure that we don't have any unintended behavior that would allow to bypass the sandbox restrictions.
IPC is probably going to be the first point of attack when trying to escalate from a compromised content process.
Vulnerable Part
====================
I took a look at one particular IPC message from the PBackground protocol, called PFileSystemRequest [1] due to its name.
The argument for that message is defined as follows:
> union FileSystemParams
> {
> FileSystemCreateDirectoryParams;
> FileSystemCreateFileParams;
> FileSystemGetDirectoryListingParams;
> FileSystemGetFilesParams;
> FileSystemGetFileOrDirectoryParams;
> FileSystemRemoveParams;
> };
Now looking at that protocol in more detail, it is basically possible to bypass all of our file system restrictions implemented in our sandbox (no matter the platform), currently write access to the file system is restricted on the latest Linux nightly build. However, given a compromised content process, this restriction can be bypassed using the above mentioned message.
I looked at one request in particular namely FileSystemCreateFileParams.
Now there are some security checks performed on the parent side, but only for devicestorage access.
However, the critical part here is that no security checks whatsoever are performed for native file system access.
I.e. if the compromised child supplies a path like "/home/<user>/.bashrc" as part of FileSystemCreateFileParam, it can write whatever it likes into that file, since the file content to be written is supplied with that message as well.
The API is powerful enough to even allow overwriting existing files...
This functions [2] checks the path coming from the child, if it doesn't start with "devicestorage-" a OSFileSystemParent object is created and returned, and as part of the constructor, a member variable is set which gives unrestricted access [3].
Furthermore, a last check before any operation is performed on the file path coming from the child here [4] leads to a simple 'return true' here [5]. Thus allowing any file to be overwritten/created as long as the user that is running Firefox has access.
This in itself is already a problem and ideally this message should be removed entirely, or at least get a whitelist restriction on the parent side.
Privilege Escalation
====================
Since I wanted to see if it is possible to gain code execution, I decided to get a PoC that would allow me to run arbitrary code with the parent privileges. Attached is a patch that allows to trigger the PoC, following some simple steps.
1. Compile Firefox with the patch applied
2. Run firefox and open some website (e.g. google.com)
3. Open the web console (Tools -> Web Developer -> Web Console)
4. Run inside the web console: window.Directory.triggerIPC("<path to file you want to create/overwrite>");
When calling triggerIPC(), the PFileSystemRequest message will be sent accross the channel to the parent, the targeted file is specified as the first argument. The content of the file is an ELF shared library that declares a constructor:
> #include <stdlib.h>
>
> \_\_attribute\_\_((constructor)) static void constr(void)
> {
> unsetenv("LD\_PRELOAD");
> unsetenv("LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH");
> system("id");
> }
I decided to overwrite one of the libraries that are shipped with Firefox (libxul.so) because the parent process is probably allowed to write in that directory where those files reside and given a compromised content process, figuring out where the Firefox root directory is located is a trivial task. So as a path I supplied:
> "/home/tedd/projects/build-dev/toolkit/library/libxul.so"
This overwrites the existing libxul.so and the next time Firefox is started, it will load that library, and as part of the initialization, the libraries constructor function is executed.
For test purpose, I execute 'id'. Firefox will not be able to start, but you will see the output of 'id' on your terminal.
I decided to go with a Firefox library because it is probably the most reliable way, but there may be other more clever ways to do it.

Looks like some sort of B2G api that's still around. According to the docs it's supposed to be virtualized and you're not supposed to be able to create files.
"The API doesn't give you access to the local file system, nor is the sandbox really a section of the file system. Instead, it is a virtualized file system that looks like a full-fledged file system to the web app. It does not necessarily have a relationship to the local file system outside the browser."

Jim, you are right. This is a B2G API. It was still in use for Connected-Devices, but I guess now we can remove it.
We keep the read-only part of it, because it's used by Entries API and Directory Upload API.Blocks: [1299500](/show_bug.cgi?id=1299500 "RESOLVED FIXED - Get rid of DeviceStorage API")Flags: needinfo?(amarchesini)

:baku, keeping the read-only part should then be re-written somehow, because the next step for sandboxing (at least on Linux) is to lock down read access and this would allow to bypass the sandbox.

Just found 'device.storage.enabled' which is false for the desktop browser. Which may mean this api is disabled by default. Need to confirm this however through some testing.

hey :jimm, 'device.storage.enabled' does not fix this, the only it does (when set to true) expose more to JavaScript, see [1]. So with device storage enabled you could probably access this with legitimate JS code, if you could still create/write arbitrary files, I don't know, I haven't paid attention to that when auditing the code, but I saw that there was some checking done and the child code didn't seem to allow full OS paths.
However, the problem here is that the underlying IPC/IPDL protocol is compiled into the code and since PFileSystemRequest is part of PBackground a compromised child still has access to it.

I don't see a patch, how much work/risk would it be to fix? I'd hate to make all the other good security fixes in 52 wait (especially an ASLR bypass fix). Since this is an API it's hard to imagine it's going to be a one-liner or other small fix, unless the fix is just removing the problem code because we don't need it.
Sounds like a better idea for a point release. We're only 9 or 10 days from the pwn2own conference though so no guarantee a point release is going to make it on to their contest VMs (in fact I'm only "reasonably" confident 52 itself will).

Minimally-invasive patch that makes the parent drop requests for file/dir creation and removals, but doesn't remove all the supporting code. This prevented a Mac version of the PoC code from working for me, but I don't have a good of sense of whether or these API's are needed right now. The idea being use this as a quick fix and follow up with a complete fix removing all supporting code. Comments?

kill.patch
Just confirmed, this patch does not fix the issue.
So you CheckPermission runnable is instantiated and dispatched here [1].
However the actual code path taken is that if-statement in that same function body here [2].
So the 'exploit' is taking a different path.

The code path is as follows:
1. AllocPFileSystemRequestParent() [1] is called when PFileSysteRequestConstructor message is sent (note this is called before RecvPFileSystemRequestConstructor() is called.
2. A new FileSystemRequestParent object is created and Initialize() [1] is called.
3. Initialize() dispatches based on the type [2]
4. mFileSystem is initialized with the return value of DeserializeDOMPath() [3]
Now here comes the important part, unless the path starts with "devicestorage-" (which it doesn't, let's assume it is "/home/tedd/somefile") a new OSFileSystemParent object is created [3].
5. The constructor sets the variable mPermissionCheckType to ePermissionCheckNotRequired[4]
This leads to the path taken that I mentioned in [Comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=1344415#c16 "RESOLVED FIXED - Privilege escalation/Sandbox escape using PFileSystemRequestConstructor") because this check:
> if (actor->PermissionCheckType() == FileSystemBase::ePermissionCheckNotRequired) {
is true.

If we are talking about FileSystem IPC calls or read/write operations on OS files, this bug is already fixed because DeviceStorage API is gone and now, with the Entries API, we allow just the reading of files.
This means that, content process can have access to any file on the OS but in readonly. This readonly access is granted because <input type="file"> happens on the child process.
If we want to improve the Sandbox security, we could combine FilePicker and following File APIs: What about if we introduce a parent-only call to assign local paths to a tab context, so that, when the FilePicker is opened and a dir/file is chosen, we store with the local path and the tab context. Any following file-related IPC calls, will check if the tab context has access to that local path.Flags: needinfo?(ehsan)

Yes, I was talking about a branch fix. Sorry if I wasn't clear. I was assuming you weren't even going to land this on m-c as I reviewed those patches as well.

That sounds like a great idea to me. (We should only grant access to the specific file chosen unless if the directory picker was used, not the entire directory.)Flags: needinfo?(ehsan)

The backport of this patch should be handled with care. For one thing, the patch basically describes the security issue. The code changes also make it moderately risky... I can't think of a better way to do this unfortunately.

Well, maybe the contentProcess was not sharing any file. Get() would return null.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easy at all. the child process must be completely hacked and a custom IPC message must be sent from child to parent in order to retrieve a File object.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The patch is about introducing a security model for sharing granted files cross processes. It's generic enough.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
We should backport it, but I want to wait a couple of days before asking this: I want to see if there are regressions in nightly: if the file is not allowed, the child process is killed.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Entries API + DeviceStorage API.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
I think I covered (and tested) all the entry-points for the fileSystem APIs. If I forgot something, the child process crashes and we can quickly fix.

I don't understand exactly how nsContentUtils::TransferableToIPCTransferable is used, but it looks like the data is coming from a drag event or file dialog which comes from the parent so it's safe to grant access to this file or directory. Is that right?

We should make sure aDirectoryPath doesn't include symlinks. If it ended up pointing at a link, then the target directory could change. nsIFile has a Normalize() method that should do the trick, but we need to look at it really closely.

FileSystemUtils::IsDescendantPath doesn't appear to be suitable for security checks like this. For example, I think it would consider "/home/foo/../bar" as a descendant path of "/home/foo". So we'd have to be sure that the paths we're checking are already sanitized and resolved (in terms of links). nsIFile::Normalize() should also help with this, but again we need to look it at carefully.

As mentioned above, this will only work reliably if the paths have been sanitized to not include .. and links.

We support symlinks in Entries API. We must support them.

OK. Sorry, I meant to say that the resolved symlink path should always be used when checking if dir A is a subdirectory of dir B. And we should just resolve the path once.

We want to protect against the case when the content process is compromised and is sending bogus paths in an attempt to be able to write to locations on the filesystem we don't want to allow. A compromised content process could send a path that includes "..".Flags: needinfo?(haftandilian)

Yes, it is. FilePicker always returns a normalized path. Any try to send a non-normalized path ends up with a KillHard().

[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [Bug 1332003](/show_bug.cgi?id=1332003 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash while sending File slice on WebSocket on Windows when File has been obtained via FileSystemDirectoryReader")
[User impact if declined]: In theory, the content process could send a IPC message in order to have read-only access to any existing file.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: yes.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: none
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none
[Is the change risky?]: no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: This patch introduces a new component (FileSystemSecurity) that keeps track of which path has been shared with the content process via FilePicker and/or DataTransfer (Drag&Drop). Any following IPC call, related to Entries API, must match one of these shared paths. The only risk I can imagine is that I have forgotten an entry point for the Entries API, but the patch is well tested and fully green on try. So, no risks.
[String changes made/needed]: none

Discussed this further with :baku and I've filed [Bug 1349276](/show_bug.cgi?id=1349276 "RESOLVED FIXED - Paths received by FileSystemRequestParent need to be sanitized before passed to IsDescendantPath") to be used to address the ".." issue.
