- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When updating a PHOENIX CONTACT mGuard device to Version 8.4.0 using the update-upload facility, the update process resets the password of the "admin" user to its default value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is classified as a Resource Injection (CWE-99), specifically the improper handling of password updates during the firmware update process, leading to a default password being set.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log into the system with administrative privileges, potentially leading to full control of the device and the network it protects.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning that an attacker can exploit it over a network connection. The specific attack vector involves exploiting the software update mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected device and knowledge that the device has been updated to vulnerable version 8.4.0. Exploitation requires low skill level.
