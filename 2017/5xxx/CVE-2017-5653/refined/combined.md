=== Content from cxf.apache.org_7423de04_20250125_134628.html ===
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256
CVE-2017-5653: Apache CXF JAX-RS XML Security streaming clients do not validate that the service response was signed or encrypted.
Severity: Moderate
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected:
This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.1.11 and
3.0.13.
Description:
Apache CXF supports the ability to use XML Signature and encryption to secure
JAX-RS services. Two different implementations are available, a DOM based
approach that works on a model of the message in memory before applying
security, and a streaming based implementation that is a useful alternative
for larger messages.
There is a bug in validating messages for JAX-RS clients using the streaming
approach, where it will not enforce that the message is signed and/or
encrypted. An exception is thrown in these cases but not properly propagated
to the client code. The bug does not apply for the DOM clients and it does not
apply for the streaming server side case.
This has been fixed in revision:
https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cxf.git;a=commit;h=fade9b81dabe27f864ca38e7b40f28fb44d6f165
Migration:
Apache CXF users should upgrade to 3.1.11 or 3.0.13 or later as soon as
possible. In addition, instead of adding the JAX-RS XmlSecInInterceptor to the
CXF in-interceptor chain for the client, it is necessary to add it as a
JAX-RS provider instead.

# RHSA-2017:1832 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R4 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the hawtio servlet uses a single HttpClient instance to proxy requests with a persistent cookie store (cookies are stored locally and are not passed between the client and the end URL) which means all clients using that proxy are sharing the same cookies. (CVE-2017-2589)
* It was found that an information disclosure flaw in Bouncy Castle could enable a local malicious application to gain access to user's private information. (CVE-2015-6644)
* It was found that Apache Camel's camel-jackson and camel-jacksonxml components are vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues. (CVE-2016-8749)
* It was found that Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded / to a request an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. (CVE-2016-9879)
* It was found that a path traversal vulnerability in hawtio leads to a NullPointerException with a full stacktrace. An attacker could use this flaw to gather undisclosed information from within hawtio's root. (CVE-2017-2594)
* It was found that Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code is not using a constant time MAC signature comparison algorithm which may be exploited by some sophisticated timing attacks. It may only affect OAuth2 Hawk, JWT access tokens, or JOSE JWS/JWE interceptors which depend on HMAC secret key algorithms. (CVE-2017-3156)
* It was found that Apache Camel's validation component evaluates DTD headers of XML stream sources, although a validation against XML schemas (XSD) is executed. Remote attackers can use this feature to make Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by sending XML documents with remote DTDs URLs or XML External Entities (XXE). (CVE-2017-5643)
* It was found that a flaw exists in JAX-RS clients using the streaming approach for XML signatures and encryption, where it does not enforce the message to be signed/encrypted. This could allow an attacker to subvert the integrity of the message. (CVE-2017-5653)
* It was found that the token cacher in Apache cxf uses a flawed way of caching tokens that are associated with the delegation token received from Security Token Service (STS). This vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a token which could return an identifier corresponding to a cached token for another user. (CVE-2017-5656)
* It was found that logback is vulnerable to a deserialization issue. Logback can be configured to allow remote logging through SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interfaces that can accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code through deserialization of custom gadget chains. (CVE-2017-5929)
* It was found that XStream contains a vulnerability that allows a maliciously crafted file to be parsed successfully which could cause an application crash. The crash occurs if the file that is being fed into XStream input stream contains an instances of the primitive type 'void'. An attacker could use this flaw to create a denial of service on the target system. (CVE-2017-7957)

The CVE-2017-2589 issue was discovered by Adam Willard (Blue Canopy) and Dennis Reed (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-2594 issue was discovered by Hooman Broujerdi (Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1445329#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-04-25 13:44:28 UTC  ``` An Apache CXF endpoint can be used as an intermediary, where a token credential from the received message is used as a delegation token to obtain a new token from a Security Token Service (STS) for the outbound request.  By default, the token retrieved from the STS is cached and associated with the delegation token via an identifier extracted from the delegation token.   However, there is a weakness in how the identifier is extracted from the delegation token, which means that an attacker could craft a token which  would return an identifer corresponding to a cached token for another user.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1445327#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-04-25 13:40:58 UTC  ```  Apache CXF supports the ability to use XML Signature and encryption to secure JAX-RS services. Two different implementations are available, a DOM based  approach that works on a model of the message in memory before applying security, and a streaming based implementation that is a useful alternative for larger messages.  There is a bug in validating messages for JAX-RS clients using the streaming approach, where it will not enforce that the message is signed and/or encrypted. An exception is thrown in these cases but not properly propagated to the client code. The bug does not apply for the DOM clients and it does not apply for the streaming server side case.
