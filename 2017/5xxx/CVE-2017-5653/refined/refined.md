{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a bug in Apache CXF's JAX-RS XML Security streaming client implementation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The streaming client does not enforce that the service response was signed and/or encrypted."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could subvert the integrity of the message.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could send a crafted unsigned or unencrypted response to a vulnerable client.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to intercept or control the server response."
  },
    "affected_products": [
        "Apache CXF prior to 3.1.11 and 3.0.13",
        "Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3",
        "Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3"
    ],
    "fixes": [
        "Upgrade to Apache CXF 3.1.11 or 3.0.13 or later",
        "Add the JAX-RS XmlSecInInterceptor as a JAX-RS provider instead of the CXF in-interceptor chain"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability only applies to the streaming client implementation, not the DOM based clients or server-side implementations. An exception is thrown when the validation fails but not properly propagated to the client code."
