Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **information exposure** through specific URL parameters, allowing arbitrary destination addresses to be specified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** The software exposes credentials to external systems by accepting arbitrary destination addresses through URL parameters. This allows an attacker to potentially redirect the application to send credentials to an attacker controlled system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, specifically user credentials, to external and potentially malicious entities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the use of specific, crafted URL parameters. An adjacent attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to be on the same network or have the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in Wonderware InTouch Access Anywhere, version 11.5.2 and prior.
* Schneider Electric assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 to this vulnerability.
* The CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) indicating an adjacent attack vector, low attack complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction, no change to scope, high impact to confidentiality, no impact to integrity, and no impact to availability.
