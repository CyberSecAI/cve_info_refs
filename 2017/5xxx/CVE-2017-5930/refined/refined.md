Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5930:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the `AliasHandler` component of PostfixAdmin. Specifically, the `delete()` function within `AliasHandler.php` did not properly verify if a domain administrator had the right to delete a given alias.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authorization Check:** The core issue is the lack of an authorization check before deleting aliases. This allows domain administrators to bypass intended restrictions and delete aliases they shouldn't have access to.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The `delete.php` script directly used the `delete` parameter from the request URL to identify the alias to delete, without validating if the requesting user had the appropriate permissions for that alias.
- **Insecure direct object manipulation**: Attackers can directly manipulate the `delete` parameter in the URL to delete arbitrary aliases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Alias Deletion:** A malicious domain administrator could delete protected aliases, such as `abuse@domain.com`, which might be set up by the server administrator to receive important emails. This could lead to a denial of service by preventing delivery of email to the specified alias.
- **Potential for Data Loss/Interruption:** Deleting critical aliases can disrupt email flow, potentially causing important messages to be lost or delayed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `delete` parameter of the `delete.php` script through the web interface.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** A domain admin could craft a URL with the `delete` parameter set to the protected alias and then visit this crafted URL while logged in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Domain Administrator:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in domain administrator within PostfixAdmin.
- **Access to PostfixAdmin Interface:** The attacker needs access to the PostfixAdmin web interface.
- **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** Attacker needs to understand that `delete` parameter is vulnerable and can be directly manipulated.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in PostfixAdmin version 3.0.2 by adding a check `if (! $this->can_delete)` in the `delete()` function within `AliasHandler.php`. This check ensures that an alias can only be deleted if the user has the necessary permissions.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Janfred and the fix was implemented by cboltz.
