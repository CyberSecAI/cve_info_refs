  "additional_notes": "The content provides more detailed information than the official CVE description, including specific vulnerable endpoints, exploit code, and affected models. The document also clarifies that CVE-2017-5892 is related to the JSONP information disclosure requiring login, which was initially incorrectly assigned to the JSONP disclosure without login. This has been fixed in the content. It also indicates that the vendor initially didn't consider the JSONP issues as a security threat, but later agreed to fix them."
