Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5249:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OAuth token used by the Wink Android application to authorize user access was stored unencrypted in the file `/data/data/com.quirky.android.wink.wink/shared_prefs/user.xml`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure storage of sensitive information (OAuth token) in cleartext on the device's file system. This violates CWE-922.
- Lack of encryption for the stored authentication token.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor who gains access to the user's Android device (through loss, theft, or malware) could extract the unencrypted OAuth token.
- This token would allow the attacker to gain full remote access to the user's Wink Hub 2 and control connected devices.
- The attacker could potentially control lights, locks, and other smart home devices.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the user's unlocked Android device.
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities on the Android device leading to unauthorized access to files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to gain access to the user's Android device file system, either through physical access or exploitation.
- No network access to the Wink Hub is needed once the OAuth token is obtained.
