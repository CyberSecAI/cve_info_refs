Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5250:

**Vulnerability:** Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information

**Root Cause:**
The Insteon Android application stores sensitive information, specifically the account and password for both Insteon services and the Hub hardware, unencrypted in a shared preferences file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unencrypted storage of sensitive credentials (account username and password) within the application's shared preferences file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker gaining access to the device's filesystem can extract the unencrypted credentials and use them to gain unauthorized control of the Insteon Hub and connected devices. This allows an attacker to control the victim's smart home devices, potentially including security-related devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the Android device where the Insteon application is installed and used.
- Malware installed on the Android device with access to the application's data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the user's unlocked Android device or the ability to compromise the device through malware to access the shared preferences file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable file is located at `/data/data/com.insteon.insteon3/shared_prefs/com.insteon.insteon3_preferences.xml`.
- The stored credentials remain unencrypted until the user manually logs out.
- The credentials stored include both the user's Insteon service credentials and hub hardware credentials.
- The blog post recommends using full-disk encryption (FDE) as a mitigative measure, if available.
- The vendor was notified and the vulnerability remains unpatched at the time of this post.
