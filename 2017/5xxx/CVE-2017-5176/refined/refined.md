Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5176:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue present in Rockwell Automation's Connected Components Workbench (CCW) software. Certain DLLs included with the software can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL Hijacking (CWE-427):** The software loads DLLs in an insecure manner, allowing an attacker to substitute a malicious DLL for a legitimate one.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malicious DLL could cause the software to malfunction or crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Malicious Code Injection:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary malicious code into the trusted CCW process by using a malicious DLL.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The malicious code could run with the privileges of the user running CCW and potentially escalate to computer administrator privileges, compromising the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the victim's computer. The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL where the vulnerable software will load it instead of the legitimate one.
- **User Interaction:** The user would likely need to launch or interact with the affected software for the exploit to trigger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Ability to place a malicious DLL:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable CCW application will load it. This is a necessary step before the application is run by the user.
- **Relatively high skill level:** The exploit is not trivial and requires a moderate degree of technical knowledge to craft the malicious DLL and achieve the intended results.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory specifies that no known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 7.0 with a vector string of AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating that it is a local attack, with high impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The high attack complexity means it is not simple to execute an exploit for this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
- Rockwell Automation has released updated versions of Connected Components Workbench (v10.00 and v10.01) that address this vulnerability.
- Users are advised to update to these latest versions.
- General security recommendations include:
    - Minimizing network exposure of control systems.
    - Placing control system networks behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
    - Using secure methods such as VPNs for remote access.
