Addition in drbg.c for the internal state V doesn't correctly carry bits over.
This was independently discovered by Vladimir Klebanov (Karlsruher Institute of Technology) and myself.

Talked to Franziskus on IRC about this. It's likely to get backported to 3.30 as well before that goes final (which will then find its way into Fx54). It's less clear whether it'll get backported to 3.29 (Fx53) or 3.28 (ESR52) at this point.

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer
overflows and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, information disclosure or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.9.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.9.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](#c0)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-04-19 18:20:47 UTC  ``` From <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2017-11/>   CVE-2017-5461: Out-of-bounds write in Base64 encoding in NSS  Impact     critical  Description  An out-of-bounds write during Base64 decoding operation in the Network Security Services (NSS) library due to insufficient memory being allocated to the buffer. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. The NSS library has been updated to fix this issue to address this issue and Firefox ESR 45.9 has been updated with NSS version 3.21.4. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Ian Stakenvicius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-04-19 18:27:08 UTC  ``` 3.21.x has long been dropped from the gentoo repo, however I don't know what other versions of NSS may be affected.  The CVE hasn't actually been filed yet so i guess we will have to wait. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-04-19 18:29:46 UTC  ``` Right, keep in mind that NSS version schema is complicated: I.e. just because 3.28.1 is higher than 3.21.4 you cannot be sure that it contains all the fixes from 3.21.4.  So yes, we have to wait for more information. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ian Stakenvicius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-04-19 20:25:44 UTC  ``` Addressed in >=dev-libs/nss-3.29.5 and >=dev-libs/nss-3.30.1  Arches, please stabilize dev-libs/nss-3.29.5 for target KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 arm arm64 hppa ia64 ppc ppc64" ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tobias Klausmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-04-22 07:37:11 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-04-22 13:19:46 UTC  ``` Stable for HPPA. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2017-04-23 10:32:48 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2017-04-27 10:42:09 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2017-04-27 11:29:03 UTC  ``` sparc stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2017-04-29 15:06:02 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2017-04-30 09:40:01 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2017-04-30 13:50:58 UTC  ``` Remaining arches are not part of security supported architectures, please stabilize when you have a chance.

Attached file
[httpindex1.php](attachment.cgi?id=8843567)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8843567&action=edit)

Steps to reproduce:
--------------------
1. Build firefox with valgrind using instructions mentioned in
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Testing/Valgrind>
2. Download and copy httpindex1.php and httpindex2.php to local web server.
Web server should support PHP.
3. Start firefox
\* Enable Multi-process option should be disabled in firefox.
Otherwise firefox tab crash due to some other valgrind errors.
export VALGRIND\_OPTIONS="--smc-check=all-non-file --vex-iropt-register-updates=allregs-at-mem-access --show-mismatched-frees=no --read-inline-info=yes"
./mach run --debugger="valgrind" --debugger-args="$VALGRIND\_OPTIONS"
4. Visit httpindex1.php or httpindex2.php
Valgrind will display error. Valgrind output is attached under Crash Signature.
Cause of bug
-------------
Bug is in nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method of netwerk\streamconv\converters\nsDirIndexParser.cpp file.
"mFormat" int array created by this method can contain uninitialized value due to 2 reasons.
1. "http-index-format" content does not contain any format values.
ex: 200:\r\n
201:a\r\n
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method creates an int array with 2 elements for "mFormat", even though there are no values in format line.
2. "http-index-format" content contains invalid values.
ex: 200:a a a
201:a a a
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method creates an int array with 4 elements for "mFormat", even though there are invalid values in format line.

Can you double-check that you have this commit in the Firefox build you run: <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/5ef67e15fd88> (originates from [bug 1344461](/show_bug.cgi?id=1344461 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap buffer overflow in nsDirIndexParser::ParseData")) I can't seem to reproduce any crashes using this recipe!

I checked again and commit was present.
Test case does not crash Firefox. But Valgrind shows "uninitialised value" error.
Valgrind shows this error only when "Enable multi-process Nightly" option is disabled.
But I don't think is bug is related to "Multi-process" option.

Comment on new test case (httpindex3.php)
-----------------------------------------
Bug fix (Below mentioned) correctly fixes initially attached test cases (httpindex1.php and httpindex2.php).
nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat method ->
mFormat[num] = -1;
+ mFormat[0] = -1; // to detect zero header fields
nsDirIndexParser::ParseData mehtod ->
+ if (mFormat[0] == -1) {
+ // no known header fields is an error
+ return NS\_ERROR\_ILLEGAL\_VALUE;
+ }
But fix can be bypassed, when first format value is valid and following format values are invalid.
ex:
<?php
header("Content-Type:application/http-index-format");
echo "200:Filename a a\r\n";
echo "201:a a a\r\n";

Thanks for the additional data.
The mFormat[] array that is filled in with identifier integers could end up with uninitialized array entries if a correct header field was followed by an incorrect one. This patch now sets all types to -1 first so that a mismatch will leave it initialized to the "unknown" type.

0001-bug-1344467-clear-the-format-type-for-unknown-types-.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Hard. It is easy to cause an access of uninitialized memory, but hard to take advantage of.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not very clearly, no
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This bug has been around in all code since October 2001.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The same patch should work on all branches
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Low risk due to the small size and minimal logical change.

Here's take 2. The previous version could still break out of the loop before the assignment and then cause reads of uninitialized data. I feel rather confident with this version.
There's try run going at <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=4cbdc417d41a93eadd61c89d745c763b1a7b7fdd&selectedJob=87789473> which unfortunately has an unusually large amount of intermittents.

Take 3.
Turns out fixing this bug triggered a different flow later on that caused test regressions. nsDirIndexParser::ParseData() really can't be allowed to return failure even for bad input as that then skips the necessary call to mListener->OnIndexAvailable().
This version of the patch makes changes ParseData() to still return on bad input, but return NS\_OK.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Marcia Knous, David Baron, Mats Palmgren, Ronald Crane, Bob Clary, and Chris Peterson reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0
Build ID: 20160502172042
Steps to reproduce:
(Only tested on Mac OS X).
A simple click on the location bar can lead to a Location Bar Spoofing (URL and SSL Spoofing).
Explication:
If an user click on the location bar and the ONBLUR event defines that the actual URL changes its size by a bigger size, (eg: <http://www.yyy.com/> becomes <http://www.yyy.com/#wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhttps://www.bank.com/> ) , the end of the URL is shown instead of the start of this URL (so the location bar shows <https://www.bank.com> instead of <http://www.yyy.com/># ).
-A demonstration video will be uploaded.
1) Open with Firefox "PoC v1 Part1.html" and click on the button "Step 1: ClickMe"
(a popup window is opened)
2) Click on the location bar
Actual results:
The Location Bar is Spoofed and if the Malicious WebSite is secure , this leads to URL And SSL Spoofing
Expected results:
If an user click on the location bar and the ONBLUR event defines that the actual URL changes its size by a bigger size, the end of the URL is shown instead of the start of this URL.
Possible way to patch this vulnerability :
When an user click on the location bar , Firefox should continue to show the start of the visited URL instead of the end of this URL.

Yeah. This similarly exploits the fact that blur() is synchronously dispatched to the page, but uses a different technique to trick the URL bar.
E10s mitigates the problem by making blur async from the point of view of the page, but it's unclear if some of these can also randomly work by lucky timing.
I'll leave the needinfo a little bit more to take a look soon and see if there's a simple solution to this. But the patch for [bug 1272961](/show_bug.cgi?id=1272961 "NEW") won't fix this one.

A quick fix would be make to the XULBrowserWindow#onLocationChange async, given that the side effect of e10s conveniently fix this.
Alternatively, I can change the implementation of the onLocationChange in the object returned by tabbrowser.mTabProgressListener. That would make all the progress listeners it calls async, including the aforementioned one.
It would be better if we could keep the patch uplift-able by keeping it small and introduces a behavior that is similar to e10s so tests won't fail.

Hmm this feels very risky. I'd expect tests to fail with this, did you send it to try yet? Granted, in e10s this is async from the point of view of the content, but on the parent the callers are still used to this being sync. Like, I've seen code in the past that relies on some of these attributes being set/unset right after OnLocationChange ends. Specially things related to the URL bar mode (displaying url / inputting url).
I'm not opposed to giving this a try but I'd be happier with a more specific fix. Let's see a try run and then think about landing it. In any case, I'd not want this to skip trains..

You are right. Any changes that changes timing doesn't look pretty on test results. Here is another approach that only changes the timing of gURLBar attributes change, and PopupNotifications.anchorVisibilityChange().
It certainly breaks less tests. Do you agree with this approach? If so I will start fixing tests ...

This looks like it's almost certainly wrong because gBrowser.selectedBrowser can change (sometimes because of actions the website takes) inbetween when we call URLBarSetURI and when it resolves, and URLBarSetURI does rely on what the selected browser is.
It seems to me a much simpler fix would be to ensure we end up setting the start and end of the selection to the start of the URL when the URL changes in the codepath used in the testcase/poc. See [bug 1114343](/show_bug.cgi?id=1114343 "RESOLVED FIXED - Origin spoofing when URL is copied to the URL bar"), where (a) I was probably right that there are spoofing issues (viz. this bug) and (b) we probably put the selectionStart/End setting in the wrong place. It's tricky to get that right, though, as we don't want the website having control over selection in the navbar (cf. [bug 1199934](/show_bug.cgi?id=1199934 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox allows site to prevent address bar editing (by repeatedly setting location.hash)")).

In this testcase, focus doesn't leave the URL bar. But yes, this is essentially what I suggested in [comment #11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1273537#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - A click into the location bar can lead to a Location Bar Spoofing vulnerability (URL and SSL Spoofing) using the onblur event and change the URL size by a bigger URL size.").

I don't think scrollLeft is involved here - nothing is scrolling - you should manipulate the selection.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Actually it did. The fake login page calls alert() which takes the focus away.
Even if it didn't, user would need move the focus back to the page manually to start typing credentials...

I don't understand this. I tried |this.inputField.scrollLeft = 0| and it did scroll the input. Are you saying I shouldn't be using it?
Also, do we need an UX decision here? Base domain is certainly important from security point of view, but for users being able to see the path changes between navigation might be more important...

[Make sure base domain is visible](attachment.cgi?id=8840312) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8840312&action=edit)

This patch sets scrollLeft in formatValue() to ensure base domain is always visible. Specifically for the attack described here, the attacker's domain will be shown (instead of the fake domain in the hash) when the focus moves away from the url bar to the alert prompt.
This is not fool proof; we do not reset scroll position on other occasions, like when user manually scroll the url bar with mouse wheel without focus it, and/or when the window is resized.
If we want to dig deeper and ensure the url don't scroll when it's being focused, this is where it should take place:

But that's not a fundamental part of the poc/exploit here - it's not important and we shouldn't rely on it for 'fixing' things.

By which time the user is already not looking at the url bar anymore so it's too late.

That's surprising. :-\
> Are you saying I shouldn't be using it?
Probably not, because it looks like it just scrolls the insertion/selection point out of view. So if focus is left in the url bar, text might still be selected but the user can't see it (or the cursor is hidden... which sounds like a bug if we allow it to happen at all, tbh).

We already do the 'scroll to the left' thing if you navigate in the URL bar by hitting enter, and anything else going through openLinkIn, IIRC, so I don't think so.

Make sure base domain is visible
This is overly complex, so f- for that. We should just set the main input's selectionStart and selectionEnd to 0 like we do elsewhere (and the other code should probably be moved to wherever we end up doing it instead).
Just showing the base domain is not enough anyway because the protocol should be visible too, otherwise things remain spoofable e.g. for javascript: or data: URLs which don't technically have domains but can be made to look like they have domains if we only show a substring of the domain.
The tricky thing is \*where\* to do it, and I can't tell if this is the right place without more information. It \*looks\* like this is the code that runs when we do highlighting of the base domain, ie when the location bar is blurred, in which case this is too late as I said in my previous comment. Anyway, the patch context doesn't even include the method name. So for the next patch, please can you explain where you are doing this and why is that the right place?

Ah, I now saw that you did this in the other comment, which I missed - sorry. But as I said, I don't think this is the right place.

Attached patch

[URLBarSetURI-selectionStart.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8840767&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8840767&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1273537&attachment=8840767)

After giving it a thought on where to reset the caret position, I've come to the conclusion that the right place to put this would be simply URLBarSetURI() in browser.js. This the the only other place where we rewrite the entire URL by setting the .value (the first place being gURLBar#\_loadURL). With this patch and [bug 1114343](/show_bug.cgi?id=1114343 "RESOLVED FIXED - Origin spoofing when URL is copied to the URL bar") both call to setter of .value will reset the caret position.
There is nothing to check (e.g. if the bar is focused etc.) here when reset the caret position. The code that eventually calls URLBarSetURI() is responsible of making sure of that, given it rewrites the value (e.g. [bug 1199934](/show_bug.cgi?id=1199934 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox allows site to prevent address bar editing (by repeatedly setting location.hash)")).

URLBarSetURI-selectionStart.patch
At a glance, this looks OK. I haven't tested this, though. Please remember to remove the other place I referenced where we do this if that makes sense (or maybe it doesn't?). Do tests in the browser/base/content/test/urlbar/ directory pass for you locally with this change?
I should have cycles to test this tomorrow, but I'm aware that because of the time difference early feedback might be useful.

This isn't quite true, because in some cases we will call URLBarSetURI multiple times with the same value. You can see this in action fairly easily when loading e.g. yahoo.com (which is slow to load if you're not using an adblocker or TP). If you turn off browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll (if you're on a platform where that's true) and load yahoo.com, then click toward the end of the URL bar after "<https://uk.yahoo.com/?p=us>" appears as the URL, you can see focus is initially towards the end and then gets switched to index 0 (by the code you're adding).
We should avoid that.
I ran tests locally, and it looks like your changes break browser/base/content/test/urlbar/browser\_bug304198.js and browser\_canonizeURL.js
I believe both tests can be fixed by changing the patch so it only updates the selection for cases where there's no typed value (and we use either currentURI or a passed-in URI) and where the value is different from the URL bar's current value. So change the selection inside the extant if statement and only do so if gURLBar.value is different from the value we're going to set (at the end of the if block).
Doing that seems to fix both tests for me. I'd still like to know if this means we can remove the other selection setting code as I asked earlier.Flags: needinfo?(felipc)

... though that doesn't seem to fix the problem in the testcase completely, because it updates the selection before assigning to .value. Fixing up this patch so it doesn't do that reintroduces problems with the tests I mentioned in [comment #21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1273537#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - A click into the location bar can lead to a Location Bar Spoofing vulnerability (URL and SSL Spoofing) using the onblur event and change the URL size by a bigger URL size."), but does seem to fix the manual yahoo testcase in my testing. I expect the tests can be fixed by manually fixing assumptions they make about the insertion point in the URL bar.

Why does this use gURLBar.textValue and the other test fix use gURLBar.value ? Which one is right, and can we make them match?

Both getter eventually gets the value of gURLBar.inputField.value. I simply want to make the change consistent of the setter in the test files.
I've update the line in browser\_canonizeURL.js to |gURLBar.inputField.value.length| given the next line sets |gURLBar.inputField.value| directly\*.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Should not be easy. The patch changes the position of caret (thus, scroll position of the URL bar text) when the user first focused on the URL bar. It does not specifically workaround the attack (which rely on timing of URL rewrite and scroll position).
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No tests was added in the patch. No commit comment.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Yes, see flags.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Backports would need to be created for test changes, but not the code change itself. It shouldn't be hard to do it.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Tests in browser/base/content/test/urlbar/ all passes locally. The worse regression could happen would be unexpected moves of the URL bar caret.

Ah, wait, don't we need to also check that the value is changing (ie check gURLBar.value != value, before we set it of course...)?

Yeah, I just checked and I can still reproduce it. This should do to fix it:

"Yes" is an answer to "Which?" No... The status flags for affected versions are empty. How far back does this go?

Sorry, I should say "Version".
Given that it's being filed against 46 branch I would say this affects all the way to release, and maybe currently supported ESRs.

We need to determine whether this affects ESR45 or not. This is high enough rated that, if it does, we would take it on that branch.

You only need to ask for sec-approval for trunk patches. I suspect you want to ask for Aurora, Beta, and ESR45 or 52 approvals on these patches. That is what you need for checkins on those branches.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Not sure, probably not a regression.
[User impact if declined]: See the POC phishing attack described in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1273537#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - A click into the location bar can lead to a Location Bar Spoofing vulnerability (URL and SSL Spoofing) using the onblur event and change the URL size by a bigger URL size.")
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: No test was added to avoid drawing a target.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Not landed yet and only verified locally.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: No need for manually test I think. The possible regression should not be critical.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None.
[Is the change risky?]: No.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: The change is localized and possible regression should not be critical.
[String changes made/needed]: No.

Though this got re-rated to sec-moderate, it would be nice to fix. This should land for beta 5 or 6 depending on when we go to build today.
