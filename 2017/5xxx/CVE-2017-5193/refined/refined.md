Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5193:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing NULL check before calling the `nick_comp_func` function within the `irc_query_find` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code directly uses the `nick` pointer without ensuring it's not NULL. If a server sends a message without a nick, a NULL pointer is passed to `nick_comp_func`, leading to a dereference and crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a crash of the Irssi client, effectively leading to a denial of service. The client becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **IRC Server Control:** An attacker needs control over an IRC server to send a crafted message without a nick which triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to control or manipulate messages sent by an IRC server to the client. Specifically, they must be able to send a message that lacks a nick, causing the `nick` pointer to be NULL.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all observed versions of Irssi prior to the fix.
*   The fix is included in Irssi version 0.8.21 and 1.0.0.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `irc_query_find` function, which attempts to retrieve an existing query using the `nick_comp_func`.
*   The issue occurs because a message with a NULL nick is not handled, resulting in the `nick_comp_func` being called with a NULL pointer.
*   The official fix commit can be found here: https://github.com/irssi/irssi/commit/6c6c42e3d1b49d90aacc0b67f8540471cae02a1d.
* Debian LTS also fixed the vulnerability: DLA 1217-1
* Gentoo also issued a GLSA to address it: GLSA 201701-45
