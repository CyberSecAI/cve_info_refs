Subject: CVE request Qemu: audio: memory leakage in es1370 device

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the ES1370 audio device emulation support is
vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while doing a device
unplug operation; Doing so repeatedly would result in leaking host memory,
affecting other services on the host.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to cause a DoS and/or
potentially crash the Qemu process on the host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
  -> <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-01/msg01742.html>

Reference:
----------
  -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414209>

This issue was reported by Mr Lo Qiang of 360.cn Inc.

Thank you.

Use CVE-2017-5526 for this (i.e., a memory consumption issue, not an
information disclosure issue).
