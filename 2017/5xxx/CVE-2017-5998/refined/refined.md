The provided content includes detailed information about CVE-2017-5998.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Intersect Alliance Snare web application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they view the log configuration page. In the provided example, the injected javascript requests a password which is then echoed back.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Log File" field within the "Generic log format (default)" log type in the web admin portal under "Log Configuration" > "Add." When a user views the modified log configuration, the stored XSS payload executes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires access to the web admin portal of the Intersect Alliance Snare application. The attacker must be able to add a new log configuration.
