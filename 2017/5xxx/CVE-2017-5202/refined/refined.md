{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in the `clnp_print()` function within `print-isoclns.c`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted network packet"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted network packet to a system running tcpdump.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists within the ISO CLNP (Connectionless Network Protocol) packet processing logic. By sending a malformed packet, an attacker can trigger a buffer overflow within the `clnp_print()` function, potentially leading to a crash, or arbitrary code execution."
