Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a default system account included in the embedded Tableau Server within Schneider Electric's Wonderware Intelligence software. This default account is difficult to modify to use non-default credentials after installation, and the process for changing it is not documented.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Credentials Management:** The core issue is the use of a default system account with easily exploitable credentials when using local authentication mode.
*   **Lack of Documentation:** The lack of documentation on how to change the default credentials exacerbates the issue, leaving users vulnerable without clear guidance on mitigation.
*   **Default Credentials:** The presence of a default account with known credentials poses a significant security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to administrator level.
*   **Full System Control:** With administrator access, an attacker gains the ability to take complete control over the host machine where the vulnerable Tableau Server is installed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, requiring network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Local Authentication Mode:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the Tableau Server is used with local authentication instead of Windows integrated security (Active Directory).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable system over the network.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory indicates that the exploit is of low skill level. This suggests that the default credentials could be readily available or easily guessable and the exploitation process is not complex.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The CVSS vector indicates that no prior privileges are needed (`PR:N`) for exploitation.
