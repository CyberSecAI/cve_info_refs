Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5940:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2017-5940. The Gentoo security advisory explicitly mentions CVE-2017-5940 as a vulnerability related to an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-5180 in Firejail. The commit logs and mailing list discussions also point towards this CVE being addressed in subsequent Firejail releases, specifically commit `38d4185` and `903fd8a`, the latter of which serves as a backport.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2017-5180). The initial fix didn't fully address the underlying issue, allowing an attacker to bypass sandbox protections, potentially leading to privilege escalation. This is indicated by the email thread where the maintainers state that "Changing .Xauthority to .bashrc in the exploit code, the problem is still there".

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary vulnerability lies in how Firejail handles file creation and copying within the sandboxed environment, specifically:
   - The `skel()` function, responsible for copying skeleton files (`.zshrc`, `.cshrc`, `.bashrc`) from `/etc/skel` to the user's home directory inside the sandbox. It had a TOCTOU (Time-of-check-time-of-use) issue with how it handles symlinks and regular files.
  - Copying of `.Xauthority` and `.asoundrc` files to the sandbox environment, specifically that symlinks are not being handled correctly when copying these files.
   -  Incorrect permissions being set when creating these files.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
   - Bypass Firejail's sandbox protection.
   - Potentially cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
   - Escalate privileges to gain root access.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is primarily local. An attacker would need to have access to a user account on the system where Firejail is running. The attacker could then leverage the vulnerabilities in file copying during sandbox creation to gain higher privileges.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker must be a local user on the system.
   - The attacker needs to have the ability to execute programs using Firejail.
   - An understanding of how Firejail handles file system operations and potentially knowledge of the exploit used in CVE-2017-5180.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content reveals that the vulnerability is related to the improper handling of symlinks during file cloning inside the sandbox environment which would allow writing outside the sandboxed directory.
- The patches aim to rectify the incomplete fix, enforce proper permission settings, and introduce checks to prevent symlink exploitation. The patch also aims to do file copies as the sandboxed user, not as root.
- There is also reference to a TOCTOU (Time-of-check-time-of-use) vulnerability in regards to copying files as the regular user, fixed by making a copy as a regular user immediately after creating a file as root.
