Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The dotCMS application directly reads data from HTTP requests and reflects it back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization. This allows for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. User-supplied input, specifically the `direction` parameter in the `/about-us/locations/index` URL, is reflected in the response without being sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's response. When a victim's browser renders the response, the malicious script will execute.
*   This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `direction` parameter: `/about-us/locations/index?direction=testlr68w"onfocus%3d"alert(1)"autofocus%3d"d0mt3&milesR=500`.
*   The attacker would need to entice a victim to click this malicious URL, such as through a phishing scheme.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need authentication.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to distribute the crafted URL and convince the victim to visit it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes links to OWASP's XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, which suggests that the vulnerability should be addressed by proper input sanitization or output encoding.
*   The vulnerability is present in dotCMS version 3.7.0.
*   The issue was reported on February 6, 2017.
*   The severity is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS v3 score of 6.1.

The specific vulnerable URL is:
```
/about-us/locations/index?direction=testlr68w"onfocus%3d"alert(1)"autofocus%3d"d0mt3&milesR=500
```
where the `direction` parameter contains the XSS payload.
