Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-5790:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the `AccessMgrServlet.java` component of HPE Intelligent Management Center (IMC). Specifically, the code deserializes an object directly from the request input stream without proper authentication or authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes data from a client-controlled input stream without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
*   **Bypass of Authentication:** The code attempts to check if a user is logged in but ignores the exception thrown if the user is not, and then proceeds with deserialization. This bypasses the intended login requirements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By sending a crafted malicious serialized object, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This is because the server has vulnerable libraries on the classpath like Commons-Beanutils, Jython, and JSON-lib that can be used to construct a malicious object.
*   **Remote File Manipulation:** The presence of the Commons-FileUpload library could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the web interface of HPE IMC.
*   **Specific Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is `/imc/fault/accessMgrServlet`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Send Network Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests containing malicious serialized Java objects to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Tenable advisory mentions that the database setup for iMC is complex.
*   Tenable discovered this issue while writing a detection plugin for CVE-2016-4372, which also involved deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   The exploit PoC mentioned, `exploit_accessMgrServlet.py`, is Windows-centric.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in HPE Intelligent Management Center Platform 7.3 (E0504).
