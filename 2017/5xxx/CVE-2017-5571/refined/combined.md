# Schneider Electric Floating License Manager

Last RevisedMay 24, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-18-144-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION**: Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor**: Schneider Electric
* **Equipment**: Floating License Manager
* **Vulnerabilities**: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Open Redirect

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause a denial of service, allow arbitrary execution of code with system level privileges, or send users to arbitrary websites.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following products use the vulnerable Schneider Electric Floating License Manager, a license management platform:

* SCADA Expert Vijeo Citect / CitectSCADA Version 7.30, 7.40,
* CitectSCADA Version 2015, 2016,

* CitectHistorian Version 2016,
* Citect Anywhere,
* PlantStruxure PES V4.3 SP1 and prior, and
* EcoStruxure Modicon Builder V3.0 and prior.

The following products are only affected by CVE-2016-10395:

* EcoStruxure Power Monitoring Expert 8.2 (Standard, DC, HC Editions),
* StruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert 8.1 (Standard, DC, HC Editions),
* StruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert 8.0 (Standard, DC, HC, Buildings Editions),
* StruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert 7.2.x,
* Energy Expert 1.x (formerly Power Manager), and
* EcoStruxure Power SCADA Operations 8.x (formerly PowerSCADA Expert) (Only with Advanced Reports and Dashboards Module).

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### 3.2.1 [HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)

OpenSSL incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks, which may allow denial of service attacks or other unspecified behavior.

[CVE-2016-2177](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2177) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.2.2 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

This vulnerability can be exploited to cause an out-of-bounds memory read access, which may allow remote code execution with system privileges.

[CVE-2016-10395](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10395) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.2.3 [URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE-601](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)

An open redirect vulnerability has been identified, which may allow remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary websites for phishing attacks.

[CVE-2017-5571](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5571) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Schneider Electric reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Schneider Electric recommends that users of affected Citect and PlantStruxure products download and install the new version of the software located at:

<https://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/documents/downloads/Floating_License_Manager_v2.1.0.0.zip>

Users using EcoStruxure Modicon Builder V3.0 are recommended to download and use the new version (V3.1) located at:

<https://partner.schneider-electric.com/partners/Menu/MyPartnership> (login required)

StructureWare 7.2.x users should upgrade to Version 7.2.2 and apply the floating licensing manager (FLM) patch from the following location:

<https://schneider-electric.box.com/s/n2fh1ym594pqvl87kf0zjsigamuryrje>

EcoStruxure/StruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert and Power SCADA Operations users need to upgrade to Version 8.2. Energy Expert users need to upgrade to Version 1.3. Once these are upgraded apply the Cumulative Update (CU) 2 located at:

<https://schneider-electric.box.com/s/kkdikodcksjj1dznqy68ko0j28wct7vb>

Schneider Electric has also released security notifications which contain further details and upgrade instructions at the following links:

<https://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/safety-and-security-central/36-security-notifications/9134-vulnerabilities-within-schneider-electric-floating-license-manager>

<https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-137-01/>

<https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-144-01/>

<https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-046-01/>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
