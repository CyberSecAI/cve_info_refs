- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `updater-script` in OnePlus OTAs does not check if the current version is lower than or equal to the version of the image being installed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper version checking in the `updater-script` allows for downgrades to older versions. The update transaction also occurs over non-TLS, which makes a Man-in-the-Middle attack feasible.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Downgrading to older versions allows exploitation of now-patched vulnerabilities, potentially granting access to user data.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attack by intercepting the non-TLS update transaction.
    - Physical attack by rebooting the phone into recovery and using `adb sideload` to push the OTA.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - MiTM attacker must be able to intercept network traffic during an update.
    - Physical attacker needs physical access to the phone and must disable "Secure Start-up" on OnePlus 3/3T.
