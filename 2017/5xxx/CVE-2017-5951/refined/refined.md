Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5951:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference exists in the `ref_stack_index()` function within Ghostscript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference, causing a segmentation fault when the function `ref_stack_index()` is called with a specific crafted input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) due to the application crashing. In the Gentoo advisory, it also mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly detailed in the bug report.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted PostScript file.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a specific command and input file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PostScript file or similar input to a vulnerable Ghostscript instance.
- The attacker could achieve this by either tricking a user into opening a malicious file or through a service that processes untrusted Postscript files.

**Additional Details:**

- The initial crash reported by the fuzzer was in the function `mem_get_bits_rectangle`, however, this was later found to be a consequence of the actual vulnerability within `ref_stack_index()`.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Ghostscript including 9.05, 9.06, and 9.20 (as reported by Debian users), requiring a patch to address this.
- The fix was applied by commit `bfa6b2ec`.
