Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the Starscream WebSocket library's implementation of SSL pinning. The library performed SSL certificate pinning *after* the initial WebSocket handshake was sent, rather than *before*. This means that the initial handshake, which could contain sensitive information, was vulnerable to interception via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SSL Pinning Bypass:** The primary weakness is the incorrect timing of the SSL pinning check. By performing the check after the initial handshake, the library effectively bypasses its intended security mechanism during this critical phase.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information sent within the WebSocket handshake (e.g., session tokens, cookies).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker can intercept the initial WebSocket handshake GET request.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive data that may be included in the handshake, such as session tokens or cookies.
*   **Potential Account/Session Takeover:** With access to session tokens or cookies, an attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to the target application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** The attack vector involves an attacker placing themselves between the client and the server during the WebSocket handshake.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the client and server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access, preferably on the same network as the client.
*   **MITM Positioning:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic, typically achieved by being on the same network or using techniques such as ARP spoofing.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Starscream versions before 2.0.4.
*   The fix implemented in version 2.0.4 involves checking the SSL certificates before any data is sent through the stream. If the check fails, the connection is terminated.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Lukas Futera and Giuliano Galea of Centralway Numbrs AG.
