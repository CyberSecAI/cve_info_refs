Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user identity during the serialization and deserialization of proxy chains in a clustered Apache NiFi environment. Specifically, the tokenization code and sanitization of user-provided input were insufficient.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Injection Vulnerability:** A crafted username could be injected during proxy chain serialization.
- **Improper Authentication:** By injecting a malicious username, an attacker could impersonate another user and gain their permissions on replicated requests sent to other nodes in the cluster.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-provided input was not properly sanitized during the serialization process of the proxy chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain the permissions of another user within the NiFi cluster.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data within the NiFi environment.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** With elevated permissions, an attacker could modify or delete data managed by NiFi.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Networked Cluster Environment:** The attack requires a clustered NiFi setup.
- **Replicated HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered during the replication of HTTP requests within the cluster.
- **Crafted Username:** An attacker must construct a malicious username during an initial request to a cluster node, which is then replicated to other nodes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a NiFi node within the cluster.
- **Knowledge of NiFi Cluster:** The attacker needs to know the architecture of the NiFi cluster to exploit the vulnerability
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious HTTP requests including a specific username structure to gain elevated privileges.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was addressed in NiFi versions 0.7.2 and 1.1.2.
- The fix involved modifying the tokenization code and implementing better sanitization of user-provided input during proxy chain serialization and deserialization.
- The vulnerability is related to NIFI-3487 Jira issue.
- The reported severity is Medium.
