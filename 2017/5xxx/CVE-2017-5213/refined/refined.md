      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "A self-XSS vulnerability was identified in the mail signature editor of Open-Xchange App Suite.",
      "root_cause": "The mail signature editor lacked sufficient client-side sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input sanitization",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially inject malicious client-side code into the user's mail signature, leading to self-XSS.",
       "attack_vector": "The attack vector would involve the user crafting a malicious payload and inserting it into their own email signature. This payload would then be executed when the user views their signature.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a legitimate user of the application with the ability to modify their own mail signature."
