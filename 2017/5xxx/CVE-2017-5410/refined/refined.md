  "CVE-2017-5410": {
    "description": "Memory corruption resulting in a potentially exploitable crash during garbage collection of JavaScript due errors in how incremental sweeping is managed for memory cleanup.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how `ObjectValueMap::findZoneEdges` adds a key's zone to its delegate's zone's `gcZoneGroupEdges` set. This occurs even for delegate zones that are not being marked. Because the `gcZoneGroupEdges` set is not cleared for these zones, it can hold zone pointers past the point where the zone is destroyed.",
     "weaknesses": [

        "Memory corruption" 
        ],
    "impact": "A potentially exploitable crash due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating JavaScript garbage collection in a way that involves incremental sweeping.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to trigger specific JavaScript garbage collection operations that lead to the vulnerable state. No specific details about code injection or remote code execution via web pages are provided; however,  it's implied a crafted web page would be required.  Requires ability to trigger garbage collection and memory corruption in a web browser.",
