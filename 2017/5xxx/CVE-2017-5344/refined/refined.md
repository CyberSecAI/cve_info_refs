Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-5344

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from string interpolation and direct SQL statement execution without proper sanitization of user input.
- Specifically, the application uses a whitelist and partial filtering of user input before interpolation, but this is bypassed using blind boolean SQL injection techniques.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind Boolean SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind boolean SQL injection in the `q` and `inode` parameters of the `/categoriesServlet` path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive information from the database used by dotCMS.
- **Potential Remote Shell:** In specific DBMS configurations (like MSSQL with xp_exec), it could lead to a remote shell. The impact severity depends on the DBMS configuration and type.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The `/categoriesServlet` is remotely accessible and does not require authentication.
- **URL Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered through manipulating the `q` and `inode` parameters in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the dotCMS application.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested with MySQL 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7.
- PostgreSQL is also vulnerable if the `standard_confirming_strings` setting is disabled (which is enabled by default).
- The exploit bypasses previous filtering mechanisms by using specific SQL injection techniques.
- The fix involved implementing prepared statements to sanitize user input, which was lacking in the vulnerable versions.
- The vulnerability was present in dotCMS since at least version 3.0

**Affected Versions:**
- dotCMS <= 3.3.2 (MySQL, MSSQL, H2, PostgreSQL)
- dotCMS 3.5 - 3.6.1 (MySQL, or PostgreSQL with standard_confirming_strings disabled)

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to dotCMS version 3.6.2 or higher.
- Restrict access to the `/categoriesServlet` to specific IP ranges, ideally the administrator's IP range.

**Additional Notes:**
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available at: `https://github.com/xdrr/webapp-exploits/tree/master/vendors/dotcms/2017.01.blind-sqli`
- The provided shell script `dotcms-dump.sh` is a practical example of exploiting this vulnerability to dump user information and password hashes.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ben Nott, with credit to Erlar Lang for inspiring the discovery.
