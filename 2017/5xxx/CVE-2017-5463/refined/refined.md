Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5463:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Firefox for Android handles URLs when launching in reader mode via an intent. Specifically, the browser does not strip the userinfo field (username/password) from the URL before displaying it in the address bar.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof the address bar in reader mode. By crafting a URL with a userinfo field, an attacker can display a misleading domain in the address bar while the actual content comes from a different source.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The browser fails to properly sanitize or strip the userinfo part of the URL when handling "about:reader?url=" intents, leading to the spoofing issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **User Deception:** Attackers can mislead users into believing they are on a legitimate site when, in fact, they are viewing content from a potentially malicious source.
*   **Phishing:** This spoofing can be used to facilitate phishing attacks where users might enter credentials or other sensitive information believing it's a trusted site.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Android Intents:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of Android intents to launch Firefox for Android in reader mode with a crafted URL.
*   **Malicious Applications:** A malicious application can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted intent to Firefox for Android to display spoofed content in reader mode.
*  **Malicious Ads:**  Malicious ads in otherwise OK apps can also trigger this intent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Send Intents:** The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted Android intent to the Firefox for Android application. This could be done via a malicious application installed on the user's device or by exploiting vulnerabilities in other apps that allow for launching intents.
*   **No Network Interception Needed:** The attack does not require the attacker to be in the middle of a network connection or perform any man-in-the-middle activities.
*   **User interaction (indirect):** The user needs to have the malicious app installed, or to interact with a malicious ad in another app.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Firefox for Android.
*   The issue was fixed by stripping the username/password after stripping the reader mode URL prefix.
*   The severity is rated as "moderate" due to the requirement of a malicious application or ad.
*   The fix is included in Firefox 53+, 54+, and 55+
*   There are also follow-up bugs about whitelisting of accepted schemes through intents (see Bug 1357377).
