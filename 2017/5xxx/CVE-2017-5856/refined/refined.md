Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-5856:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter emulation support in QEMU. Specifically, a memory leak occurs in the `megasas_handle_dcmd` routine while processing MegaRAID Firmware Interface (MFI) commands.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- Host memory leakage

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A privileged user inside a guest operating system can exploit this flaw to leak host memory.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is launched from within a guest operating system running on QEMU.
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the guest to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Privileged access within a guest operating system
- Ability to send crafted MegaRAID Firmware Interface (MFI) commands to the emulated device.

**Additional Notes**
- The issue is present in QEMU versions prior to 2.8.0-r1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.
- An upstream patch was made available
- This vulnerability is related to the QEMU's emulation of the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter.
