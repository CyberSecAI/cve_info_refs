Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-5442:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists due to incorrect management of object lifetimes during style changes while manipulating DOM elements. Specifically, the `GetRequiredInnerTextLineBreakCount` function might attempt to access a freed object as it is called during a style flush. This is because the function calls `ElementIsVisible` which may call `SetNeedStyleFlush` which triggers a style flush, possibly freeing the object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free, where memory is accessed after it has been freed. This occurs when a style flush occurs, freeing an object that is still being referenced.
- **Incorrect Object Lifetime Management:** The underlying weakness lies in the code not ensuring the objects used during style changes are kept alive during the flush/layout process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Potentially exploitable crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the application. However, because a use-after-free exists, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The code comments even point this out as something potentially exploitable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious web content:** The vulnerability can be triggered by specially crafted web content. An attacker can manipulate the DOM and trigger the style changes that lead to the use-after-free, resulting in a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- The test case provided in the bug report demonstrates a method to trigger this vulnerability using Javascript

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to inject arbitrary code on a page:** An attacker needs to be able to control a web page that is viewed by the victim in order to exploit this vulnerability.
-   The attacker would need to craft HTML and Javascript to trigger the specific DOM manipulation, style changes, and layout behavior to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of specific DOM properties and Javascript functions:** The attacker would need to know which Javascript and HTML elements trigger style recalculations in specific ways that lead to this vulnerability being exposed.

The content also reveals that this vulnerability was fixed in Firefox versions 53, ESR 45.9, ESR 52.1 and Thunderbird 52.1.

Additionally, the fix involved holding a strong reference to the relevant object during style changes/flushing, to prevent its premature deallocation.
