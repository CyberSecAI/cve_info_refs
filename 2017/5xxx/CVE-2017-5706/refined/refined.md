  "CVE-2017-5706": {
    "Description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Intel chipsets. IntelÂ® Management Engine (ME) firmware versions 11.0/11.5/11.6/11.7/11.10/11.20, IntelÂ® Server Platform Services (SPS) firmware version 4.0, and IntelÂ® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) firmware version 3.0 are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a platform, IntelÂ® ME features, and 3rd party secrets protected by the ME, SPS, or TXE. No NetApp products ship affected versions of the firmware. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impersonate the ME/SPS/TXE, thereby impacting local security feature attestation validity, load and execute arbitrary code outside the visibility of the user and operating system, or cause a system crash or system instability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple buffer overflows in Intel ME firmware.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflows leading to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could impersonate the ME/SPS/TXE, impact local security feature attestation, load and execute arbitrary code outside of user and OS visibility, or cause a system crash/instability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access with high privileges."
