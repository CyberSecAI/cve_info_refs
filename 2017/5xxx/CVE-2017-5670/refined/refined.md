Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5670:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary issue is that Riverbed products were using the `rm` command to delete the secure vault (an encrypted storage area) instead of using a secure deletion method like `shred` or `srm`. This left the data recoverable from the raw disk blocks after the deletion.
*   Additionally, the encryption key for the secure vault was derived from a hardcoded string concatenated with the device's serial number, which is considered weak and easily obtainable.
*   The lack of a bootloader password allowed for easy booting into single-user mode.
*   Shell access was not properly restricted in single-user mode

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Data Deletion:** The use of `rm` instead of secure deletion tools.
2.  **Weak Cryptographic Key Generation:** The encryption key for the secure vault was not sufficiently random or protected.
3.  **Missing Bootloader Security:** No bootloader password was required, allowing attackers to modify the boot process easily.
4. **Insecure single-user mode**: The system did not properly restrict access in single-user mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with physical access could extract sensitive information such as SSL private keys, the RiOS data store encryption key, and user credentials from the secure vault.
*   The weak encryption key made it possible to decrypt the vault offline, without even needing to gain root access on the appliance itself.
*   Gaining root access via single-user mode allowed an attacker to potentially modify the system to gain persistent access, even if the secure vault is properly configured.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the Riverbed appliance.
*   **Boot Manipulation:** The attacker reboots the appliance and manipulates the boot process to gain access to the system's shell via single-user mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Presence:** The attacker must have physical access to the device.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to boot a Linux system into single-user mode and how to mount file systems.
*   **Terminal Access:** Access to a serial console (RS232) is necessary to interact with the boot process and obtain a shell.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Sydream Labs, who also provided a proof-of-concept for exploiting it.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Riverbed product lines, including SteelHead and SteelFusion.
*   Riverbed initially claimed that the weak encryption was not a vulnerability, but eventually released a security advisory (S30065) acknowledging the issue.
*   Riverbed's proposed mitigation strategies involve restricting physical access, setting boot loader and BIOS passwords, changing the secure vault password, and using secure deletion procedures when decommissioning the devices. They also recommend keeping software up-to-date.
*   A related CVE-2017-7307 is mentioned, which allows an attacker to obtain root privileges in single-user mode if shell access is not restricted.
