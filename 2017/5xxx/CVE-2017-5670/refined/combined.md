# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

###### Issue

**CVE-2017-5670, CVE-2017-7305, CVE-2017-7306, CVE-2017-7307** have been posted for the Secure Vault feature by an independent third-party.  The Secure Vault is an AES 256-bit encrypted area of disk used on several Riverbed products to hold sensitive information from the device’s configuration. This can include, for example, SSL private keys for use with SSL optimization, the RiOS data store encryption key, and replication or delegate user configuration details.

The 3rd party was able to modify the system by having physical access to the appliance, and rebooting the appliance into [single-user mode](https://supportkb.riverbed.com/support/index?page=content&id=S14172). They were also able to use other aspects of the default configuration settings to exploit the system and extract information from the vault. This knowledge base article addresses each of the four CVEs disclosed as a result of the 3rd party findings.

For additional information on how to subscribe, see [S22384](https://supportkb.riverbed.com/support/index?page=content&id=S22384).

### **CVE-2017-5670 Issue**

The Riverbed products and versions listed below delete the secure vault with the rm program (not shred or srm), which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading raw disk blocks.

SteelHead products

| **Product** | Affected Versions | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SteelCentral Controller for SteelHead** | All current versions | See Solution section below for mitigation |
| **SteelCentral Controller for SteelHead Mobile** | All current versions | See Solution section below for mitigation |

###### Solution

Deploying your device following the best practices outlined below, and in our documentation, will ensure proper protection of the Secure Vault contents.

The Securing SteelHeads section of the Deployment Guide provides additional information - [this is a direct link to the 9.5 documentation](https://support.riverbed.com/bin/support/static/17qudtqont75l258qrbn4maj75/html/1mk0rjev5snblam40lgbg0mrgp/sh_9.5_dg_html/index.html#page/sh_9.5_dg%2Fradius_tacacs.html%23ww225116), the most current at the time of publication.  This information applies to all vulnerable products described in this KB.

### **CVE-2017-5670 Solution**

**Restrict Physical Access**

Treat the Riverbed device in the same manner as other infrastructure devices handling sensitive data. Restrict physical access to only authorized users.  By acquiring physical access to a device, an attacker through single user mode can gain control, including lost password recovery procedures. Even without breaking into the software, it is possible to gain access to the contents of disks by gaining access to the device itself. You should treat the device as comparable in value to the servers or clients that hold sensitive data.

**Decommissioning**

Take proper steps when decommissioning your device, including the erasing of the Secure Vault and hard disk data in the steps outlined here: [S13237](https://supportkb.riverbed.com/support/index?page=content&id=S13237)

### **CVE-2017-7305 Solution**

If you are unable to restrict physical access or would like to further strengthen the protection around the encrypted data in the Secure Vault, Riverbed recommends implementing the following best practices; additional information is available in Riverbed documentation.

**Use a Boot Loader Password**

Setting a boot loader password prevents anyone with physical access to the device from modifying the boot sequence, including loading single-user mode for password recovery.

To configure a boot loader password:

Steelhead (config) # **boot bootloader password <password>**

Steelhead (config) # **write memory**

Steelhead (config) # **reload**

**Use a BIOS Password**

Enable a BIOS password for pre-boot protection against unauthorized system booting, and loading single-user mode for password recovery.

To configure a password:

* Connect a null modem cable to a SteelHead.
* Open up a terminal on your host to the SteelHead.
* Power up the SteelHead.
* Press F4 to enter BIOS.
* Navigate to the Security tab.
* Specify a supervisor password.
* Make sure that the user password option is set to OFF.
* Save your configuration and continue to boot the SteelHead.

### **CVE-2017-7306 Solution**

**Restrict Physical Access**

Treat the Riverbed device in the same manner as other infrastructure devices handling sensitive data. Restrict physical access to only authorized users. By acquiring physical access to a device, an attacker through single user mode can gain control, including lost password recovery procedures. Even without breaking into the software, it is possible to gain access to the contents of disks by gaining access to the device itself. You should treat the device as comparable in value to the servers or clients that hold sensitive data. Decommissioning Take proper steps when decommissioning your device, including the erasing of the Secure Vault and hard disk data in the steps outlined here: S13237 If you are unable to restrict physical access or would like to further strengthen the protection around the encrypted data in the Secure Vault, Riverbed recommends implementing the following best practices; additional information is available in Riverbed documentation.

**Change the Secure Vault Password**

The key used for encrypting the Secure Vault data can be changed to a value only known by the device administrator.  This ensures the Secure Vault is only unlocked when an authorized user has access to the device.  To change the Secure Vault password:

Steelhead (config) # **secure-vault new-password <password>**

Steelhead (config) # **write memory**

**Note**:

Changing the key requires it to be entered by the user on every start-up of the device.  Functionality dependent on the Secure Vault cannot operate until it is unlocked.  Unlocking the secure vault:

Steelhead (config) # **secure-vault unlock <password>**

Devices that are managed by the SteelCentral Controller for SteelHead (SCC) can have their Secure Vault automatically unlocked upon connection to the SCC after reboot. This allows a key not known to RiOS to be used while also still allowing automatic unlock at boot.

### **CVE-2017-7307 Solution**

If you are unable to restrict physical access or would like to further strengthen the protection around the encrypted data in the Secure Vault, Riverbed recommends upgrading to a supported version of Riverbed RiOS which includes a challenge/response function to protect against this unauthorized access; additional information is available in Riverbed documentation.

# Nmap Network Scanning

[![Cover of Nmap Network Scanning](https://nmap.org/book/cover/nns-whole-cover-326x200.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20)

*Nmap Network Scanning* is
the official guide to the [Nmap Security Scanner](https://nmap.org/),
a free and open source utility used by millions of people for
network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From
explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing
low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits
all levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference
guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the
book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve
real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on
the wire.

Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks
with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided
for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Nmap's original author, Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon, wrote
this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning
during more than a decade of Nmap development. It was briefly the #1
selling computer book on Amazon
([screenshot](https://nmap.org/book/img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).
The book is in English, though [several translations](#translations) are in the works.

Key facts: The ISBN is 978-0-9799587-1-7 (ISBN-10 is 0-9799587-1-7)
and suggested retail prices are $49.95 in the U.S., £34.95 in
the U.K., and €39.95 in Europe. Like most books, it costs less
online (as little as $32.97 - see [purchasing
options](#purchase)). It is 468 pages long. The official release date was
January 1, 2009, though Amazon managed to beat that by a couple weeks.

## Updates

Several people asked whether Nmap Network Scanning
is still up to date, particularly after the release of [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/). The good news is that virtually all of the
content remains accurate. But we have added some new features and
NSE scripts which aren't yet documented in NNS.

For a comprehensive and completely current view of Nmap, I
recommend reading Nmap Network Scanning first, then read all the
changelog entries we've produced since the book was finished. The
book is completely up-to-date with Nmap 4.76. So after (or before)
you're done reading Nmap Network Scanning, visit
the [Nmap changelog](https://nmap.org/changelog.html) and search
in the file for “Nmap 4.76”. Read each item upward from there
(scrolling backward) until you get to the top.
## Translations

We would love to make the Nmap book more accessible by working with foreign publishers who will translate and distribute it in their markets. If you are such a publisher or know a good one to suggest, please let me know. Here are the current or in-progress translations:

**December 19, 2008:** The book is [back in stock on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) after a 10 day dry spell!

**December 10, 2008:** Amazon has now indexed this book as part of
their “Search Inside” program. While Amazon intends this
as a marketing tool for prospective buyers, it can be even more useful
for folks who already own the book. While we're proud of our index,
Search Inside can help find more obscure terms or combinations of them. You can try this out by visiting
the [Amazon
NNS page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20), scrolling down to the Search Inside box, and typing in a
term such as Trinity or Microsoft.

**December 9, 2008:** Sales were so high that Amazon ran out of stock in the US, UK, and Germany. They say it may take a week or more to ship. Amazon still offers a great price, but for those who can't wait, I've added a [purchasing options](#purchase) section. It includes vendor such as A1Books and Barnes & Noble with NNS in stock now.

**December 9, 2008:** Nmap Network Scanning sales surge further to become #1 on [Amazon's computer book best seller list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20)! Since we can't keep that rank forever, I took a [screenshot](img/nns-top-seller-471x512.png) ([larger version](img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).

**December 8, 2008:**
An [excellent
Slashdot review](http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/12/08/1443223.shtml) causes NNS to rocket into [Amazon's top 10 computer books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20).

**December 6, 2008:** Amazon has [fixed the price](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) so it is now $33.71 rather than $49.95. NNS is **in stock and shipping**!

**December 2, 2008:** The book has [an initial page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20). You can pre-order it now, but Amazon is showing a pre-order price of $49.95. I expect the price to be about $33 when Amazon starts shipping it within a week or two. Amazon will probably refund the difference per their "Pre-order price guarantee", but it might be safer to wait. Book seller BOOKSPLUSMORESTUFF claims to have the book "in stock" on Amazon for $53.94 including shipping. That may or may not be true.

**November 14, 2008:** The book is finished and submitted to the
printer! The official release date is January 1, 2009, though our
goal is to make it available on Amazon and other retailers by
mid-December. To be notified upon publication, join the
low-traffic [nmap-hackers
announcement mailing list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce).

**September 15, 2008:** The Black Hat/Defcon pre-release was a huge
success! All of the Defcon copies were snapped up as soon as the
vendor room opened, and the Black Hat copies also sold out in the
first morning of the conference. Thanks to Bill Pollock of No Starch
Press and Dave Hemsath of BreakPoint Books for handling sales. My
conference presentation video and audio have
been [posted
online](http://insecure.org/presentations/) just in time for
the [Nmap
4.75 release](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html) which includes the new features discussed in that
presentation.

**July 25, 2008**: Defcon Pre-Release announced! We have decided to
launch the book with a limited pre-release version at Defcon 16.

**July 1, 2008**: After years of work, Nmap Network Scanning is nearing completion. You can browse the [current table of contents](toc.pdf) to see what is coming. We recently conducted a test-printing of some prepublication copies:

# CVE-2017-5670 : Riverbed RiOS insecure cryptographic storage

# Riverbed RiOS insecure cryptographic storage (CVE-2017-5670)

## Description

Riverbed Steelhead hardware appliances are used to optimize and
accelerate network traffic.
There can be implemented as TLS endpoints, so they have a secure vault
aimed to store private TLS certificates for servers.
The secure vault has FIPS mode support.

## Improper encryption implementation

The secure vault used on the Steelhead appliance (and potentially other
that we could not test) is not efficient in its default form, because of
the lack of boot loader security.

**Threat**

An adversary can boot an appliance and recover all private keys of the
server certificates that are configured on it. It may happen in various
situation (subcontractors, hardware decommissioning, etc.).

**Expectation**

With proper encryption (FDE) and sanitization procedures, certificates
should be unrecoverable, as quoted from the documentation:

```
> ```
> Since the information is only in memory, when an appliance is rebooted
>
> ```

```
or powered off, the information is no longer available".

**CVE ID**: CVE-2017-5670

**Access Vector**: local

**Security Risk**: medium

**Vulnerability**: CWE-310, CWE-321

**CVSS Base Score**: 7.1

**CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L

### Defeating system encryption with anonymous console access

We followed the steps below to take over the appliance and recover
private keys from the file system, with zero knowledge of the appliance
and its configuration :

**1/** Connect to the appliance in RS232.

**2/** Turn on the appliance and edit the Grub line to boot in `single` mode

**3/** Proceed with the boot to get the root shell. But at this stage,
vault decryption has not happened yet.

**4/** Reset the *admin* password, which can be achieved with the
`/sbin/resetpw.sh` script.

**5/** Modify the firmware to replace `/opt/tms/bin/cli` with `bash` :

```
# mount / -o remount, rw
# cd /opt/tms/bin/
# mv cli cli.bask
# cp /bin/bash cli
# reboot
```

**5/** Reboot to now get a full admin access with a `bash` shell.

**6/** Use the `mount` command to confirm that decryption has happened:

```
# mount
encfs on /var/opt/rbt/decrypted type fuse.encfs
(rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0)
# ls /var/opt/rbt/decrypted
available framework notes ssl tmp
```

**7/** Now insert an USB key and retrieve the whole vault. Note that
non-exportable certificates can be extracted without any issue (from
`./decrypted/server_certs/names/NOExportableCA/`).
The exportation is only based on a local file that acts as a flag:

```
# cat /var/opt/rbt/decrypted/server_certs/names/NOExportableCA/exportable
false
```

**8/** Note that encryption is made by the `/sbin/secure_vault.sh`
script, which makes EncFS encryption based on fixed and hard-coded keys:

```
[...]
MAGIC_STRING='This ********* motorcycle'
[...]
PASSWORD="${MAGIC_STRING}_{SERIAL_NUM}
[...]
```

So the passphrase is basically a concatenation of a constant magic
string and the appliance serial number, two pieces of information that
an attacker can easily retrieve.

```
> ```
> With this knowledge, it is trivial to reproduce the decryption on any
>
> ```

```
Linux computer with EncFS. Thus, it is actually not necessary anymore to
root the appliance to decrypt data, the disk content could be copied
offline.

Several weaknesses lead to the certificate exposure:

- The boot loading chain is not password protected (starting with Grub)
and there is no integrity control, so it is trivial to "root" the appliance.
- File-system level encryption is inefficient for protecting local
storage, especially when the system lacks of integrity protection : the
disk can be accessed and the data can be retrieved while it is decrypted.
- A fixed and hard-coded value is used by the system as an encryption
key. It even makes offline decryption easy.
- Do not claim to encrypt with PBKDF-2 in the documentation. The user
password is used with no derivation.

### A look at the user password mode

In an improved vault encryption mode, the appliance allows the user to
encrypt with its own key.
The documentation advertises that the key is based on PBKDF-2, so we
expect that the encryption to be a hash.

We set this mode and tracked system calls while unlocking a certificate
in the Web interface :

```
# strace -e write -o /tmp/out /opt/tms/bin/mgmtd & 1 > /dev/null 2>&1
[...]
write(19, "Pass123_EC6R*****0\n", 22) = 22
[...]
```

So we found the password that we set for the vault, appended with the
appliance serial number. With this information, we succeeded in
decrypting the vault offline, from another Linux box.

Riverbed advertises that the use of PBKDF-2 makes the password stronger
to prevent brute force attacks (as it is used in EncFS).
However, a poorly chosen pass phrase (in the absence of password policy
enforcement) and a physically readable salt (the serial number on the
appliance) would yet defeat the benefits of EncFS encryption.

## Insecure secure vault deletion

Two scripts are used at different times to delete the secure vault:
`/sbin/secure_vault_clear.sh` and `/sbin/scrub.sh`.

They simply use the `rm` system command to delete the files, as follows:

```
[...]
umount /var/opt/rbt/decrypted
rm -rf /var/opt/rbt/decrypted
rm -rf /var/opt/rbt/encrypted
rm -f /var/opt/rbt/ssl
[...]
```

A better practice would be to use `shred` or `srm` utilities to wipe
files securely.

## Affected versions

RiOS versions prior to 9.0.1 regarding the single boot mode.

Potentially all version regarding secure vault weak encryption and wiping.

### Solution

Sysdream considers that the encryption scheme needs a complete
re-factoring in relevance with the secrets it protects. We believe that
full disk encryption should be implemented, with better boot loader
security features. Default security and clarifications should be
mandatory for this kind of appliance.

As of now, Riverbed advises:

```
> ```
> 1) Ensure physical access is protected
> 2) Keep your software up-to-date
> 3) Set a bootloader password
> 4) Set a BIOS password
> 5) Change the default secure-vault password
> 6) Take proper steps when decommissioning including erasing hard-disk data
>
> ```

```

We could not verify that all these items can be implemented (for
instance, on our model and RiOS version, no setting allowed to set a
Grub and BIOS password, and the user guide did not mention anything).
So, please refer to your documentation (deployment guide) or support to
check how you can implement these security settings.

## Timeline (dd/mm/yyyy)

* 7/12/2016 Initial discovery
* 11/12/2016    First e-mail contact
* 17/12/2016    Sent all details to Riverbed contact
* 26/01/2017    After several requests to the support, got contact with
the security team. Riverbed position is that customers should put proper
physical protections in place in any case. Also, version 9.0.1 removed
single mode boot.
