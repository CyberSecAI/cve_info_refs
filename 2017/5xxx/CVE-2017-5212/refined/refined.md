Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5212:

**Verification:**

The provided text mentions CVE-2017-5212, indicating relevance to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from missing permission checks when accessing attachments of tasks. Specifically, when a user tries to access an attachment of a task, the system did not verify if the underlying task was accessible in the parent folder.

*   **Weakness:** Insufficient authorization checks. The system allowed access to task attachments without properly verifying if the user had the necessary permissions to access the parent task.

*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to task attachments. An attacker could potentially view or modify task attachments they shouldn't have access to, if they could somehow get access to the file identifiers of such attachments.

*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector would involve a user attempting to access a task attachment via the API or a similar means of accessing attachments, without proper authorization of the parent folder containing the task.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to have a valid user account. They would need to have some way of knowing or guessing the identifiers of the attachments of tasks in folders they don't have explicit permissions for, but are potentially visible for other users within a context they belong to.
