### Fixed Bugs

#### [555692](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=555692) Mobile UI changes layout in jslob

Jslob saves also stores fixed settings that are applied for smartphones only.This has been fixed by not saving 'layout', 'showContactPictures' and 'showCheckboxes' for mobile devices.

#### [55788](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55788) Save in drive for webmail user not usable

General problem that might occur if an action gets chained.Once an undefined list element was present the check always returned true now("draw it").

#### [55776](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55776) Spamexperts not working with https

The 'starts with' and 'ends with' simplified rules got mixed up.Properly parse starts- and ends with match types to solve this issue.

Sortorder was adjusted. Note: Selecting a specific sort field (other than "date") when mails are grouped by conversations might still yield "strange" results since a conversation's mails are statically sorted by "date" and only the top mail of each conversations is considered for sorting the conversation groups. Having a flagged mail in the midst of a conversation does not sort that mail to the top since only conversation's newest mail is considered.

Added missing translation.

#### [55254](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55254) Rename / delete folders in OX Drive not possible

#### [55200](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55200) Capabilities checks performed against "mailfilter" instead of "mailfilter v2"

Even though the `mailfilter.v2` API is the one being used, capability checks were done against the legacy to `mailfilter` API. This has been solved by setting capability check to `mailfilter v2`.

#### [54468](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54468) Status of a multi-file incorrect

If a file uplaod was running and a second file upload is started, the upload time were not calculated new. Fixed time estimation as increased collection size was not taken into account during calculation.

#### [55042](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55042) Inconsistency when selecting an empty folder in the Mail tab

The text "Empty" is shown initially when selecting a empty mail folder but not when the user did tap on other folders and then returns back. Second visit calls busy twice that breaks the "visibile-invisible-chain". This has been fixed by using a robust implementation that utilizes busy and idle.

#### [54879](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54879) Quotes in email local part not allowed

Possible quotes (") in local part of an E-Mail address were handled as special characters. Now orderly handle quotes in local part of an E-Mail address to solve this issue.

#### [54232](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54232) File names are case sensitive

#### [52719](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52719) Prefetched documents are not used by the viewer

In some cases like PDF source content or previously rendered files, a ManagedFile was returned although the request contained an `async` flag. This has been solved by ignorring ManagedFiles at all whenever `async` flag is set at request and return a JSON Object with element `{"async":true}` in such cases.

### Fixed Bugs

#### [54790](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54790) Getting quota does not work anymore

When requesting quota information for non-existing file storage accounts a runtime exception was thrown instead of properly handling the case. This has now been corrected.

#### [54774](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54774) Sending user feedback fails with empty SMTP auth values

When sending user feedback as CSV file via mail, empty SMTP authentication configuration settings would prevent sending the mail. We added a potential solution for this, however did not have nec- essary information to reproduce the original problem. Therefor this fix has to be validated by the requesting customer.

#### [54702](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54702) Rename folder pop-up not closing

The dialog to rename a folder in App Suite would not close under very special conditions. This has been researched and a potential workaround got applied. The effectiveness of this solutions needs to be validated for the environment in question.

#### [54701](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54701) Unable to copy raw image content to mail compose with IE11

When copying raw image content from apps like MS Paint to mail compose, rather than just adding that image via drag&drop or the provided composer options, its content did not get pasted when using IE11. This has been corrected for this particular case, however note that copy&paste is implemented very inconsistently across browsers and operating systems, other cases will potentially not work as expected since the browser does not provide necessary information to web applications.

#### [54673](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54673) Same timestamp shown for drafts in multiple composers

When composing multiple mails at the same time, the date/time information when the mail has been saved as draft was added to all open composer windows and did overwrite the actual date. This has been solved so that each composer window shows the correct saving date.

#### [54580](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54580) Issues with parsing plain-text links in mail

Certain E-Mails did contain combinations of text that led to incorrect hyperlink detection. This got solved by parsing links at plain-text mails less greedy.

#### [54534](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54534) Socket monitoring support

To allow debugging potential network and remote service issues more efficiently, we added sup- port to log connection status and usage metrics for each socket that gets opened to an external system (e.g. Database, IMAP). See Change SCR-24 for more information.

#### [54453](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54453) Account help page missing

A particular help page for external accounts was incorrectly linked, this has been corrected.

#### [54437](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54437) Contact collector not working

Collecting contact information while reading mail was not working when combining specific mail handling (seen/unseen) in combination with contact collection. This has been solved.

#### [52637](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52637) Unable to print encrypted mails

Encrypted mails could not be printed after decrypting. This has been fixed.

#### [51194](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51194) Ability to disable adding attachments to PIM apps via configuration

A new frontend-side configuration option has been added to disable the "add attachment" area when creating or editing PIM objects. Note that this is purely cosmetic and does not affect other clients than OX App Suite. See Change #4301 for more information.

Tried to create previews for documents for local files. This has been solved by not trying to create previews for documents for local files.

#### [54593](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54593) No error message if import limit is reached

No warning given in case number of imported items were truncated. This has been fixed by adding warning if number of imported objects were truncated.

#### [54529](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54529) Drive mail drive attachment counting filesize against upload limit

Any mail attachment appended to the new message has been checked against upload quota limitation. Only consider uploaded file (mail attachments) when checking upload quota limitation to solve this issue.

CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

### Fixed Bugs

#### [54532](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54532) Confusing error message "Folder INBOX has been closed on mail server"

Confusing displayed error message. Solution: Rephrased error messages dealing about connectivity issues to mail server to have a more user-friendly information. Moreover added the "Please try again later." suffix to hint to a possibly temporary nature of the issue.

#### [54454](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54454) Multiple contact selection works only on 2nd try

No previous selection when there actually was an item selected. This has been solved by using the correct selection.

#### [54377](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54377) Generating missing MD5 sums on filestore Objects causes high read load

There might be situations where the metadata for stored infostore documents does not indicate the referenced files MD5 checksum. This may be the case for files that were stored more than 4 years ago, or for files that have been uploaded in chunks, e.g. during a migration. When synchronizing via OX Drive, the missing checksums for those files are calculated on demand, which requires the files to be retrieved from the underlying storage. When having many or very large files where the checksum needs to be calculated for, this may lead to an increased read load which may impact other processes and systems in the installation. This has been fixed by providing functionality to calculate missing file checksums on demand.

#### [54349](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54349) Edge crashes on large attachments

Too much memory and CPU usage by canvas resize. Integrate canvas resize into our lazyload mechanism so not every picture is processed simultaniously to solve this issue.

#### [54348](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54348) Attachment filename wrong when forward email

Building the forwarded mail calling setHeader erased the header information about file name. This has been solved by calling `setHeader` first and set the file name header afterwards.

#### [54311](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54311) Unable to send mail with onboard external account as sender

A SMTP server which responds with non standards-compliant multi-line greeting on socket connect messed up parsing of serverâs capabilities. This has been solved by dealing with multi-line greetings from SMTP server.

#### [54262](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54262) No timeout message if loading modules fails

No error message on require timeout. This has been fixed by adding timeout message and reload option with longer timeout (30 seconds).

#### [54177](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54177) Creating folders or renaming folders to prefix A- or B- does not show

The folder title gets not re-rendered after a title change. Now after a title change also the folder title gets re-rendered.

#### [53965](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53965) Incorrect Japanese translation for "Unread" which appears in the "Sort by" menu

Adjusted the translation to solve this.

#### [53964](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53964) Incorrect translation for "Unread messages" in Japanese translation

Adjusted the translation to solve this.

#### [53963](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53963) Filter rule description text in the Folder picker with Language: Japanese

Adjusted the translation to solve this.

#### [53962](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53962) Japanese translation issues in Address Picker

Adjusted one translation and added a new translation to the Address Picker.

#### [53961](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53961) BCC is incorrectly translated as BBC in Japanese translation

Adjusted the translation to solve this.

#### [53454](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53454) A IMAP folder called "user" is visible

Leftover namespace folder remains in LIST/LSUB collection. This has been fixed by adding a special check that cares about dropping leftover namespace folders.

## Patch Release 4233 (2017-06-26)

### Shipped Components and Versions

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.4-rev5
* Open-Xchange AppSuite frontend 7.8.4-rev5
* Open-Xchange documentconverter 7.8.4-rev4

### Fixed Bugs

#### [54315](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54315) Incompatibility with SIEVE rules

When running OX App Suite 7.8.3 and 7.8.4 against a shared mail environment, SIEVE filter rules could unintentionally affect each other, for example auto-forward and vacation notice. This got fixed by retaining commented script content which is unknown to the 7.8.4 implementation.

#### [54181](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54181) Config-cascade inconsistency for value pairs

Certain value pairs where not correctly distributed by the config cascade mechanism, especially those related to services that use oAuth for authentication. We solved this by making those properties config-cascade aware.

#### [54136](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54136) Incorrect permission restriction when moving folders in Drive

When moving/copying a folder from a external storage service to folder of the primary OX Drive storage service, a permission related error was thrown. This got solved by properly setting administrator privileges to the creator of a OX Drive folder while copying/moving in folders from external services.

#### [54133](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54133) Sharing dialog stuck when sharing locked file

When attempting to share a file which is locked, the sharing dialog did not close when canceling the operation. This got solved by handling potential errors related to locks when trying to share a file.

#### [54069](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54069) Fuzzy fallback for unsupported languages

In certain cases the frontend language did fall back to german instead of english. This got fixed by setting a explicit fallback to en\_US if the browser provides a unsupported language and no previously set OX language cookie.

#### [54067](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54067) Outdated "unsupported browsers" message

OX App Suite UI did display incorrect recommendations for mobile browsers when using such as a desktop browser. This has been solved and we're now showing recommendations for mobile browsers only when using a mobile device.

#### [54042](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54042) Unable to update dates with Japanese locale

When defining start/end dates at the calendar on mobile browsers, the supplied data did not get taken over to the appointment. This was caused by incompatibility of a date/time format library with specific languages and has been fixed by making sure the same date/time format is used at all related components.

#### [54041](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54041) Missing schema information for database timeout errors

In case a database connection reported a communication failure or timeout, the specific database schema was not part of the exception. This has now been added to allow simple debugging of affected database clusters.

#### [54034](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54034) Missing recipient when removing and modifying recipients

In cases where the original recipients (To, Cc) of a mail got removed during compose and re-added later, the resulting mail was sent without recipient information. This got fixed by properly handling events related to tokens that display participants.

#### [53980](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53980) High CPU load caused by documentconverter

Changes to documentconverter led to higher than usual base CPU load. This impact got reduced by lowering a queue polling time to a value which offers a good compromise between queue responsiveness and "idle" CPU load.

#### [53958](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53958) More debug background for exceptions related to closed IMAP folders

In case a IMAP backend did close a connection due to technical issues or timeouts, the resulting stack-trace at OX App Suite middleware was rather generic. This has been improved in a way that we now show the related IMAP command to allow better debugging. This issue has to be validated in production environments that show such unexpected behavior.

#### [53923](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53923) Quick reply disappears after the first reply

When using "quick reply" to answer a mail, this option will disappear. We changed the behavior in a way that the option stays available after using it.

#### [53916](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53916) Adding local files opens camera App on iOS

When using OX App Suite UI with Safari on iOS, the action to add a local attachment resulted in immediate launch of the camera App. We now trigger a selection menu which offers to either use the camera or access existing photos on the device.

#### [53913](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53913) Vacation notices could not be activated for aliases

When setting a vacation notice, it was not possible to define a alias address for the notice instead of the primary address. This got fixed by more consistent checks for mail aliases.

#### [53688](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53688) Contacts with Katakana "yomi" fields were sorted as "other"

When using Japanese language settings and subsequently "yomi" contact fields, those contacts were sorted incorrectly as "other", which got solved.

#### [53671](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53671) Specific mails produced empty printouts

When printing specific mails that define CSS, the created print version did not show substantial content. This got fixed by dropping certain CSS elements from our whitelist that could lead to broken layouts. See Change #4204.

#### [53649](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53649) Folder IDs were shown in PIM objects attachment details

For PIM objects with attachments we did show the hyperlinks pointing to OX Drive instead of the corresponding App. To avoid confusion we did visually remove those links as they provide almost no functionality.

#### [53474](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53474) Duplicate recipients when sending mail

When sending a mail to all appointment participants the resulting mail compose did contain duplicates of the expected recipients. This got solved by detecting and removing the currently logged in user from that list.

#### [53437](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53437) Inconsistency for thumbnails and image preview

Certain file formats (tiff, psd, pbm) were shown as thumbnail preview while not being supported in image preview. To ensure consistency we added support for tiff and psd files to image preview.

#### [53313](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53313) Unable to edit name used for mail on mobile

When using OX App Suite UI on a mobile browser, updates to a E-Mail addresses "personal part" at mail compose were not reflected to the selected mail address. This got solved by updating the corresponding element after the change has happened.

#### [53900](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53900) 1st (out of two) Google Mail Account does not work after adding 2nd (out of two) Google Calender Abo

When updating an OAuth account (applying a new name), the enabled scopes was accidentally reseted.This has been solved by not touching OAuth account's enabled scopes when updating its name.

#### [53795](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53795) POP3 External account: messages retrieved are duplicated

Certain POP3 server's do not obey to advertise UIDLs with at max. 70 characters.This has been fixed by extending the "uidl" column in "pop3\_storage\_ids" and "pop3\_storage\_deleted" tables from 70 to 128 characters as some POP3 server advertise bigger UIDL values. An Updatetask will be triggered with this fix.

#### [53690](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53690) Fields considered for sorting / categorizing contacts inconsistent

A contact's (yomi-) firstname was not taken into account during sort name generation in case no (yomi-) lastname was set.This has been solved by using combination of (yomi-) last- and firstname per default as sort name.

#### [53689](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53689) Yomi fields not available / visible with non-Japanese language setting

Missing feature for other languages.Added new setting and feature to make yomi fields with other languages.

#### [53688](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53688) Contacts with Katakana "yomi" fields are sorted and categorized as "other"

Only hiragana in sorting table.Extend table with katakana to solve the first part. When yomi was given with Half-width Katakana it is still not sorted correctly, this will be fixed with an upcomming patch.

#### [53340](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53340) Appointment status of participant not updated via EAS

The list of confirmations was not part of the USM sync-state.USM syncs now the list of confirmations from the backend to solve this issue.

#### [53233](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53233) No appropriate folder storage for tree identifier "0" and folder identifier "label"

Used dummy folder\_id 'label'.This has been fixed by using 'virtual/label' now to avoid that an invalid ID is used in server requests.

#### [50760](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50760) Tabnabbing using "form" tags

We now prevent form submit, open a new window manually, nulling window.opener, redirect the form to the new window and then manually submit the form. In addition we removed "form" and "input" elements from the HTML sanitizing white-list. Note that this will remove such kind of content in legitimate mails. CVE-2017-5211, credits to Zoczus.

#### [50748](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50748) SVG can be used to set cookies

### Fixed Bugs

#### [53674](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53674) Broken filenames for certain Japanese file attachments

The "name" and "filename" attributes of Content-Type were incorrectly parsed, which led to broken attachment file names when using certain encodings. This got solved.

#### [53457](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53457) Unread counter not updating correctly

When moving a mail to the "Trash" folder, in some cases the unread counter was incorrectly updated. This has been solved by making such "move" operations more robust for the counter.

#### [53456](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53456) Unable to parse certain broken mails

Mails with broken Content-Type headers at their MIME part could not always be rendered. We added some workarounds in order to attempt parsing and displaying such mails.

#### [53451](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53451) Errors when importing specific CSV

Some CSV data did trigger errors during import, caused by incorrect mappings for "Marital status" and "Employee ID" and the attempt to import read-only values like "Object ID". This got solved by adjusting the mapping and skip list.

#### [53434](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53434) Database timeouts when executing "logincounter" CLT

The "logincounter" CLT did use excessive and unoptimized queries when generating statistics. In combination with millions of data sets this could lead to database timeouts and subsequently unusable output. We enhanced that function to use chunk-wise querying and processing of such kind of data.

#### [53368](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53368) UI does not load but also not redirect to unsupported.html for MSIE 9.0

Latest code changes make IE9 unusable.Now sending MSIE 9 users to the unsupported HTML file.

#### [53282](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53282)

#### [53267](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53267) Folder inconsistencies when changing a users password

Parts of the folder representation is cached and in cases where the users password got changed without terminating its session this cache was outdated and led to problems with standard folders like "Sent". This got solved by looking up those folders via mail accounts API rather than using a cache.

#### [53249](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53249) Unable to remove POP3 accounts

In special cases where the corresponding IMAP folder of a POP3 account got manually deleted, there were issues removing the associated POP3 account. Other issues were related to the attempt of deleting the same account multiple times. Those got fixed.

#### [53216](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53216) Slow rendering when composing mails to many recipients

In case of more than 50 recipients for a mail, the mail compose dialog became a bit unresponsive. This was caused by unnecessary requests to contact images and got solved by allowing to asynchronously load such images as well as reducing the amount of requests.

#### [53158](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53158) Missing documentation for oAuth scope configuration

Configuration description about oAuth and related scopes got added at <https://documentation.open-xchange.com>.

#### [53139](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53139) Google oAuth subscriptions were not assigned

In some cases the assignment of a Google oAuth account did break, usually when adding multiple accounts. In such cases the reference was made to the default Google account rather than the account associated to a subscription. This got fixed and the correct account is referenced now.

#### [53127](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53127) DAV Links for Tasks (and maybe for others too) are displayed although they are not accessible at all

Missing check if task folder is private.Added missing check to solve this issue.

#### [53100](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53100) Mail is not being displayed, blocking other from being displayed in INBOX

This was due to missing recovery for an unsupported character-encoding.This has been solved by handling possible unsupported character-encoding.

#### [53095](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53095) Unable to use oAuth accounts after permission downgrade

If a scope for a oAuth account got defined (e.g. to access a external calendar) and the corresponding OX account got downgraded to lose access to calendar, accessing the oAuth account was not possible anymore. This got improved by handling unexpected absence of scope and corresponding Apps.

#### [53087](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53087) Second Google calendar subscription does not show calendar contents

The actual OAuth account associated with a subscription has not been considered, but always the default Google OAuth account was referenced.Solution: Consider the actual OAuth account that is associated with a subscription. Info: Popup Blocker may not be active.

#### [53023](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53023) Message with truncated subject

Subsequent base64-encoded strings are not combinable if individual values end with padding '=' character.This has been fixed by not combine padded base64-encoded values, but decode them separately.

#### [53008](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53008) HTML content is invalid and cannot be displayed

Weird start tag segments in real-world HTML messes-up HTML parser refusing to process the content any further.Solution: Better deal with malformed start tags in real-world HTML content.

#### [52959](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52959) Layout issue with sharing on mobile

When sharing a link on smartphone devices, the dialog was displayed in a way that the input field for recipients of the link was not shown. This has been solved by allowing to scroll that section into the viewport on small screens.

#### [52928](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52928) Attachment not shown

In email with attachments which have different cid and id it was not possible to show all attachments.Make sure attachments do not have a cid attribute when added to a collection to solve this issue.

#### [52798](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52798) Missing appointments in Outlook

In special cases, a list of deleted change exceptions for recurring appointments was provided by Outlook to USM, which led to an exception and subsequently incomplete sync. This got fixed by considering this case.

#### [52797](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52797) Autoconfiguration fails for hotmail/yahoo/live domains

Thunderbird's ISPDB for auto-configuration changed.Changed default value for property "com.openexchange.mail.autoconfig.ispdb" in file 'autoconfig.properties' from "<https://live.mozillamessaging.com/autoconfig/v1.1/>" to
"<https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/>".

#### [52764](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52764) Document conversion triggered without capability

Even though a users did not have the "document\_preview" capability assigned, calls to the Documentconverter API were made. This got solved by considering the users capability before executing such requests, for example when generating thumbnail previews for mail attachments.

#### [52756](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52756) Twitter can not be configured anymore;Case-sensitive look-up for an OAuth API: "Twitter" is not equal to "twitter"

Case-sensitive look-up for an OAuth API: "Twitter" is not equal to "twitter".Perform ignore-case look-up by OAuth API identifier to solve this issue.

#### [52751](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52751) Creating external accounts does not work anymore

Wrong detection if a mail account action was targeted for primary mail account.Reliably check specified account identifier to determine primary account to solve this problem.

#### [52730](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52730) Misleading indication that IMAP folder is shared

In case IMAP ACLs just for "see folder" are granted, the "this folder is shared" indicator was displayed. While technically correct this is misleading to users since no content is actually shared. The handling has been changed to avoid displaying the indicator for this kind of ACL.

#### [52729](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52729) Missing reload when clearing Trash manually

When removing all mails within the Trash folder manually (select all, delete) instead of using the explicit function, the folder list was not reloaded. This got fixed by triggering a reload in such cases.

#### [52727](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52727) UI/Browser blocked / stalled when dealing with huge amounts of appointments

To many operations in DOM-tree if having much appointments.This has been fixed by disabling some functionality for a large Number of appointments.

#### [52712](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52712) Twitter stream not shown after configuration

Missing event in Keychain API led to this issue.This has been fixed by adding an additional event, so portal plugins update correctly.

#### [52675](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52675) HTML mail not displayed at all

Some mails were not displayed because style tag does not get closed while sanitizing mail's HTML content.This has been fixed by orderly closing the style tag while sanitizing HTML content.

#### [52633](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52633) Drag & drop of a huge picture into a HTML-Mail will cause the JVM to OOM/ up until OS swapped

Configured image limitations were not tested when checking for validity of an uploaded image.This has been solved by testing for image limitations when checking for validity of an uploaded image.

#### [52607](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52607) Inconsistent naming of recurring appointment dialogs

When changing or editing a recurring appointment, different dialogs with different naming were displayed. This got unified and changed to shorter naming in favor of small screen devices.

#### [52606](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52606) Show hidden files setting does not work at all

Hidden files were not displayed because filter extensions for files were never called.Invoked filter extension point to post process file list to solve this issue.

#### [52534](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52534) Disableschema: SessiondService is used but not registered in the activator

Required SessionD service was not orderly tracked.This has been solved by properly tracking needed SessionD service.

#### [52530](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52530) POP3 access to external account is not logged by AuditLog

The tracked instance of AuditLogService was not orderly put into utilized service registry.This has been fixed by properly putting tracked service into service registry.

#### [52478](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52478) Duplicate registration of ObfuscatorService

Even though ObfuscatorService is implemented as a singleton, it got registered multiple times which led to error messages. Those did not affect functionality but led to higher log traffic than necessary. The problem got fixed by making sure ObfuscatorService gets registered just once.

#### [52470](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52470) Incorrect detection of users USM capabilities

In certain cases a users capabilities to use USM and related sync implementations got incorrectly detected. We solved that by sticking to the advertised module access permissions instead of dynamically resolving it.

#### [52435](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52435) running processes/instances after the open-xchange-documentconverter-server stop script on RHEL6

init script problems according to title / shutdown of ReaderEngine instances not reliable during DC server bundle shutdown, fixed init scripts, cleanup after migration for 7.8.2 / catching spurious exception during RE instance kill in Java bundle shut.

#### [52433](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52433) Incomplete parsing of "mailto" handler at mails

In cases where a regular HTTP/HTTPS resource contains the subtring "mailto" like
"[www.mailtool.invalid](http://www.mailtool.invalid)", that link was incorrectly detected as mailto: handler and mail compose got opened rather than the URL. This got solved by just looking for mailto: at the beginning of a URL.

#### [52391](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52391) Empty Page in UI settings section after update

JS error in yell function and only a empty settings page were displayed.Made yell function more robust, so Settings do not break anymore.

#### [52314](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52314) Unicode decoding fails for multi-line mail subjects

In case a E-Mail subject spans multiple lines where each consists of UTF-8 mail-safe base64 encoded characters, decoding partly failed and Unicode characters were displayed in a scrambled way. This has been solved by properly handling such split subjects and encoding each part independently.

#### [52280](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52280) Read timeout log entries when using folders that were already closed

Several log messages referred to a situation where access to a IMAP folder is attempted which got closed already. We added optimizations to lower the probability of such cases and handle them correctly instead of throwing an error.

#### [52277](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52277) Wrong log level for concurrent updates to last-login

In case two threads update a users "last login" information, a log message of level "ERROR" was logged. Since this is rather a temporary issue and can't be solved in retrospect we lowered its log level. Further optimizations made it less likely that this kind of issue would happen at all.

#### [52238](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52238) Typo at NRFILES property at startscript

A typo at the `/opt/open-xchange/sbin/open-xchange` script led to a situation where custom configured "nofiles" limits where not correctly applied to the process. This has been solved by correcting the properties name and adding a log message to `open-xchange-console.log` in case the process fails to set this limit.

#### [52231](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52231) open-xchange-documentconverter-jolokia needs open-xchange-documentconverter-client package to be installed

Changed required packages from open-xchange-documentconverter to open-xchange-documentconverter-server in spec file

#### [52161](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52161) Missing mails on mobile devices when using mail categories

When using mail categories with a desktop browser and moving mails to specific categories, those mails would not be displayed at Inbox anymore when using the same account using a mobile browser. We solved this by avoiding categorization Inbox if the corresponding feature set is not available on the currently used platforms.

#### [52157](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52157) IMAP master-auth user name provided to client

In case of specific IMAP errors related to `EXPUNGE` commands, a detailed error message was returned to the user, which could contain a user-name for IMAP master authentication. This was solved by removing detailed error message contents for that IMAP command.

#### [52156](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52156) IMAP folder names shown different after update

Due to external account refactoring in 7.8.3, the "default0" prefix for "standard" IMAP folders was shown at the frontend. This got fixed by stripping that prefix in places where users would expect just the folder name.

#### [52151](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52151) Drop zone for .eml not disappearing if a file is not dropped with firefox on Windows

Firefox does not trigger `dragleave` or `mouseout` correctly.This has been fixed by using `mouseenter` to remove the dropzone when the mouse enter the window without dragged files.

#### [52123](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52123) Unable to change mail account name with certain mail configurations

If a user was changing its mail account displayname while the middleware uses a "global"
 `mailServerSource` setting, incorrect host names were applied. As a result the displayname could not be changed. We solved this by applying the appropriate host name to avoid erroneous responses during the operation.

#### [52119](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52119) Technical messages if HTML mail exceeds limits

If a HTML mail exceeds pre-defined limits, a rather harsh message is displayed at the frontend. This got polished in order to show a user friendly representation.

#### [52114](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52114) Empty page printed by browser in thread view

Single mails are printed correctly when using native browser printing (CTRL+p) but mail threads were not printed. This got fixed by handling mail threads in a more compatible way and allowing native functions to get their relevant content.

#### [52107](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52107) Inconsistency in naming order for external accounts

When changing the account name syntax of an external mail account, this change is not reflected to mail lists when reading mail sent and received by the same user. This got fixed by honoring a naming scheme which uses commas to separate last and firstname.

#### [52104](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52104) Untraceable database timeouts during share cleanup

Once the `PeriodicCleaner` task for shares was executed, potential SQL errors could not be traced since the related schema name was unknown. To allow further debugging we added`com.openexchange.database.schema` as parameter for this cleanup run. It will highlight which database schema triggered timeouts or other errors.

#### [52101](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52101) 'Folder "9" is not visible to user "X" in context "YY"

Caused by the changes for favorite folders, where favorite folders for every module were added to the collection pool. The favorite folder for drive has the parent with id "9". When the UI is refreshed, all parents of all folders are listed. That causes every refresh to request the folder with id "9".This has been fixed by only adding favorite folders for modules with granted permission.

#### [52100](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52100) Permission checks avoid changing corrupt users signatures

In case a users signature contains a faulty "createdby" header on file-level, subsequent changes to that signature were rejected based on a permission evaluation. In order to accept inconsistent data within in the system, the permission check has been removed.

#### [52095](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52095) Missing private appointments in shared folders via CalDAV

When sharing calendar folders and accessing them via CalDAV, appointments marked as "private" were not correctly synced. The same use-case works fine when using the HTTP API. This got fixed for CalDAV by considering this kind of appointment when creating responses.

#### [52067](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52067) Enter a text in the Search bar. Click on the close option but still the pop up with the text is not closed

Now clear and close dropdown on cancel to solve this issue.

#### [52022](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52022) Incorrect App launched from external accounts page

When using the hyperlink for a external storage account at the Settings-Accounts page, no or the wrong App is launched. This has been corrected and a fallback to Drive was added.

#### [52013](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52013) Enhancements to IMAP host detection and logging

To allow better debugging and monitoring of interaction between OX App Suite and IMAP backends, a new parameter was added to parse the IMAP backends "greeting" and provide it as part of the OX App Suite log. This behavior is configurable and described within release notes. When rolling out this Patch Release.

#### [51967](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51967) Missing distribution lists in Outlook

When syncing Outlook using USM, certain amounts and combinations of contacts and distribution lists could lead to a situation where only a subset of contacts but not all distribution lists got synced. This has been solved by sorting the type of object (contact, distribution list) prior to performing the sync operation. This way the kind of objects retrieved at the client side stays consistent in case the total amount of objects exceeds the chunk size for one sync operation.

#### [51960](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51960) Incorrect font for mail attachment on mobile

When using OX App Suite UI on a smartphone, the "Attachments" link within mail compose has been shown with incorrect font and color. This got fixed by applying proper mobile styles to this link.

#### [51918](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51918) Calendar conflicts with UTC+12 timezones

During conflict detection, the floating time-span of full-day appointments was calculated using the servers timezone (usually UTC) while other appointments used the timezone configured by the user. In cases where a large offset to UTC is present, there has been a 50/50 chance that appointments would conflict with full-day appointments at the previous or next day. We're now calculating both values using the users specific timezone for conflict handling. This should bring down the probability of incorrect conflicts considerably.

#### [51910](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51910) Huge amount of threads stops OX

Did some improvements to avoid a crashing OX. Utilize a user-scoped lock mechanism to avoid having a global lock that might affect unrelated threads unnecessarily. Avoid duplicate remote session look-up.

#### [51859](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51859) Changed API behavior leads to issues with file uploads

An earlier bugfix introduced a significant change to HTTP API behavior, any change to the MIME-Type parameter has been rejected as a result. While OX clients were unaffected, this led to an incompatibility with third-party clients when using the "infostore" API for uploading and modifying files. We reduced the scope of the change to block MIME-Types that start with "multipart" instead, this should not affect the vast majority of use-cases for this API.

#### [51839](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51839) Certain serious (non UCE/UBE) HTML mail is not displayed

Too greedy check for possibly malicious content led to this issue.This has been solved by allowing properly parsed start tag.

#### [51772](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51772) Unable to modify users own data

In cases where the contact associated to the user account was created by the "oxadmin" account rather than the user itself, the user was unable to change its own contact data. Such situations may arise in specific provisioning implementations. Changing the contacts data is now possible again by correcting the mechanism to look up the oxadmin account as potential creator for the own contact.

#### [51755](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51755) Long-running script warnings when sending mail to huge recipient list

When composing a mail to a list of several hundreds of recipients, browser warnings about unresponsive scripts occurred when trying to parse and tokenize the recipient list. The handling has been improved by 2-3x to allow a larger number of recipients.

#### [51727](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51727) Mail icon stills appears in UI even though mail is not enabled

Caused by missing capability check for disabling and hiding.This has been fixed by adding the missing check.

#### [51700](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51700) Guided tours showing for users even though the package was not installed

Document tours are contained in documents-ui package, existence of standard tours package was not checked there.This has been solved by adding check for existence of standard tours package, do not show tours automatically if missing, hide settings menu entry.

#### [51610](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51610) Desktop notifications are not shown for negative timezone offsets

When configuring a negative timezone offset (e.g. UTC-5), desktop notifications would not be shown since the timestamp of newly received mails was checked against UTC rather than the users timezone.

#### [51602](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51602) Incorrect encoding when using IMAP "plain" authentication

In case mailbox login names allow multi-byte Unicode characters, the login process would fail when using OX App Suite. This has been solved by applying the correct charset when performing the login procedure for mailboxes.

#### [51594](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51594) Drive opens wrong files directly after upload - wrong link in UI

indexing mismatch between the DOM nodes representing the file items and the model entries holding the file data.This has been solved by fixing the sort method.

#### [51572](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51572) Moving files with and without description not working in drive

App Suite UI just redid the same operation.Solution: App Suite UI checks which files caused conflicts and only tries to redo those.

#### [51570](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51570) Only one warning for copy multiple files with description in drive

Multiple response was not fully processed.This has been fixed by processing full array.

#### [51569](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51569) Primary mail address and aliases cannot be changed at the same time if the old primary mail address should be an alias

During the createuser command an alias for the primary mail account is already added. This alias is equal to the upper case notation used in the create command. The change command now tries to add the same alias but with only lower case letters. This isn't recognized and therefore the middleware tries to insert this alias to the db again which results in the duplicate entry error.Solution: Do a case independent check when comparing the old with the new aliases.

#### [51548](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51548) Moving files which already exist result in duplicate files with Google Drive

There was no name check performed for the move operations.This has been fixed by adding the name check to the move operation.

#### [51468](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51468) Failing to parse pre-auth from configuration

Inappropriate invocation of 'MailConfig.doCustomParsing()' lets Zimbra MAL connector fail to perform its own parsing of access information.Solution: Do call 'MailConfig.doCustomParsing()' regardless of passed parameters.

#### [51462](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51462) Full-day appointments could not be converted with Lightning

When using Thunderbird/Lightning and CalDAV of OX App Suite, full-day appointments could not be converted back to normal appointments using the CalDAV client. The reason for this was a client-specific CalDAV header used to indicate full-day appointments which caused issues with Lightning. We removed this header if the associated user-agent does not expect it.

#### [51313](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51313) Errors when adding invitations to calendar while tasks are disabled

There has been a dependency between the calendar and tasks App with regards to handling iCal files, which led to a situation that appointments could not be imported if tasks are disabled. This dependency has been relaxed to allow cases where either App is disabled.

#### [51263](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51263) Missing function returned in case requested files could not be found

A earlier fix changed the response content when requesting a frontend related file. Instead of a function and a error message, just a error message was returned. As a result the web frontend could get stuck in case a file was not found. This has been solved by providing a similar response than earlier, just with obfuscated payload.

#### [51222](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51222) Big text file load endless with the UI

The client request didn't get a response.With these changes the Viewer displays an error message if the file is too big to be loaded.

#### [51075](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51075) Missing translation for upload progress bar

When uploading files as Mail attachment or Drive object, the corresponding progress bar offered a "Cancel" button that was not translated.

#### [51074](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51074) Encoding issues with passwords

In case certain operating systems got configured incorrectly, specifically RHEL6 and SLES11, usage of the `open-xchange-passwordchange-script` plugin could lead to incorrectly encoded passwords passed over to a script. This has been solved by adding an optional parameter as described by Change #4022 to allow base64 encoded transfer. Additionally, unexpected encoding configurations will get logged to `open-xchange-console.log` to alert operators about potential follow-up issues.

#### [51053](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51053) Appointment invitations get duplicated by adding attachments

In case of a context that never existed on the system, a lookup for all contexts in the same schema lead to endless attempts to get those contexts.This has been fixed by adding the initial context to context list, if the database returns no values for the given context id. Add potential errors to output report.

#### [50804](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50804) Attached vCards could not be removed again

When adding own contact information to a Mail as vCard, that virtual attachment could not be removed afterwards. This was caused by an API change which is now reflected to mail compose.

#### [50798](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50798) Renaming a root level folder which contains a Favorite Folder will lead to "Mailfolder not found on IMAP Server"

Missing checks if parent folders get renamed or removed.This has been solved by looking for rename or removal of parent folders. On rename: anticipate changed path and keep folder. On remove: immediately remove affected favorites. This doesn't work if triggered by another client.

#### [50706](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50706) OX APP Creates too many IMAP connections and not closing them

Unnecessary global lock that leads to stacking up threads.This has been solved by removing unnecessary global lock from'com.openexchange.jslob.storage.db.DBJSlobStorage' class for improved throughput.

#### [50693](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50693) Content pane folder name not refreshed when renamed on external storage

Error handling is now done inside the apps. If errors with external storages (or other folder errors) appear and that folder is currently selected, the App will change to the default folder and reload the parent folder.

#### [50691](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50691) Shared links to external storage accounts don't work

It was possible to share folders of an external storage account as link to other internal users. Since those accounts are per-account, that link would not work though. Therefor we removed the option to send a link to such folders to other internal users.

#### [50689](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50689) Possible to lock files in external storages when not supported

The 'locks' capability was not correct for some external storages.Changed behavior: The file lock feature is disabled for every external storage. Lock does only work in the internal ox fileStore now.

Really weird HTML content inside a mail containing over 700 nested body start tag segments renders the routine running mad that tries to replace body tags with div tags for embedded display inside App Suite UI.This has been fixed by avoiding excessive replacements of body tags inside such a really weird HTML content.

#### [50598](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50598) Missing warnings for account failures at unified mail

In case a external mail account cannot be used (e.g. because the password changed), there has not been a notification to the user in order to resolve the situation. This has been changed to provide warning messages when trying to accessing a unavailable account.

#### [50574](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50574) Expiry dates for shares cannot be changed directly

Incrementing use-count for a lot of contacts associated with a certain E-Mail address causes too many INSERT statements to be issued, that do flood the MySQL service.This has been solved by accumulating use-count incrementation through a batch statement and limit the number of updated contacts that are associated with the same address. That limit is configurable through property "com.openexchange.contactcollector.searchLimit" and defaults to "5".

#### [50519](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50519) Not possible to find group in calendar permissions dialog

When using default plain-text signatures and navigating with the TAB key, the cursor would be set at the end of the signature. This has been solved in a way that the cursor will be set to the beginning of the message.

#### [50307](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50307) Incorrect translation for maximum upload size

When uploading several files which combined size exceed the maximum upload size, the related error message was related to the last file which got added. However, in such cases the error is related to the combined file size, therefor the wording has been adjusted.

#### [50303](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50303) No error message regarding "No such snippet found for identifier:" when filestore not available on login

This was caused by a missing hint that a file associated with a snippet/signature is (temporary) not available.Restored logging in case the file associated with a snippet/signature is (temporary) not available: "Missing file for snippet 1 for user X in context ctx\_ID. Maybe file storage is (temporary) not available."

The `Appointment` object at the `deleteDateFromNotoficationQueue` event was missing some typically unused data in cases where a participant deletes the appointment after accepting it. To allow compatibility with certain calendaring implementations, we now add a full `Appointment` object to the queue in such cases.

#### [49236](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49236) Huge amount of Mail folder could not be found on mail server messages for non-existing folders

We added a explicit check for environment where permission handling of own mailbox folders is disabled.

#### [40632](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=40632) Collected addresses does not work for users from the same context

In cases where multiple users are provisioned to the same context with the Global Address Book disabled, automatic contact collection of addresses that are present at the Global Address Book has not been performed.
