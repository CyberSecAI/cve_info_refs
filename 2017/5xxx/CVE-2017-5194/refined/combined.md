IRSSI-SA-2017-01 Irssi Security Advisory [1]
============================================
CVE-2017-5193, CVE-2017-5194, CVE-2017-5356, CVE-2017-5195, CVE-2017-5196
Description
-----------
Multiple vulnerabilities have been located in Irssi.
(a) NULL pointer dereference in the nickcmp function found by Joseph
Bisch. (CWE-690)
CVE-2017-5193 [2] was assigned to this issue.
(b) Use after free when receiving invalid nick message. (CWE-417)
CVE-2017-5194 [3] was assigned to this issue.
(c) Out of bounds read when printing the value %[ found by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
(CWE-126)
CVE-2017-5356 [4] was assigned to this issue.
(d) Out of bounds read in certain incomplete control codes found by
Joseph Bisch. (CWE-126)
CVE-2017-5195 [5] was assigned to this issue.
(e) Out of bounds read in certain incomplete character sequences found
by Hanno BÃ¶ck and independently by Joseph Bisch. (CWE-126)
CVE-2017-5196 [6] was assigned to this issue.
Impact
------
These issues may result in denial of service (remote crash).
Affected versions
-----------------
(a) All Irssi versions that we observed
(b) All Irssi versions that we observed
(c) All Irssi versions that we observed
(d) Irssi 0.8.17 and later
(e) Irssi 0.8.18 and later
Fixed in
--------
Irssi 0.8.21, Irssi 1.0.0
Recommended action
------------------
Upgrade to Irssi 0.8.21. Irssi 0.8.21 is a maintenance release without
any new features.
After installing the updated packages, one can issue the /upgrade
command to load the new binary. TLS connections will require /reconnect.
A Note to Distributors
----------------------
First of all, thanks to every maintainer for their awesome job in
packaging Irssi and backporting security fixes.
When we had to release a security advisory last year with Irssi 0.8.20,
we noticed there was a huge confusion amongst Ubuntu users about whether
their Irssi version was safe to use.
Since all our releases 0.8.18, 0.8.19, 0.8.20 and 0.8.21 have been bug
fix only, we think distributions should just ship the release.
But if the security fixes only are backported on top of an old version,
we would like to urge distributions to consider indicating this in a way
that is visible inside Irssi. One way to do this would be to manually
overwrite the PACKAGE\_VERSION and marking your package as patched. This
can be done for example like this:
./configure PACKAGE\_VERSION=0.8.17-sa201701
You can then check the version from inside Irssi with /eval echo $J
As an added benefit over relying on dpkg, this will also correctly
report whether you had /upgrade done or not. We are looking for a ways
to make this easier to handle for both packagers and us, so if you have
a good idea on this matter please speak forth.
Mitigating facts
----------------
(a) requires control over the ircd
(b) require control over the ircd or otherwise can be triggered /
avoided by the user themselves
(c) can be triggered / avoided by the user themselves
(e) require control over the ircd or otherwise can be triggered /
avoided by the user themselves

Discussion
----------
(a) CVE-2017-5193: A NULL pointer dereference in the nickcmp function
found by Joseph Bisch.
The irc\_query\_find function will call nick\_comp\_func in order to
retrieve an associated existing query.
However, the precondition whether nick was not NULL was not
verified, leading to incorrect API usage of the nick\_comp\_func and
ultimately NULL pointer dereference resulting in a crash whenever
the server produced such a message without nick.
(b) CVE-2017-5194: Use after free when receiving invalid nick message.
Irssi is programmed to cancel the connection when the server
indicates an invalid nick during the registration phase (in the
event\_nick\_invalid function), because Irssi cannot recover from
this.
A complex (and still not properly fixed) chain of signal
dependencies emitted by the server\_disconnect function, combined
with the lack of reference counting, leads to multiple use after
free issues when the server object has already been destroyed, but
there is currently no way to inform the surrounding code of this
fact.
As a mitigation, the server\_disconnect function is no longer used
in this case and instead the clean-up is pushed to some upper layer.
Fixing this properly will still be a lot of work.
(c) CVE-2017-5356: Out of bounds read when Printing the value %[ Found
by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
The formatting sequence %[...] can be used to execute the timestamp
and "line\_start" commands on each printed line.
The scanner in format\_expand\_styles will expect it to read unto the
closing ], but in case the end of string has already been reached
while searching for the closing bracket, calling code is not
prepared to deal with this and may advance the char\* beyond end of
string.
(d) CVE-2017-5195: Out of bounds read in certain incomplete control
codes found by Joseph Bisch.
While parsing the ANSI x8 colour codes, Irssi in many cases failed
to check whether the end of string had already been reached,
resulting in this vulnerability.
(e) CVE-2017-5196: Out of bounds read in certain incomplete character
sequences found by Hanno BÃ¶ck and independently by J. Bisch.
When copying characters to the terminal screen in the term\_addstr
function, the g\_utf8\_get\_char function was used unconditionally
without verifying that the input string is proper utf8. As the
behaviour of that function is undefined for invalid input, it would
result in this invalid memory access. The correction is to use the
g\_utf8\_get\_char\_validated function instead.
