Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `cdk_pk_get_keyid` function in `lib/opencdk/pubkey.c` of GnuTLS.
- A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient checks when processing certain fields within a specially crafted OpenPGP certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated memory on the stack.
- Improper input validation: The function does not adequately validate the size or format of input related to OpenPGP certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   A successful exploitation could lead to a crash of the application using GnuTLS.
-   It is also possible (although not explicitly mentioned in the original CVE description, but in associated bug reports) that an attacker may gain the ability to execute arbitrary code by controlling the return address, leading to potential system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Remote Attack: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted OpenPGP certificate.
-   Network based: The vulnerable application receives and processes certificates from remote sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted OpenPGP certificate to an application using GnuTLS which utilizes the OpenPGP certificate functionality.
- No specific authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The upstream GnuTLS project considers OpenPGP certificate support in GnuTLS to be obsolete, and discourages its use.
- The vulnerability was discovered using the OSS-FUZZ fuzzer infrastructure.
- Patches for this issue were released in GnuTLS 3.3.26 and 3.5.8.
- Red Hat and SUSE both released security patches addressing this vulnerability in their respective products.
- SUSE rated the vulnerability as "moderate" while RedHat rated this as “important”.
