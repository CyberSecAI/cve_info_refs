The provided content is related to CVE-2017-5251.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Insteon Hub uses a 915MHz Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) communication protocol to communicate with connected devices. The radio transmissions are not encrypted and lack security mechanisms to prevent replay attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unencrypted radio transmissions
- Lack of protection against capture-replay attacks

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious actor can capture and replay radio signals to manipulate connected devices, such as garage door locks, leading to unauthorized control of the Insteon Hub environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- Capture of radio signals using software-defined radio (SDR).
- Replay of the captured signals to the Insteon Hub.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Close proximity to the Insteon Hub to capture radio signals.
- Ability to use SDR equipment and software to capture and replay radio signals.
