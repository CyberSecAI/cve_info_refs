Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a **missing or improper check for a valid CSRF token** in the ntopng web interface's admin scripts. The code does not validate the CSRF token, allowing requests to be executed without a valid token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Token Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation for CSRF tokens. The application checks only for the existence of the `csrf` parameter in the request, without verifying its validity against a stored or expected value. This allows attackers to bypass CSRF protection.
*   **Missing CSRF Protection on Admin Functions:** The vulnerability affects multiple administrative functions including `add_user`, `change_user_prefs`, `delete_user`, and `password_reset`, allowing attackers to execute these functions without authorization via CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform administrative actions on behalf of a logged-in user, such as:
    *   Changing the admin password
    *   Adding new users with administrative privileges
    *   Modifying user preferences
    *   Deleting existing users
*   **Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly mentioned, some administrative actions might lead to indirect information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Links:** An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a logged-in user, executes administrative functions.
*   **Attacker Webpage:** An attacker can embed malicious code (e.g., a form with hidden inputs) on a webpage that, when visited by a logged-in user, triggers the vulnerable admin functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, as it is an issue with the web interface.
*   **Target User Authentication:** The attacker relies on a victim user being authenticated (logged in) to the ntopng web interface. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves but needs a valid authenticated user as a target.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides examples of how to exploit the CSRF vulnerability, including changing the admin password and adding arbitrary users.
*   The commit logs show the fix for this vulnerability which involves checking for the existence of the CSRF token. This effectively checks if a csrf parameter is provided in the GET request, but it doesn't validate the actual token value
*   The vulnerability affects ntopng version 2.4.160627.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a classic CSRF bypass due to insufficient validation of the CSRF token. This allows a remote attacker to perform administrative actions if a logged-in user is tricked into visiting a malicious link or page. This can lead to privilege escalation and other security compromises.
