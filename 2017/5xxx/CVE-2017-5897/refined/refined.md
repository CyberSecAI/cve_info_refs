{
  "CVE-2017-5897": {
    "Description": "Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read flaw in the ip6gre_err function in the IPv6 networking code.",
    "Root cause": "The `ip6gre_err` function in the Linux kernel's IPv6 GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) implementation had an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The function incorrectly calculated the offset for accessing GRE key data when the GRE header included a key field, leading to reading beyond the allocated buffer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect offset calculation",
       "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from kernel memory by triggering this out-of-bounds read. This might also cause a denial of service due to a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "A crafted GRE packet with specific flags can trigger the vulnerability during error handling in the `ip6gre_err` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system to trigger the `ip6gre_err` function. No specific privileges are mentioned, but being on the network is necessary."
