Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-5375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from excessive JIT (Just-In-Time) code allocation within the Firefox and Thunderbird browsers' JavaScript engine. Specifically, the lack of a limit on the amount of executable memory that could be allocated by asm.js/WebAssembly code allowed attackers to bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Excessive JIT Code Allocation:** The primary weakness is the ability to create a large number of executable memory regions through the JIT compiler, ultimately filling the address space and making the location of the JIT-compiled code predictable. This defeats ASLR and DEP.
*   **Predictable Code Location:**  The JIT compilation process led to the generated code being placed in memory at predictable addresses. This was possible because of the way memory was allocated for the JITed code. 
*   **Missing Constant Blinding:** Attackers can use the trick to hide their opcodes/payload/shellcode within the constants.
*   **Insecure Communication Methods in Developer Tools JSON viewer**
*   **Use-after-free** while manipulating XSL in XSLT documents
*   **Pointer and frame data leakage** of Javascript objects
*    **Potential use-after-free** during DOM manipulations
*   **Use-after-free** with Media Decoder
*   **Location bar spoofing** with unicode characters
*   **WebExtensions** can use data: protocol to affect other extensions

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypass of ASLR and DEP:** Attackers can circumvent these security mechanisms, which are designed to make it harder to predict the location of code and data in memory.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By bypassing ASLR and DEP, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the browser (Firefox or Thunderbird).
*   **Information leaks:** through pointer and frame data leakage of JavaScript objects
*    **Denial of Service:** through potential use-after-free during DOM manipulations and excessive JIT code allocation.
*  **Privilege escalation:** through insecure communication methods in Developer Tools JSON viewer.
*  **Location bar spoofing:**
*   **Data disclosure and privilege escalation in affected extensions:** WebExtensions can use data: protocol to affect other extensions

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Pages:** A malicious webpage containing crafted asm.js code can trigger the vulnerability when loaded in a vulnerable browser.
*   **Email:** In Thunderbird (although less impactful due to disabled scripting by default) specially crafted emails could trigger the vulnerability
*   **Media Files:** A use-after-free vulnerability can be exploited while working with media files when some events are fired after the media elements are freed from memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely by getting a user to open a malicious website or email.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Software:**  The attacker needs to target a specific version of Firefox or Thunderbird, understanding the memory layout and the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Code:** The attacker needs the ability to craft asm.js or wasm code which will then be JIT compiled to a predictable location in memory.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The exploit uses a technique called "JIT-spraying", where the attacker forces the JIT compiler to generate a large amount of executable code, which is then placed in predictable locations.
*   The attack makes use of how Firefox/Thunderbird allocates and manages memory for JIT compiled JavaScript/WebAssembly code.
*   The exploits rely on the fact that, in vulnerable versions, the JIT compiler does not have limits on the total memory allocated for executable code and may create many executable regions at predictable base addresses, which then can be used for RCE (Remote Code Execution)
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a webpage that contains malicious javascript.
*   The vulnerability is exploited via crafted asm.js (later wasm) code that causes the JIT compiler to allocate an excessive number of RX regions.

**Mitigation and Fixes (from the provided content):**
*   **Randomization of executable memory allocation:** Patches were introduced to randomize the base addresses of all JIT-compiled code, which prevents attacks relying on specific, hard-coded memory addresses.
*   **Limits on Executable Memory:** The amount of executable memory that a process can allocate was limited. (e.g., 128 MB in 32-bit systems, 512 MB in 64-bit) to prevent an attacker from filling all the memory.
*  **discarding of RegExp and unboxed-constructor code**
*   **Updates:** The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 51, Firefox ESR 45.7, and Thunderbird 45.7.  Users are recommended to upgrade to these or later versions.

**CVE-2017-5375**  is explicitly mentioned as the vulnerability being fixed in the following Red Hat Security Advisories:
*   RHSA-2017:0190 (Firefox)
*   RHSA-2017:0238 (Thunderbird)

The exploit database entry 44293 and 44294 provide a proof-of-concept for this vulnerability.

In summary, the provided content describes a serious vulnerability related to JIT-spraying that allowed attackers to bypass critical security mechanisms to execute arbitrary code. The fixes involve introducing randomization and quotas to how executable memory is allocated during JIT operations in affected products.
