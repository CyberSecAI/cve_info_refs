                 CVE-2017-5410

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code or information leaks.

With this update, the Icedove packages are de-branded back to the official
Mozilla branding. With the removing of the Debian branding the packages
are also renamed back to the official names used by Mozilla.

The Thunderbird package is using a different default profile folder,
the default profile folder is now '$(HOME)/.thunderbird'.
The users profile folder, that was used in Icedove, will get migrated
to the new profile folder on the first start, that can take a little bit
more time.

Please read README.Debian for getting more information about the
changes.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.8.0-3~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Topic

An update for firefox is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of

code changes.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

This update upgrades Firefox to version 45.7.0 ESR.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

    Notes:
    *) very similar to CVE-2016-2819, but still different:
    *) this PoC (CVE-2016-1960) does trigger in 44.0.2 but not in 46.0.1
       because in 46.0.1 it is already fixed.
    *) CVE-2016-2819 does trigger the same bug in 44.0.2 and 46.0.1 because it
       was fixed in Firefox > 46.0.1

non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Jan de Mooij, Tom Schuster, and Oriol reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

    FULL ASLR AND DEP BYPASS USING ASM.JS JIT SPRAY (CVE-2017-5375)
    PoC Exploit against Firefox 50.0.1 (CVE-2016-9079 - Tor Browser 0day)

    Tested on:

    Release 50.0.1 32-bit - Windows 8.1 / Windows 10
    https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/50.0.1/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2050.0.1.exe

    Howto:

    1) serve PoC over network and open it in Firefox 50.0.1 32-bit
    2) if you don't see cmd.exe, open processexplorer and verify that cmd.exe was spawned by firefox.exe

    A successfull exploit attempt should pop cmd.exe

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

[PoC for Firefox 50.1.0 (Release). Demonstrates point 2.1 in the report](attachment.cgi?id=8820887)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8820887&action=edit)

asm.js allows to JIT-spray attacker controlled code, and hence, allows to fully
bypass ASLR and DEP in 32-bit (x86) Firefox (Tested versions: Release and
Nightly). As it is very easy to find, I do not know if it is already known (I
hope I do not reinvent the wheel here...)
In summary this means, that an attacker can exploit a memory corruption
vulnerability (such as an UAF) as if no ASLR and DEP existed. He only needs EIP
control and does not need any memory disclosures/info-leaks or code-reuse. That
makes exploitation of memory corruptions for an attacker super easy.
Consider following asm.js script:
<script>
function asm\_js\_module(){
"use asm"
function asm\_js\_function(){
/\* attacker controlled asm.js code \*/
}
return asm\_js\_function
}
modules = []
/\* create 0x1000 executable regions containing our code \*/
for (i=0; i<0x1000; i++){
/\* request asm.js module \*/
modules[i] = asm\_js\_module()
}
</script>
Each time an asm.js module is requested, VirtualAlloc is called and returns a
new RW (PAGE\_READWRITE) region aligned to 0xXXXX0000. At that point the call
stack looks like this (Firefox 50.1.0):

Afterwards, the asm.js compiled/native code is copied to the RW region
(firefox-50.1.0/js/src/asmjs/WasmCode.cpp:223 in method CodeSegment::create):
223 memcpy(cs->code(), bytecode.begin(), bytecode.length());
224 StaticallyLink(\*cs, linkData, cx);
225 if (memory)
226 SpecializeToMemory(\*cs, metadata, memory);
227 }
228
229 if (!ExecutableAllocator::makeExecutable(cs->code(), cs->codeLength())) {
And in line 229 the RW region is made executable (PAGE\_EXECUTE\_READ) with
ExecutableAllocator::makeExecutable which calls VirtualProtect.
An attacker can request one asm.js module many times, which leads to the
creation of many RX regions. Due to the allocation granularity of VirtualAlloc
he can then choose a fixed address (such as 0x1c1c0000) and can be certain that
his compiled/native asm.js code is located there.
IMO following flaws/missing checks are responsible that asm.js JIT-spray is
possible. Some of them are well known:
1) Not MANY, but only ONE RX region should be created per module. Many requests
to one asm.js module should return references instead of new RX regions.
2.1) Constant folding is missing in Release (50.1.0). (But it seems it was
added in Nightly between 18 Nov. 2016 and 30 Nov. 2016). This makes it possible
to use many subsequent arithmetic operations on one variable and wrap the
legitimate instructions.
For example, we can hide three NOPS (0x90) in asm.js constants with:
VAL = (VAL + 0xA8909090)|0;
VAL = (VAL + 0xA8909090)|0;
Following native code is generated:
00: 05909090A8 ADD EAX, 0xA8909090
05: 05909090A8 ADD EAX, 0xA8909090
When we jump into offset 01 (the immediate of the first instruction) we can
execute our hidden code (We'll use 0xA8 as masking byte):
01: 90 NOP
02: 90 NOP
03: 90 NOP
04: A805 TEST AL, 05
06: 90 NOP
07: 90 NOP
08: 90 NOP
09: A8...
2.2) Although constant folding/propagation seems to be implemented in Nightly,
an attacker can still force to emit his hidden code: for example, he can hide
two nops and a jump to the next constant with following asm.js code:
asm\_js\_heap[0x10] = 0xEB069090;
asm\_js\_heap[0x11] = 0xEB069090;
asm.js emits following native code:
00: B89090EB06 MOV EAX, 0x06EB9090
05: A340C07B04 MOV DWORD [0x047BC040], EAX
0A: B89090EB06 MOV EAX, 0x06EB9090
0F: A344C07B04 MOV DWORD [0x047BC044], EAX
But when we jump into offset 01, we get:
01: 90 NOP
02: 90 NOP
03: EB06 JMP 0x0B
..
0B: 90 NOP
0C: 90 NOP
0D: EB06 JMP 0x15
..
2.3) Another possibility is to use FFI and pass many parameters to it.
Consider following asm.js code:
heap[10] = ffi(0x90909090|0, 0x90909090|0, 0x90909090|0, 0x90909090|0, /\* and many more\*/ )
Following native code is emitted (Nightly 53.0a1 20161215061212 32-bit - Windows 10):
0:026> u 1c1c0053
1c1c0053 90 nop
1c1c0054 90 nop
1c1c0055 90 nop
1c1c0056 c744240c90909090 mov dword ptr [esp+0Ch],90909090h
1c1c005e c744241090909090 mov dword ptr [esp+10h],90909090h
1c1c0066 c744241490909090 mov dword ptr [esp+14h],90909090h
1c1c006e c744241890909090 mov dword ptr [esp+18h],90909090h
1c1c0076 c744241c90909090 mov dword ptr [esp+1Ch],90909090h
This again allows to use two bytes as payload bytes and two bytes as jump to
the next constant.
3) There is no constant blinding of 4-byte constants. Hence, an attacker can
use the well known trick to hide his opcodes/payload/shellcode within the
constants (as shown in 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).
4) There is insufficient random nop insertion. It seems that the same amount
and type of nops are emitted for a specific module. That means, that the native
code of one module is fully predictable. An attacker can test his code and use
it across other machines with the same OS/Firefox version (am I missing here
sth.?). Better random nop insertion would break 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. More random
base addresses, each time the same module is used would help, too. Separating
code from data such as using a constant pool for constants might also help.
To demonstrate that this asm.js JIT-spray works, I attached several proof of
concepts for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 (including an exploit for
[CVE-2016-9079](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-9079), the recent Tor Browser 0day). I have also exploits for
[CVE-2016-1960](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-1960) and [CVE-2016-2819](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-2819), but the attached PoCs should proof the point.
Information how to test them is available in the PoCs.
Principally, asm.js JIT-spray should work for Linux, too. However, mmap returns
regions on a 4 KB granularity, hence more modules need to be sprayed to occupy
a predictable address. I did not investigate any possibilities for 64-bit
Firefox. However it might also be affected in one or another way.
I think JIT hardening was also tracked by
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=677272](/show_bug.cgi?id=677272 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - JIT hardening").
Please correct me if anything is wrong or if I missed something. Or ping me if
one of the PoCs does not work or if you need more information.

Do we have any JIT-spray prevention for normal JIT code or is it just the fact that JIT code compilation is more complicated and thus harder to predict?
If we offset the entire module's code by some random offset (maintaining 16-byte alignment) within the entire RW allocation, would that be sufficient to prevent placing code at predictable addresses?

For non-asm.js/wasm code, we use ExecutableAllocator::computeRandomAllocationAddress on Windows and pass the result of that to VirtualAlloc. Should we do something similar for asm.js/wasm? Not sure it would help here, I didn't look closely at the POC.
It might also be worth limiting how much executable memory a Zone/JSRuntime can allocate, I vaguely remember Chakra doing this. We do have MaxWasmCodeAllocations FWIW.Flags: needinfo?(hv1989) → needinfo?(luke)

I quickly looked at ExecutableAllocator::computeRandomAllocationAddress (50.1.0 source, 32-bit) and think that this would not really help, because VirtuaAlloc would still deliver 64-KB aligned chunks. Although the base addresses become more random, I suspect that enough requests to one asm.js module would yield predictable addresses at some point (This is a bit of a wild guess right now, I didn't do the exact calculations yet)

If the offset is different within each RW region that would help against point 2.2 and 2.3. But it would still be possible (with a chance of 4/5) to hit the nop sled and land in attacker controlled code (point 2.1).

I expect the same nop-sled attack would work against normal JIT code since we're using the same backend. So that's a separate mitigation we should consider.
Rather, it seems like the problem here is lack of quota allowing the attacker to fill up the address space with executable code (which defeats randomization). For asm.js/wasm, though, MaxWasmCodeAllocations isn't quite good enough since it's just number of modules and one can easily generate 100mb modules. But if we added a parallel MaxWasmCodeBytes, I think that would work and not be too hard.

No, we should probably fix that at the same time...

Luke, what about the following:
(1) Rejigger things so we use computeRandomAllocationAddress for asm.js/wasm code allocations as well.
(2) Add |Atomic<uint32\_t> codeBytesAllocated;| so we can enforce how much executable memory a single process can allocate. I think this is nicer than having it on the runtime, because a malicious website could create many workers to spray the heap. I'm just not sure what a reasonable quota would be for the whole process...Flags: needinfo?(jdemooij) → needinfo?(luke)

Also, how feasible would it be to use the ExecutableAllocator (maybe a different instance) for wasm executable memory? That could also be more efficient when there are many small modules, just one RX mapping.

Jan: yes, (1) and (2) sound like exactly what I was thinking as well. Would you be able to add codeBytesAllocated and the ExecutableAllocator integration? After that, (1) and (2) are trivial to do in WasmCode.cpp.
Regarding ExecutableAllocator: that's a good question. We used to mprotect() all the code (for the interrupt handler) which required page alignment, but not anymore. The other reason we (still) need page alignment of the code pages is that they need to be followed by some number of r+w global data pages. When we (soon) implement code-sharing-between-instances, we'll be moving all the writable global data out, leaving only some read-only process-invariant data (pointers to C functions, etc). Then we could make the entire allocation r+x and thus page-alignment-agnostic and switch to ExecutableAllocator.Flags: needinfo?(luke)

Attached patch

[Part 1 - Randomize asm.js/wasm code addresses on Windows](attachment.cgi?id=8825903&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8825903&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1325200&attachment=8825903)

This patch renames ExecutableAllocator::computeRandomAllocationAddress to ComputeRandomAllocationAddress and calls it from AllocateExecutableMemory instead of ExecutableAllocator::systemAlloc, so it works for \*all\* code allocations.
This also lets us remove the |addr| argument from AllocateExecutableMemory.
One issue was that we used a XorShift128PlusRNG in ExecutableAllocator for this, but we don't have a good place to store this state for ComputeRandomAllocationAddress. I removed this RNG and now we just call js::GenerateRandomSeed on each allocation. This looks fine perf-wise, is simpler, and as bonus should also give us a stronger RNG for this.
Pretty happy with how this turned out.Assignee: nobody → jdemooijStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDFlags: needinfo?(jdemooij)

[Part 2 - Limit executable memory per process](attachment.cgi?id=8825908&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1325200&attachment=8825908)

This puts a hard per-process limit on the executable memory we allocate. On 32-bit platforms the limit is 128 MB, on 64-bit platforms 512 MB (because the virtual address space is much larger there).
JS\_ShutDown asserts the counter is 0 to make sure the counter is updated correctly.
The asserts here caught a pre-existing OOM bug actually (we called systemRelease twice in createPool). This should be extremely rare in non-OOM-testing scenarios and hard to exploit, but it's a nice find anyway :)

Note that there's still the problem of VirtualAlloc having a granularity of 64K :( That will be fixed when we use the ExecutableAllocator for wasm code, as discussed, but until then I wonder if we should also cap the \*number\* of allocations to account for this.
Maybe we should lower MaxWasmCodeAllocations to 1000 or so on 32-bit, to stop the "spray many small modules" attack?Flags: needinfo?(luke)

When you allocate 2^16 modules (64 KB alignment each), the whole address space is filled up on 32-bit, so there are 65536 possibilities. Let's say each module is 2 pages. A 128 MB limit lets you then allocate 16384 modules: 128 MB / 8192 KB. That means a JIT spray still has a decent chance of success (1 out of 4 or so).Flags: needinfo?(luke)

Oh, I see, I was taking the probability to be 1 in 32 (4gb / 128mb) but I was indeed forgetting about the hidden VirtualAlloc unit size. Good point! Really it sounds like, on Windows, we need to round up the amount we increment allocatedExecutableBytes by to 64kb (regardless of wasm, because that is the underlying effect on overall address space randomization).Flags: needinfo?(luke)

It can be used to bypass ASLR/DEP once an attacker has an exploit for another bug.

We will now limit the amount of executable memory to 128 MB per process on 32-bit (and 512 MB on 64-bit). The biggest risk is users getting OOMs from this. I don't expect it, as 128 MB is a lot of code and we purge JIT code quite aggressively, but it is somewhat of a risk.

This also removes the bogus RandomizeIsBroken code that [bug 1232907](/show_bug.cgi?id=1232907 "RESOLVED FIXED - Enable ExecutableAllocator randomization on Windows XP") removed in 46; it's less risk to use the same code everywhere.

I filed [bug 1330780](/show_bug.cgi?id=1330780 "RESOLVED WONTFIX") on inserting a random number of bytes between functions, but as discussed there we'd first need some mitigation against nop slides, maybe some form of constant blinding as suggested here. Unfortunately constant blinding is hard to do in a way that's both really effective and has acceptable performance overhead. For instance, [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325200#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - lack of executable-code quota allows full bypass of ASLR and DEP") mentions blinding 4 byte constants, but ISTR some papers suggest you need to do this even for 2-byte constants to be effective. Last I checked, no other engines take the performance hit from this (except Chakra maybe) or they do it only in very limited cases like their Baseline JIT.
I'll file some followup bugs though to investigate our options.Flags: needinfo?(jdemooij)

Hi, can you please offer some guidance if this needs manual QA? I saw in [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325200#c29 "VERIFIED FIXED - lack of executable-code quota allows full bypass of ASLR and DEP") that no QA is required but the bug has qe-verify+.
Things that I did and saw until now:
I am running the poc files in 50.0.1 and I got a notification "Set EIP to 0x1c1c0053 (Firefox Release <= 50.1.0 32-bit - Windows 8.1/10) with your vuln here or in WinDBG" and in 51.0 I don't (for any of the poc files). I see that I need to set EIP to different values, after a quick search I saw that i need to use OllyDbg, but don't know how to use that.Flags: needinfo?(mwobensmith)Flags: needinfo?(jdemooij)

Hi Bogdan, we had hoped the verification would just involve running the PoC files to confirm the change in behavior. You've done that, so maybe this bug should be considered verified.

It's expected you don't see the message in Firefox 51. We now OOM because we allocate too much JIT code so we don't get to the alert. That confirms the quota fix works correctly.Flags: needinfo?(jdemooij)

> Hi Rh0, can you confirm that this has been fixed correctly? Thank you.
The above attached PoCs are mitigated but I think I have found a way to circumvent the fixes. The basic idea is that the same tricks can be used as in heap feng shui / heap spray (Allocate memory, deallocate memory) to create allocation holes at predictable base address. These holes can then be used to place jit-sprayed regions there.
Simple Example (very first test):
1) Allocate many unrelated memory regions (e.g.: Uint32Array(0x100000)) to occupy very many 64 KB base addresses. This reserves (but does not commit) memory up to an target address (e.g.: 0x50000000)
2) Jit-spray max allowed executable memory. Last time i checked MaxCodeBytesPerProcess was at 160\*1024\*1024 bytes (source: Firefox 51.0). The smallest asm-js/JIT module chunk is 64\*1024, so an attacker can spray up to (190\*1024\*1024)/(64\*1024) = 2560 modules to occupy 64KB-aligned base addresses with controlled code.
3) Then, I think due to few memory space available, 2560 modules seems enough: the code of fix-part1 will fallback to "normal" VirtualAlloc instead of using randomAddr for VirtualAlloc.
4) Memory allocated in 1) may be released by triggering the garbage collector.
In (very) first tests I was able to get attacker controlled code reliably to predictable addresses in version 51.0 (win32) and Nightly (from Jan. 23 2017; win32).
I'll provide PoC later on. (Should I file a new bug on it?)
Thanks!
Rh0

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
