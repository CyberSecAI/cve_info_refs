User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:42.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/42.0
Build ID: 20151029151421
Steps to reproduce:
With Firefox 42 for Android , it's possible to make Clickjacking /CSRF attacks and possible URL and SSL Spoofing.
Step1 : go to <https://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/android-Firefox42.0-Clickjacking-CSRF-URL-and-SSL%20Spoofing/testfs.html> and click on the step1 link.
Step2 : click on the step2 Link.
step3 : an alert() JavaScript Function will be used for redirect the user on the tab opened by the first link (step1 link) and the location bar will appears like a secure webpage and show "<https://mobile.twitter.com/session/new>" but the visible content of the webpage is the content of "<https://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/android-Firefox42.0-Clickjacking-CSRF-URL-and-SSL%20Spoofing/testfs.html>" if your login and password for mobile.twitter.com is registred , by clicking on the button "ClickJack-twitter-login" you will be connected on your twitter account ( i will uploaded you a video and a screenshot for show you what this vulnerability is exactly)
Actual results:
An attacker can use this vulnerability for make clickjacking /CSRF attacks and possibly URL ans SSL Spoofing.
Expected results:
The visible content of the webpage is wrong and the real content of the URL showed is invisible and this can lead to ClickJacking and Cross-Site Request Forgery and also possible URL ans SSL Spoofing.

(The testcase has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5 4g+ and works very well)
In fact, the visible content is the content of the attacker webpage (eg: attacker.com) , but the real content is the content of the URL showed in the Location Bar (eg: bank.com) , its content is invisible but can be clicked , so this vulnerability can be used for multiple reason: ClickJacking attacks / CSRF attacks and I think it's possible to use this vulnerability for spoofed the URL and SSL into the location bar leading to a Location Bar Spoofing vulnerability, with the URL and the SSL indicator spoofed.
I will make a video for demonstrate you the dangerosity of this vulnerability soon (for an attack of ClickJacking / CSRF ).

Confirming (in Beta). The test loads twitter in an background tab which ends up drawing the twitter URL bar on top of the attacker's fullscreen page. Also uses alerts to steal focus back to the intended tab, which we're getting rid of on desktop because it's used for spoofing like pop-unders. I guess I should check on Nightly because that feature may have come to Fennec (different front end so maybe not).Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWtracking-fennec: ? → ---Ever confirmed: trueOS: Android → UnspecifiedHardware: ARM → Unspecified

The result is a pretty convincing spoof because the URL bar is real and functional, although if you go to the tab chooser and back then you get the real content. Can't quite rate it "high" because of the clunkiness of multiple clicks and waiting for things to load (will raise suspicions).Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

For Daniel Veditz: look [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222798#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 43 for Android : Clickjacking / CSRF attacks and Location Bar Spoofing (URL and SSL Spoofing)") before to read this comment.
Like you can view in this video ( <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8684962> ) into the attachments in this bug report,
This vulnerability can be used also for ClickJacking/CSRF attacks and I think that we can execute a XPI addon silently by a simple click on a button which is placed at the same place where the button of confirmation allowing the execution of this addon is also placed ( this attack is remotely possible ).
And like I already said in the [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222798#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 43 for Android : Clickjacking / CSRF attacks and Location Bar Spoofing (URL and SSL Spoofing)") where i sent a "needinfo flag" to Daniel Veditz {dveditz@mozilla.com} , I think that the actual testcase can be reduced.
Explaination : I think than it's possible to code a testcase wich require to click on only one link ( excepted the clicks on the alert() JavaScript functions which are needed for the actual exploitation).
But it is probable that we can reduce or use others functions than alert() for crafted a testcase which require a click on only one link , which also allowing to define this vulnerability like sg:high .Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

I've makes some tests for try to execute silently a XPI addon but i haven't found a way for do this.

This vulnerability works on all Firefox versions :
Firefox 44.0.2 (stable) , Firefox 45.0b9 (Beta) , Firefox 47.0a1 (Nightly) ...
Al, could you assign someone to code a patch for this vulnerability please?
In the last similar vulnerability ( [Bug 1149000](/show_bug.cgi?id=1149000 "RESOLVED FIXED - Killing the Location bar using fullscreen mode and alert function on another tab (spoofing risk)") ) , Kartikaya Gupta ( bugmail.mozilla@staktrace.com or kats@mozilla.com ) has been assigned and i think he could be again assigned for this new report.

Unfortunately at the moment I don't have a lot of time to dig into this. Do you know what we would need to fix in the browser to stop this vulnerability? Is it that the alert dialog can cause switching to another tab while remaining in fullscreen?

(Sorry for the first needinfo without comment , it's an error of manipulation)
This vulnerability works again on all Firefox versions :
Firefox 45.0.1 (stable) , Firefox 46.0b4 (Beta) , Firefox 48.0a1 (Nightly) ...
I hope that this vulnerability allowing spoofing of URL and SSL, and also allowing clickjacking attacks and again others malicious results will be corrected quickly and that it does not happen the same problem that in [Bug1158439](/show_bug.cgi?id=1158439 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Cursor Can be totally invisible using flash object into an iframe with a big padding allow clickjacking of the addon installation button") (which have been defined obsolete after several updates due to multiple change of parameters essential to exploit this vulnerability).
So it is important to fix this vulnerability before that an update make it impossible to reproduce the proof of concept of this security bug report.
I've needinfo some Mozilla people which have also previously fixed some vulnerabilities in Firefox for Android.
Someone of you that i "needinfo?" can try to fix this vulnerability please?

What will change in a update that makes it impossible to reproduce this security issue? A change in Twitter's website? Ideally we should create a reduced testcase that doesn't depend on an external website.
Can you answer kats's question from [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222798#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox 43 for Android : Clickjacking / CSRF attacks and Location Bar Spoofing (URL and SSL Spoofing)")? What is your recommended fix here?

For example: [Bug884488](/show_bug.cgi?id=884488 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Execute a XPI cover by a select/option element") and [Bug1158439](/show_bug.cgi?id=1158439 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Cursor Can be totally invisible using flash object into an iframe with a big padding allow clickjacking of the addon installation button") haven't been fixed but after several update, thses vulnerabilities have been defined obsolete even if these update haven't a fix for these Bug.

On Nightly 48.0a1 for Android ,
if you use a mouse connected to the android device, the testcase must use the onclick event because this Firefox Nightly version don't use the ontouchstart if you click with a cusor.
So in the Nightly 48.0a1 for android you must use onclick event and ontouchstart event (onclick event if a cursor is used and ontouchstart event if you touch the screen).Flags: needinfo?(jordi.chancel)

This testcase works perfectly on:
1) Firefox 45.0.1 (stable version)
2) Firefox 46.0b(\*) (Beta version).
But on Firefox 48.0a(\*) (Nightly vserion) you must use the last testcase uploaded for Nightly if you use a cursor on your Android device.

Sebastian, could you look in priority this vulnerability before the [Bug1227538](/show_bug.cgi?id=1227538 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Javascript:\" URL scheme can seem secure with a SSL indicator (leading to SSL Spoofing) and the wrong URL indicated can mislead the user about the real URL visited.") plase?
It's because the severity and the impact of this vulnerability are more important than [Bug1227538](/show_bug.cgi?id=1227538 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Javascript:\" URL scheme can seem secure with a SSL indicator (leading to SSL Spoofing) and the wrong URL indicated can mislead the user about the real URL visited."). and you was assigned on it before [Bug1227538](/show_bug.cgi?id=1227538 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Javascript:\" URL scheme can seem secure with a SSL indicator (leading to SSL Spoofing) and the wrong URL indicated can mislead the user about the real URL visited.").

@snorp: Does someone from the platform team have time to look into this? It seems like the frontend / browser chrome is behaving correctly but we end up in a situation where the "attacker's site" overlays another website (Great for Clickjacking).
What I see from debugging this:
\* (Tab 1) We load the demo site and update the chrome accordingly
\* The first link opens a new tab (Tab 2) (target="\_blank") and injects some html+js with a 10 second timeout to load twitter and show an alert. We automatically switch to the new tab.
\* (Tab 1) Additionally the first link (via ontouchstart) starts a 1 second timeout that shows an alert. This alert, after 1 second, leads to us automatically selecting tab 1 again. [1]
\* (Tab 1) The second link sets the tab to fullscreen mode.
\* (Tab 2) The 10 second timeout will fire, show an alert, we automatically select tab 2 again [1], leave the fullscreen mode [2], and will load Twitter.
\* We end up on tab 2 (Twitter) but still see the content of tab 1. Clicks on the content will click elements on Twitter's page. The chrome however correctly shows that we are on Twitter and the tabs tray has the correct selections and even shows a Twitter thumbnail.
Note: For this to "work" you have to have the right timing and click "link 2" before the 10 second timeout in tab 2 fires. If you just wait 10 seconds after clicking link 1 then we switch to tab 2 (because of the alert) and just load twitter normally. Going to fullscreen mode first is important for this bug. We actually have code in place to exit fullscreen mode when switching tabs [2] but this doesn't seem to help here.

I think this exploit has been introduced with [bug 1161802](/show_bug.cgi?id=1161802 "RESOLVED FIXED - Put document in fullscreen state and trigger the event after sizemodechange"), which enables support for fullscreen transitions/fading.
This patch fixes the issue by finishing the DOM fullscreen change without delay.
I don't know whether this breaks fullscreen transitions or not, do we have tests for this?

Unconditionally doing this would certainly break the fullscreen transition. It would make the document change at the beginning of the transition.
Could you explain why the content of Tab 1 (the testcase page) is displayed over Tab 2 (the mobile twitter) if FinishDOMFullscreenChange is called asynchronously?

From what I can see, we fail because we set focus (nsFocusManager::SetFocus) before finishing the fullscreen change.
By finishing the DOM fullscreen change in sync, we make sure the fullscreen state is cleared first, before updating the focus. Otherwise, all Android-specific tab/content handling looks identical between the sync and async cases.
It's not clear to me, why preserving this sequence is important or how the focusing mechanics are supposed to work on Android with fullscreen transitions.

Apparently you cleared the needinfo immediately after setting it; sorry I didn't see this question. If you can reduce the testcase to something that could plausibly fool a user then we could raise the severity. I'm not optimistic that you can obscure the full-screen warning and prompt enough to make a user think everything is just fine and normal.

That would be a different PoC and possibly require an additional fix; please file as a separate bug.

I think we need to understand the details why this could happen. Does setting focus do anything about what would be displayed?
What FinishDOMFullscreenChange does when exiting fullscreen is basically just resetting the document state and queuing a fullscreenchange event to be dispatched in the next tick.
Having said that, probably it is because the refresh driver is unexpectedly activated by the queued event somehow? Could that be the case?

Attached patch

[0001-Bug-1222798-1.2-Update-tab-selection-after-fullscree.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8774441&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8774441&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1222798&attachment=8774441)

The behavior change (between the sync and async fullscreen change) in the focusing mechanics was triggered by changed frame visibility [1].
Reading the "sizemodechange" event handling on B2G, I think we need to adjust content visibility once the fullscreen transition has ended, but there is no such mechanic on Android afaik.
The way this is handled on Android is through the "Tab:Selected" event chain. We need to defer handling this event to the "fullscreenchange" handler, to make sure that the fullscreen transition has concluded.

I'm not familiar with the chrome js code on Android, but the logic looks reasonable.
I would consider this as a hacking fix. I think it would still be better to understand what really happens underneath, why the rendering could be out of sync with all other things.

As per summary. This also allows loading, say, about:preferences in an iframe on about:feeds or about:reader or whatever. Compartments save our butt from immediate pwnage, but I'm fairly sure that chrome-privileged things in non-toplevel documents is bad either way.
This is a regression (it wasn't possible in 47), probably from [bug 1253673](/show_bug.cgi?id=1253673 "RESOLVED FIXED - bypass FireFox Secure Connection Failed prompt to whitelist any site (but doesn't work)"). Not marking for now because we don't know for sure and I don't yet know exactly how bad this is. Just that it's bad.

Oh, to be clear: it was a regression for about:feeds, which wasn't unlinkable before that bug. I haven't checked how this affects/affected pages that were unlinkable before, like about:reader.

Even when about:feeds wasn't linkable, the meta redirect technique would still load it( I remember testing this in release when there was no other way for me to load content for about:feeds.)
Should that be a different bug if I can confirm that it does work before the regression seen here?

I'm not sure what "the meta redirect technique" means in this context. about:feeds is currently 'unlinkable', so if you try and do e.g. location.href = 'about:feeds' on the web, you get an error. That didn't use to be the case (pre-firefox-48).

Loading about:feeds in ff 47 which shows that even without this regression the possibility for this being used maliciously is very real.

This doesn't make a difference for this bug - this bug is about loading about:preferences or other privileged about: pages from unprivileged pages like about:feeds . It is orthogonal to whether or not you can load about:feeds, but it was likely regressed by the change in [bug 1253673](/show_bug.cgi?id=1253673 "RESOLVED FIXED - bypass FireFox Secure Connection Failed prompt to whitelist any site (but doesn't work)").
As I said in [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1309310#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Unlinkable content-privileged about: pages can link to chrome-privileged about: pages"), in 47 you could load about:feeds directly with a link or assigning to location.href . That is no longer possible. Your redirect works in 52 as well as 47, but that doesn't affect about:preferences . The problem is loading about:preferences \*from\* about:feeds .

I feel bad because it's my regression, but I think it would be good if there was someone else with cycles. If not, ping me again and I can try to find time for this.
Note that this might not be entirely trivial to fix...

Well, I haven't deep-dived on this yet, but there's basically 3 sets of pages here:
(a) about: pages with system principal (which we try always try to prevent the web from opening)
(b) about: pages without system principal that we try to prevent the web from opening (are "unlinkable")
(c) about: pages without system principal that can easily be opened by the web (e.g. about:blank)
(a) and now (b) are not nested URIs, they're just "about:foo". (c) \*are\* nested, they are about:foo on the outside, moz-safe-about:foo on the inside).
CAPS has flag checks on URIs where it basically checks whether one URI can open the other based on the flags set on the target URL (like "this URI is a UI resource" or "this URI should not be loaded by web content"). However, we purposefully don't do some of those flag checks when the source and target URI have the same scheme. This means chrome:// URLs can always link to other chrome:// URLs, http:// can always link to other http://, etc.
The nesting difference means that pages in category (c) can't open pages in (b) and (a), because their URI schemes are not the same (the outer scheme is the same (about), but one of them is nested and the other isn't, so we conclude the two URIs aren't scheme-equivalent).
The bug here is that I would argue that pages in (b) also shouldn't be able to open pages in (a).
I don't know for sure what would be the simplest way of adapting CAPS so this is no longer possible. The obvious options include manually special-casing about: URIs somehow, or adding a flag that we set on the about: protocol that we check for in the CAPS code in question, so that we don't allow loads based on scheme-equivalence for non-nested about: URIs. That last one sounds like the most plausible, much though I would hate to add yet another URI flag to nsIProtocolHandler. Boris, does that sound sane?
Note that as of right now, AFAIK there is no obvious way to exploit this. If there was a way to run script or create links in about:feeds, that would change.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Oh, also, this problem is just going to get worse once we de-nest about: URIs (which we should be doing at some point - [bug 1228118](/show_bug.cgi?id=1228118 "NEW - Change about: handling to not use nested URIs")).

I \*may\* try to implement this a little later today. My net access is limited and if I do get something together I'll dig up try server access and push the patch. Anyone else who may pick this up please do because I have very limited net access as of late and it's hard for me to get sufficient time to focus on work.

So something like this? Tested by adding a link to about:preferences on about:mozilla, clicking that gets me a security error.
I haven't pushed to try yet... not sure if that's worth it or if I should just land and hope things don't break, given that it's a sec bug. Although I realize this is a sec-moderate, I'm worried that we don't know the exact impact of this bug, and the impact of disclosure-by-patch. But maybe I'm overly paranoid?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Patch v0.1
One upshot here is that a not-publicly-linkable but not system privileged about: URI will no longer be able to link to \_itself\_, right? This might in fact cause some breakage. Maybe we should allow the link even if denySameSchemeLinks if currentURI and currentOtherURI are equalsIgnoringRef or something?
Past that, I'm not sure about try vs just landing; that's something worth checking with the sec-approval folks.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Itself, yes, I suppose so. I'm not sure any pages exists that actually need to be able to link to themselves... We could also potentially make only the system-privileged be non-same-scheme-linkable by modifying the flags per URI, which would avoid having to put this logic into caps. That said, that would then allow e.g. about:mozilla and about:reader to link to each other (neither is outside-linkable nor privileged). That might be OK given that neither is privileged - how would you feel about that?
> Maybe we should allow the link even if

Indeed, that would also make sense to me.

It doesn't seem completely unreasonable, but I think the equalsIgnoringRef suggestion allows fewer things and should be enough in practical terms.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Like this? This seems to wfm (tested by opening about:mozilla, and in the web console running location.href = 'about:mozilla', which failed on the previous patch, and succeeds with these changes).

I don't think there is, but you're right that having that break would be confusing.

Attached patch

[Patch for beta](attachment.cgi?id=8818531&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8818531&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1309310&attachment=8818531)

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [bug 1253673](/show_bug.cgi?id=1253673 "RESOLVED FIXED - bypass FireFox Secure Connection Failed prompt to whitelist any site (but doesn't work)")
[User impact if declined]: a failure in one of our defense-in-depth security mechanisms.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: by automated tests, yes, but not manually
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Maybe. Here's a quick in-product test that I just came up with (which verifies this is indeed fixed on aurora, and still busted on beta):
1. open about:mozilla
2. open the developer tools console (ctrl-shift-k on Windows/Linux)
3. paste in:
i = document.createElement("iframe"); i.src = "about:preferences"; document.body.appendChild(i);
4. execute that code
Expected: the iframe (rectangle) that gets added at the bottom of the page is empty-ish
Actual: the iframe loads the Firefox preferences page.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: this patch includes the fix for [bug 1318664](/show_bug.cgi?id=1318664 "RESOLVED FIXED - Security Error: Content at about:cache may not load or link to about:cache?storage=disk&context="), which was a regression caused by this patch. (Note for people using this: this is a patch file against beta containing 2 separate csets that was generated by using 'hg export' with multiple revs. "hg import" should be able to cope.)
[Is the change risky?]: not very.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: there are pretty thorough tests, we found and fixed the 1 regression this caused (and expanded the test coverage to ensure we don't break that code again) and no other regressions have been reported (that I'm aware of) in the 4 weeks that this has now been present on trunk + aurora.
