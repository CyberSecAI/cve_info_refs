Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of content-privileged `about:` pages (which are intended to be restricted) to load chrome-privileged `about:` pages within iframes. This occurs because the browser's Content Security Policy (CSP) checks were not correctly preventing these types of cross-origin loads within the `about:` scheme. Specifically, the same-scheme check in the browser's capability system (CAPS) was not considering the differences between nested and non-nested `about:` URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Content-privileged `about:` pages (like `about:feeds` or `about:reader`) could load privileged `about:` pages (like `about:preferences`), effectively granting the less privileged pages access to the functionality and permissions of the privileged ones.
*   **Iframe Loading:** The vulnerability is triggered by loading privileged `about:` pages within iframes embedded in content-privileged `about:` pages.
*   **Bypassed Security Mechanisms:** The vulnerability bypassed intended restrictions in the browser's security model, which should have prevented this type of access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially exploit the ability to load chrome-privileged `about:` pages in iframes to gain access to sensitive user information or to execute privileged code within the browser.
*  Though the compartments prevent immediate compromise, the vulnerability undermines security by allowing privileged and unprivileged content to interact when they shouldn't.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to find a way to control content within a content-privileged `about:` page, like `about:feeds`, and cause it to load a chrome-privileged `about:` page, like `about:preferences`, in an iframe. The provided test case uses javascript to create the iframe, but other attack vectors are possible
*   The attack relies on loading an iframe with a chrome privileged `about:` page from a content privileged `about:` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the content of a content-privileged `about:` page or find a method to inject content into it.
*   No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to control the content loaded in such `about:` pages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was a regression introduced in Firefox 48 due to changes in how `about:` URIs were handled.
*   The fix involved adding a new flag to the protocol handler and modifying the CAPS code to skip the "allow same-protocol links" if the flag is set, in effect, disallowing linking between non-nested `about:` pages and chrome privileged `about:` pages.
*   The bug report also notes that a similar issue was present prior to the regression, however that original issue was with how the content privileged page (`about:feeds`) was loaded and was not the primary cause of this specific vulnerability.

This detailed information should give a good understanding of the nature and severity of CVE-2017-5391.
