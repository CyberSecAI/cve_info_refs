{
  "CVE-2017-5467": {
    "Description": "A potential memory corruption and crash when using Skia content when drawing content outside of the bounds of a clipping region.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Skia handles bounds clipping during drawing operations. When content is drawn outside of a defined clipping region, a memory corruption issue occurs, which can lead to a crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exploitation could lead to a crash, potentially exploitable.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious web content",
       "Specifically crafted SVG content"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to display content using the Skia library and influence the drawing operations to occur outside of a clipping region."
