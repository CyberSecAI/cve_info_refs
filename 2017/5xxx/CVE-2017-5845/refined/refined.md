Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-5845:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an invalid memory read within the `gst_avi_demux_parse_ncdt` function of the `gst-plugins-good` library in GStreamer. Specifically, the code attempts to read data at an address that is either invalid or out of bounds during the parsing of AVI files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Invalid memory read:** The primary vulnerability is the attempt to read memory at an invalid address, which is triggered by malformed AVI data. This indicates a lack of proper bounds checking or input validation within the `gst_avi_demux_parse_ncdt` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a crash of applications using the vulnerable GStreamer code due to the invalid memory read. This leads to a denial-of-service condition. The content does not indicate a more severe impact such as arbitrary code execution from this specific vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious AVI File:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted AVI file that contains malformed or unexpected data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide or entice a user or system into processing the malicious AVI file through an application using the vulnerable GStreamer plugins.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2017:2060) confirms that this vulnerability affects multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.
*   The fix for this issue is included in `gstreamer1-plugins-good 1.10.3`.
*   The upstream fix was located in this commit: <https://github.com/GStreamer/gst-plugins-good/commit/4f47835>
*   The bug was first discovered and reported upstream: <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777532>
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) AVI file exists that demonstrates the vulnerability.
*   Red Hat rated this as a Moderate severity issue.
*   This CVE is one of multiple issues that were fixed in GStreamer 1.10.3.

In summary, CVE-2017-5845 is caused by an invalid memory access during parsing of specific crafted AVI files, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition by crashing the application.
