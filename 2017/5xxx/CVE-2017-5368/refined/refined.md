**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ZoneMinder web application lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Absence of CSRF tokens or any other mechanism to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge or consent.

- The malicious page includes a form that sends a crafted request to ZoneMinder's server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in ZoneMinder user into loading the malicious HTML page, usually via a link, email or similar methods.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the ZoneMinder application; instead, they rely on the user's existing session.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates how to silently add a new administrative user using a hidden iframe and a form.
- The form contains the necessary POST parameters to create a new user.
- The form is automatically submitted via javascript once the page loads.
