Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5447:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read during the processing of glyph widths during text layout. Specifically, when a text run (a sequence of characters with a common style) is being laid out, the code attempts to read glyph width information, and in some cases, the read goes beyond the boundaries of the allocated memory for glyph data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the program attempts to access a memory location that is outside the bounds of a defined buffer, leading to potential access of unintended memory.
*   **Improper Text Layout:** The root cause is tied to how glyph widths are handled during text layout calculations, suggesting an issue in the text layout engine when processing specific content.
*   **Stale Textruns**: Textruns that no longer correspond to the frames with which they're associated contribute to the vulnerability. This results in incorrect buffer mapping and OOB access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Potentially Exploitable Crash:**  The vulnerability can cause a crash, which may be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. The content notes that it is a "potentially exploitable crash."
*  **Memory Disclosure:**  An attacker could use the out-of-bounds read to read arbitrary memory, which can be used to bypass security mechanism like ASLR and achieve information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Content:** The primary attack vector is through the delivery of malicious web content. Specifically, HTML pages with specific CSS style configurations and  certain character sequences can trigger the vulnerability during layout process.
*   **HTTP/2 DATA Frames**: HTTP/2 responses with DATA frames that have incorrect padding length will trigger this bug.
*   **Maliciously Crafted Fonts**: Incorrect glyph processing is involved during text layout. Maliciously crafted fonts might lead to this issue as well.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by hosting malicious web pages or through delivery of malformed HTTP/2 responses.
*  **User Interaction:** Some of the descriptions mentioned that resizing browser windows or scrolling can trigger the vulnerability. These suggest that the attacker may need the user to perform certain actions for successful exploitation.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the program attempts to access a memory location outside the allocated space, causing a read beyond the bounds of a buffer during glyph processing.
*   The `gfxTextRun` component is involved, which is part of the text layout and rendering mechanism in Firefox.
*   The issue can be triggered when certain conditions related to `white-space`, `float`, and bidirectional text are met in the HTML content being rendered by a browser.
*   Patches involved updating the cached value of frame text length, and adding a runtime check for out-of-bounds access.
* Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2017:1104, RHSA-2017:1106, and RHSA-2017:1201 mention this CVE.

In summary, CVE-2017-5447 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Firefox triggered during text layout, making it exploitable via malicious web content. The impact is a potentially exploitable crash and/or information disclosure through the reading of potentially sensitive information.
