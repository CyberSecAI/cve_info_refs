#### Dependencies

Apache Flex Blaze DS requires some build tools which must be installed prior to building BlazeDS.

#### General Requirements

* Java SDK 1.8 or greater
* Maven 2.2.0 or greater

#### Verify the integrity of the files

Apache relies on 3rd party mirrors to distribute their software. Because these releases are hosted on servers that are not under our control, we strongly recommend that you verify the integrity of the binaries or source code before you install it using the PGP or MD5 signatures listed next to the downloads. This involves a few extra steps, but it will verify that you are getting a true Apache release.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the [KEYS](https://www.apache.org/dist/flex/KEYS) as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Make sure you get these files as linked from this page (rather than a mirror) to insure the integrity of the files.

```
% pgpk -a KEYS

% pgpv blazeds-4.8.0-source-release.tar.gz.asc

```

*or*

```
% pgp -ka KEYS

% pgp blazeds-4.8.0-source-release.tar.gz.asc

```

*or*

```
% gpg --import KEYS

% gpg --verify blazeds-4.8.0-source-release.tar.gz.asc

```

Alternatively, you can verify the SHA512 signature on the files. A unix/Mac program called `shasum` or `sha512sum` is included in many unix distributions. It is also available as part of [GNU Textutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html). Windows users can get binary md5 programs from [here](https://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/) , [here](https://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/) , or [here](https://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/). An MD5 signature consists of 32 hex characters, and a SHA1 signature consists of 40 hex characters. Ensure your generated signature string matches the signature string published in the files above.

#### Description

The AMF deserialization implementation of Flex BlazeDS is vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data via Externalizable.readExternal(ObjectInput).

By sending a specially crafted AMF message, it is possible to make the server establish a connection to an endpoint specified in the message and request an RMI remote object from that endpoint. This can result in the execution of arbitrary code on the server via Java deserialization.

## Action Message Format (AMF3) Java implementations are vulnerable to insecure deserialization and XML external entities references

#### Vulnerability Note VU#307983

Original Release Date: 2017-04-04 | Last Revised: 2017-04-14

---

### Overview

Several Java implementations of AMF3 are vulnerable to insecure deserialization and XML external entities references.

### Description

| Several Java implementations of Action Message Format (AMF3) are vulnerable to one or more of the following implementation errors:  [**CWE-502**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**Some Java implementations of AMF3 deserializers derive class instances from java.io.Externalizable rather than the [AMF3 specification](http://www.adobe.com/go/amfspec)'s recommendation of flash.utils.IExternalizable. A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control an RMI server connection may be able to send serialized Java objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized.The reporter has identified the following products and versions as being affected, and CVE ID have been assigned as follows:- Atlassian JIRA, versions from 4.2.4 prior to version 6.3.0 - CVE-2017-5983- Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel, version 2.2.0 - CVE-2017-3201- GraniteDS, version 3.1.1.GA - CVE-2017-3199- Pivotal/Spring spring-flex - CVE-2017-3203- WebORB for Java by Midnight Coders, version 5.1.1.0 - CVE-2017-3207Products using these libraries may also be impacted.[**CWE-913**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/913.html)**: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources**Some Java implementations of AMF3 deserializers may allow instantiation of arbitrary classes via their public parameter-less constructor and subsequently call arbitrary Java Beans setter methods. The ability to exploit this vulnerability depends on the availability of classes in the class path that make use of deserialization. A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control information may be able to send serialized Java objects with pre-set properties that result in arbitrary code execution when deserialized.The reporter has identified the following products and versions as being affected, and CVE ID have been assigned as follows:- Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel, version 2.2.0 - CVE-2017-3202- Flex BlazeDS , versions 4.6.0.23207 and 4.7.2 - CVE-2017-5641- GraniteDS, version 3.1.1.GA - CVE-2017-3200Products using these libraries may also be impacted.[**CWE-611**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)**: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')**Some Java implementations of AMF3 deserializers allow external entity references (XXEs) from XML documents embedded within AMF3 messages. If the XML parsing is handled incorrectly it could potentially expose sensitive data on the server, denial of service, or server side request forgery. - Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel, version 2.2.0 - CVE-2017-3206- Flex BlazeDS , version 4.6.0.23207 - CVE-2015-3269- GraniteDS, version 3.1.1.GA - CVE-2016-2340 (see [VU#279472](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/279472))- WebORB for Java by Midnight Coders, version 5.1.1.0 - CVE-2017-3208Products using these libraries may also be impacted.More information is provided in the researcher's [advisory](http://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2017/04/amf.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control a server connection may be able to send serialized Java objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update if available**CERT/CC recommends applying an update or patch to your product if available. Some vendors have responded that only out-of-support versions of products are impacted. In these cases, CERT/CC recommends updating your product to the latest supported version.More details are included for each vendor in the vendor records below. |
| --- |

| **Developers should use an updated JDK**Developers should use an updated Java development kit (JDK). JDK 8 update 121, JDK 7 update 131 and JDK 6 update 141 implement basic serialization blacklisting filters, while more serialization protection measures are expected in the upcoming Java 9. For more information, please see [JEP 290](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290).**Developers should be suspicious of deserialized data from untrusted sources**Developers should in general be very suspicious of deserialized data from an untrusted source. For best practices, see the [CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27492407) guidelines for Serialization, especially rules [SER12-J](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/SER12-J.%2BPrevent%2Bdeserialization%2Bof%2Buntrusted%2Bclasses) and [SER13-J](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/SER13-J.%2BTreat%2Bdata%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bdeserialized%2Bas%2Bpotentially%2Bmalicious%2Bby%2Bdefault).**Use firewall rules or filesystem restrictions**System administrators may be able to mitigate this issue for some applications by restricting access to the network and/or filesystem. If an affected application utilizes an open port accepting serialized objects, restricting access to the application may help mitigate the issue. |

### [Midnight Coders](#BLUU-AKHTCK) Unknown

Notified:  March 16, 2017  Updated: April 03, 2017

**Statement Date:   March 16, 2017**

### Status

Unknown

### Vendor Statement

The demonstrated code would not be able to be able to cause any harm for the reason that calling setAutoCommit( true ) requires a connection object which is not even initialized at that time (see lines 4067-4087 at: <http://www.docjar.com/html/api/com/sun/rowset/JdbcRowSetImpl.java.html>).

Additionally, in our implementation all com.sun.\* and java.\* classes are excluded from deserialization.
