Sawmill Enterprise v8.7.9

sawmill8.7.9.4_x86_windows.exe
hash: b7ec7bc98c42c4908dfc50450b4521d0

Sawmill is a powerful heirarchical log analysis tool that runs on every
major platform.

Vulnerability Type:
===================================
Pass the Hash Authentication Bypass

CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-5496

Security Issue:
=====================
Sawmill suffers from a classic "Pass The Hash" vulnerability whereby an
attacker who gains access to the hashed user account passwords
can login to the Sawmill interface using the raw MD5 hash values, allowing
attackers to bypass the work of offline cracking
account password hashes.

This issue usually is known to affect Windows systems e.g. (NT Pass the
Hash/Securityfocus, 1997). However, this vulnerability can also
present itself in a vulnerable Web application.

Sawmill account password hashes are stored under LogAnalysisInfo/ directory
in "users.cfg".

e.g.

users = {
  root_admin = {
    username = "admin"
    password_checksum = "e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03"
    email_address = ""

This config file is stored local to the Sawmill application. However, if an
attacker gains access to a backup of the config that is
stored in some other location that is then compromised, it can lead to
subversion of Sawmills authenticaton process.

Moreover, since 'users.cfg' file is world readble a regular non Admin
Windows user who logs into the system running sawmill can now grab
a password hash and easily login to the vulnerable application without the
needing the password itself.

How to test?

Sawmill running (default port 8988), log off Windows and switch to a
"Standard" Windows non Administrator user.

1) Open "users.cfg" under Sawmills directory "C:\Program Files\Sawmill 8\LogAnalysisInfo" and copy the root_admin Admin password hash.

2) Go to the Sawmill login page in web browser http://VICTIM-IP:8988/ enter username 'admin' and the hash, Tada! your Admin.

Finally, Sawmill passwords are hashed using vulnerable MD5 algorithm and no
salt.

e.g.

password: abc123
MD5 hash:
e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Vendor:
===============
www.sawmill.net
Product:
========================
Sawmill Enterprise v8.7.9
sawmill8.7.9.4\_x86\_windows.exe
hash: b7ec7bc98c42c4908dfc50450b4521d0
Sawmill is a powerful heirarchical log analysis tool that runs on every major platform.
Vulnerability Type:
===================================
Pass the Hash Authentication Bypass
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-5496
Security Issue:
=====================
Sawmill suffers from a classic "Pass The Hash" vulnerability whereby an attacker who gains access to the hashed user account passwords
can login to the Sawmill interface using the raw MD5 hash values, allowing attackers to bypass the work of offline cracking
account password hashes.
This issue usually is known to affect Windows systems e.g. (NT Pass the Hash/Securityfocus, 1997). However, this vulnerability can also
present itself in a vulnerable Web application.
Sawmill account password hashes are stored under LogAnalysisInfo/ directory in "users.cfg".
e.g.
users = {
root\_admin = {
username = "admin"
password\_checksum = "e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03"
email\_address = ""
This config file is stored local to the Sawmill application. However, if an attacker gains access to a backup of the config that is
stored in some other location that is then compromised, it can lead to subversion of Sawmills authenticaton process.
Moreover, since 'users.cfg' file is world readble a regular non Admin Windows user who logs into the system running sawmill can now grab
a password hash and easily login to the vulnerable application without the needing the password itself.
How to test?
Sawmill running (default port 8988), log off Windows and switch to a "Standard" Windows non Administrator user.
1) Open "users.cfg" under Sawmills directory "C:\Program Files\Sawmill 8\LogAnalysisInfo" and copy the root\_admin Admin password hash.
2) Go to the Sawmill login page in web browser http://VICTIM-IP:8988/ enter username 'admin' and the hash, Tada! your Admin.
Finally, Sawmill passwords are hashed using vulnerable MD5 algorithm and no salt.
e.g.
password: abc123
MD5 hash:
e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03
