Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application stores user passwords using unsalted MD5 hashing.
*   The application allows authentication using the raw MD5 hash of the password, instead of the password itself. This is a "Pass the Hash" vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Password Storage:**  Passwords are hashed using MD5 without salt, which is a weak and easily crackable hashing algorithm.
*   **Pass the Hash Vulnerability:** The application accepts the MD5 hash of a password directly as a valid authentication credential, bypassing the need to crack the hash and obtain the original password.
*  **World Readable Configuration File:** The `users.cfg` file containing the password hashes is world-readable on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who obtains a user's password hash can directly log into the Sawmill application with that user's privileges, including administrative access.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Access to the `users.cfg` file allows an attacker to obtain password hashes for all users.
*   **Authentication Bypass**: An attacker can bypass the normal authentication process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A non-administrator user on the same system can read the world-readable `users.cfg` file and obtain password hashes to escalate privileges.
*  **Remote Access:** An attacker who compromises a backup of the config file can use the hashes.
*   **Network Access**: The application's default port 8988 is exposed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to obtain access to the `users.cfg` file. This can be achieved through:
    *   Local access to the server where Sawmill is running.
    *   Compromising a backup location where the `users.cfg` might be stored.
*   The attacker needs to know the default port (8988) where Sawmill is running.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Sawmill Enterprise v8.7.9.
*   The exploit is a classic "Pass the Hash" vulnerability, often seen in Windows environments but also present in this web application.
*   The provided content includes details about how to test and reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The content mentions that the vendor was notified and assigned CVE-2017-5496, but a fix was not immediately available.
