Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-5832:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability Name:** Persistent XSS
*   **CWE ID:** CWE-79
*   **CVSSv3 Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C
*   **CVSSv3 Base Score:** 4.2
*  **CVSSv3 Temporal Score:** 3.7
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data in their email address. Specifically, an authenticated user could set their own email address to a specifically crafted string which was then displayed without proper escaping in the context of other users (e.g. the administrator user).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially steal a session with elevated privileges (e.g. the administrator's session). This would grant them unauthorized access and control over the application, leading to actions such as data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious string in their email address which includes JavaScript code.
    *   When other users (such as an administrator) view information about the attacker, this malicious code is executed in their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Revive Adserver application. They don't need special privileges but need to have an account. The attacker needs to be able to modify their profile's email address.
*   **More Information:** The report was made by HackerOne user pavanw3b.
