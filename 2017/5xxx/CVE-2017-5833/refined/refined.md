The provided content relates to CVE-2017-5833.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper escaping of parameters used in the invocation code generation for interstitial zones.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page. If a user clicks on a crafted link containing the malicious script, the script will be executed in the context of their browser session. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user, redirect to malicious sites etc.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed by crafting malicious URLs with specific parameters used in the invocation code generation for interstitial zones.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to convince a user to click on the crafted URL, either by tricking them via social engineering or other means (e.g. through an XSS vulnerability on a related website). The attacker does not need to be authenticated to execute the attack, however, they do require the user to click on their link.
