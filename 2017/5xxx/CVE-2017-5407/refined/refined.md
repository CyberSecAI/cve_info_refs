  "CVE-2017-5407": {
    "description": "Using SVG filters that don't use the fixed point math implementation on a target iframe, a malicious page can extract pixel values from a targeted user. This can be used to extract history information and read text values across domains. This violates same-origin policy and leads to information disclosure.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of floating-point math in SVG filter implementations. Specifically, the `feSpecularLighting` filter with a subnormal surfaceScale value causes differences in rendering time depending on the input's alpha channel. This timing difference allows for extracting pixel data from a targeted iframe.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of floating-point math in performance-critical SVG filters.",
      "Lack of proper same-origin policy enforcement when processing SVG filters on cross-origin iframes.",
      "Timing side channel vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious page can extract pixel values from a targeted user and can be used to extract history information and read text values across domains. This violates the same-origin policy and leads to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious page containing an SVG filter that targets a victim's website loaded in an iframe. This page leverages the timing difference to infer pixel data from the target iframe.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create and host a malicious webpage, and entice a user to visit this webpage. The victim should also have a vulnerable version of Firefox or Thunderbird.",
