The provided content is a blog post detailing multiple mobile applications vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks due to improper TLS certificate validation. CVE-2017-5916 is specifically mentioned in relation to the "America’s First FCU Mobile Banking" application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper or disabled TLS certificate validation in the mobile application. This allows the app to accept invalid or self-signed certificates from an attacker, instead of verifying the authenticity of the server it is communicating with.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper TLS certificate validation.
- The application transmits sensitive data (username and password) over an insecure connection when a MITM attack is in place.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept and steal sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, transmitted by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts and manipulate data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:
    - Attackers within Wi-Fi range.
    - Attackers in a privileged network position.
    - Attackers who control a device on the same network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the mobile device and the server.
- This could be achieved by being on the same Wi-Fi network, having control of a network device, or having a privileged position within the network.
- The attacker also needs to be able to generate a fake TLS certificate for the target server.

**Specific details for CVE-2017-5916:**
- Application: “America’s First FCU Mobile Banking” by America’s First Federal Credit Union
- Vulnerable version: 3.1.0
- Vulnerable server: command.onlinebank.com
- Data exposed: username and password
- Status: not yet fixed as of the post date
