  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "ZooKeeper didn't restrict access to the computationally expensive wchp/wchc commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of service vulnerability due to unrestricted access to computationally intensive commands."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause denial of service by abusing wchp/wchc commands, leading to elevated CPU consumption and the server being unable to serve legitimate requests.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Abuse of wchp/wchc commands via the ZooKeeper client port (typically 2181)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the ZooKeeper client port."
  },
  "additional_details": {
     "mitigation": "The vulnerability is mitigated by disabling the wchp/wchc commands by default.  A new configuration option, '4lw.commands.whitelist', was introduced allowing commands to be selectively whitelisted, and the full set of commands can be restored with '*'.  Firewall the ZooKeeper service and only allow access to trusted applications.",
