### Intel® Product Security Announcements

Intel is focused on ensuring the security of our customers computing environments. We are committed to rapidly addressing issues as they arise, and providing recommendations through security advisories and security [announcements](/content/www/us/en/security-center/announcement/default.html).

### Report a Vulnerability

If you have information about a security issue or vulnerability with an **Intel branded product or technology**, please send an e-mail to secure@intel.com. Encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP public key](/content/www/us/en/security-center/pgp-public-key.html).

Please provide as much information as possible, including:

* The products and versions affected
* Detailed description of the vulnerability
* Information on known exploits

A member of the Intel Product Security Team will review your e-mail and contact you to collaborate on resolving the issue. For more information on how Intel works to resolve security issues, see:

* [Vulnerability handling guidelines](/content/www/us/en/security-center/vulnerability-handling-guidelines.html)

For issues related to Intel's external web presence (Intel.com and related subdomains), please contact Intel's External Security Research team.

### Intel® Bug Bounty Program

Intel Corporation believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is a crucial part of identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in Intel products. Like other major technology companies, Intel incentivizes security researchers to report security vulnerabilities in Intel products to us to enable a coordinated response. To encourage closer collaboration with the security research community on these kinds of issues, Intel created its Bug Bounty Program. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in an Intel product or technology, we encourage you to notify us through our program and work with us to mitigate and to coordinate disclosure of the vulnerability.

Watch this video, [So You Found a Vulnerability](/content/www/us/en/security-center/so-you-found-a-vulnerability.html), to find out what you can expect when participating in the Intel® Bug Bounty Program.

### Intel Security Vulnerability Researcher Community Code of Conduct

The [Code of Conduct](/content/www/us/en/security-center/Code_of_Conduct.html) applies to all interactions among persons reporting or discussing security issues with Intel employees (‘Community Members’). It outlines the expected/acceptable standards of behavior, classifies some unacceptable behaviors, and describes possible enforcement actions for the Community Member interactions if unacceptable behavior arises during crowdsourced security vulnerability research such as the Intel® Bug Bounty Program, Project Circuit Breaker, vulnerability reporting, or any other communications interactions such as slack channels, email communication, or in person communications.
