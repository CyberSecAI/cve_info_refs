{
  "CVE-2017-5550": {
    "Root cause": "A fencepost error in the `pipe_advance()` function within the Linux kernel.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Heap information leak. The logic in `pipe_advance()` failed to release buffers correctly when the number of buffers to release was equal to `pipe->buffers`, leaving the pipe full of uninitialized pages.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leak kernel heap memory by triggering the vulnerability. This leaked information may be used to facilitate further attacks or privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through specific pipe operations that result in filling the pipe with uninitialized pages.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to perform pipe operations that trigger the described condition. This could involve a local user with sufficient privileges or a more complex attack vector depending on the specific use case.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is present in the `pipe_advance()` function in `lib/iov_iter.c`. The patch modifies the `pipe_advance()` and introduces the `pipe_truncate()` function to properly handle buffer releases, thus preventing the information leak."
