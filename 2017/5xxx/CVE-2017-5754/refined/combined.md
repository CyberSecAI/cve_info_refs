# Synology-SA-18:01 Meltdown and Spectre Attacks

Publish Time: 2018-01-04 13:36:12 UTC+8

Last Updated: 2020-02-21 21:16:20 UTC+8

Severity
Moderate

Status
Resolved

**Abstract**

These vulnerabilities allow local users to obtain sensitive information via a susceptible version of Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM), Synology Router Manager (SRM), and VisualStation running on an Intel or Arm CPU, even if in Virtual Machine Manager.

Synology rates the overall severity as Moderate because these vulnerabilities can only be exploited via local malicious programs. To secure customers' products against the attacks, we recommend you only install trusted packages.

Regarding [Spectre & Meltdown Checker](https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker), Synology implements `array_index_mask_nospec`, minimal ASM retpoline, Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI) into affected models [1], and additional Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier (IBPB) into specific models [2] to mitigate the vulnerabilities for DSM.

Our customers can mitigate the vulnerabilities in both DSM and SRM by upgrading to 6.2.2-24922 and 1.1.7-6941-1, respectively.

Abstract—Modern processors use branch prediction and spec-
ulative execution to maximize performance. For example, if the
destination of a branch depends on a memory value that is in the
process of being read, CPUs will try to guess the destination and
attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value ﬁnally arrives,
the CPU either discards or commits the speculative computation.
Speculative logic is unfaithful in how it executes, can access the
victim’s memory and registers, and can perform operations with
measurable side effects.

Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively
perform operations that would not occur during correct program
execution and which leak the victim’s conﬁdential information via
a side channel to the adversary. This paper describes practical
attacks that combine methodology from side channel attacks,
fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read
arbitrary memory from the victim’s process. More broadly, the
paper shows that speculative execution implementations violate
the security assumptions underpinning numerous software secu-
rity mechanisms, including operating system process separation,
containerization, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and countermea-
sures to cache timing and side-channel attacks. These attacks
represent a serious threat to actual systems since vulnerable
speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors
from Intel, AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices.
While makeshift processor-speciﬁc countermeasures are possi-
ble in some cases, sound solutions will require ﬁxes to processor
designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs)
to give hardware architects and software developers a common
understanding as to what computation state CPU implementa-
tions are (and are not) permitted to leak.

I. INTRODUCTION

Computations performed by physical devices often leave
observable side effects beyond the computation’s nominal
outputs. Side-channel attacks focus on exploiting these side
effects to extract otherwise-unavailable secret
information.
Since their introduction in the late 90’s [43], many physical
effects such as power consumption [41, 42], electromagnetic
radiation [58], or acoustic noise [20] have been leveraged to
extract cryptographic keys as well as other secrets.

Physical side-channel attacks can also be used to extract
secret information from complex devices such as PCs and
mobile phones [21, 22]. However, because these devices
often execute code from a potentially unknown origin, they
face additional threats in the form of software-based attacks,
which do not require external measurement equipment. While
some attacks exploit software vulnerabilities (such as buffer
overﬂows [5] or double-free errors [12]), other software attacks

leverage hardware vulnerabilities to leak sensitive information.
Attacks of the latter type include microarchitectural attacks
exploiting cache timing [8, 30, 48, 52, 55, 69, 74], branch
prediction history [1, 2], branch target buffers [14, 44] or open
DRAM rows [56]. Software-based techniques have also been
used to mount fault attacks that alter physical memory [39] or
internal CPU values [65].

Several microarchitectural design techniques have facilitated
the increase in processor speed over the past decades. One such
advancement is speculative execution, which is widely used
to increase performance and involves having the CPU guess
likely future execution directions and prematurely execute
instructions on these paths. More speciﬁcally, consider an
example where the program’s control ﬂow depends on an
uncached value located in external physical memory. As this
memory is much slower than the CPU, it often takes several
hundred clock cycles before the value becomes known. Rather
than wasting these cycles by idling, the CPU attempts to guess
the direction of control ﬂow, saves a checkpoint of its register
state, and proceeds to speculatively execute the program on the
guessed path. When the value eventually arrives from memory,
the CPU checks the correctness of its initial guess. If the
guess was wrong, the CPU discards the incorrect speculative
execution by reverting the register state back to the stored
checkpoint, resulting in performance comparable to idling.
However, if the guess was correct, the speculative execution
results are committed, yielding a signiﬁcant performance gain
as useful work was accomplished during the delay.

From a security perspective, speculative execution involves
executing a program in possibly incorrect ways. However,
because CPUs are designed to maintain functional correctness
by reverting the results of incorrect speculative executions to
their prior states, these errors were previously assumed to be
safe.

A. Our Results

In this paper, we analyze the security implications of such
incorrect speculative execution. We present a class of microar-
chitectural attacks which we call Spectre attacks. At a high
level, Spectre attacks trick the processor into speculatively
executing instruction sequences that should not have been
executed under correct program execution. As the effects of
these instructions on the nominal CPU state are eventually

reverted, we call them transient instructions. By inﬂuencing
which transient instructions are speculatively executed, we are
able to leak information from within the victim’s memory
address space.

We empirically demonstrate the feasibility of Spectre attacks
by exploiting transient instruction sequences to leak informa-
tion across security domains both from unprivileged native
code, as well as from portable JavaScript code.
Attacks using Native Code. As a proof-of-concept, we
create a simple victim program that contains secret data within
its memory address space. Next, we search the compiled
victim binary and the operating system’s shared libraries for
instruction sequences that can be used to leak information
from the victim’s address space. Finally, we write an attacker
program that exploits the CPU’s speculative execution feature
to execute the previously-found sequences as transient instruc-
tions. Using this technique, we are able to read memory from
the victim’s address space, including the secrets stored within
it.
Attacks using JavaScript and eBPF.
In addition to violating
process isolation boundaries using native code, Spectre attacks
can also be used to violate sandboxing, e.g., by mounting
them via portable JavaScript code. Empirically demonstrating
this, we show a JavaScript program that successfully reads
data from the address space of the browser process running
it. In addition, we demonstrate attacks leveraging the eBPF
interpreter and JIT in Linux.

B. Our Techniques

At a high level, Spectre attacks violate memory isola-
tion boundaries by combining speculative execution with
data exﬁltration via microarchitectural covert channels. More
speciﬁcally, to mount a Spectre attack, an attacker starts by
locating or introducing a sequence of instructions within the
process address space which, when executed, acts as a covert
channel transmitter that leaks the victim’s memory or register
contents. The attacker then tricks the CPU into speculatively
and erroneously executing this instruction sequence, thereby
leaking the victim’s information over the covert channel.
Finally, the attacker retrieves the victim’s information over
the covert channel. While the changes to the nominal CPU
state resulting from this erroneous speculative execution are
eventually reverted, previously leaked information or changes
to other microarchitectural states of the CPU, e.g., cache
contents, can survive nominal state reversion.

The above description of Spectre attacks is general, and
needs to be concretely instantiated with a way to induce
erroneous speculative execution as well as with a microar-
chitectural covert channel. While many choices are possible
for the covert channel component, the implementations de-
scribed in this work use cache-based covert channels [64],
i.e., Flush+Reload [74] and Evict+Reload [25, 45].

We now proceed to describe our techniques for inducing

and inﬂuencing erroneous speculative execution.
Variant 1: Exploiting Conditional Branches.
In this variant
of Spectre attacks, the attacker mistrains the CPU’s branch

predictor into mispredicting the direction of a branch, causing
the CPU to temporarily violate program semantics by execut-
ing code that would not have been executed otherwise. As we
show, this incorrect speculative execution allows an attacker to
read secret information stored in the program’s address space.
Indeed, consider the following code example:

if (x < array1_size)

y = array2[array1[x] * 4096];

In the example above, assume that the variable x contains
attacker-controlled data. To ensure the validity of the memory
access to array1, the above code contains an if statement
whose purpose is to verify that the value of x is within a
legal range. We show how an attacker can bypass this if
statement, thereby reading potentially secret data from the
process’s address space.

that

First, during an initial mistraining phase, the attacker in-
thereby training
vokes the above code with valid inputs,
the if will be true.
the branch predictor to expect
the attacker invokes the
Next, during the exploit phase,
code with a value of x outside the bounds of array1.
Rather than waiting for determination of the branch re-
sult, the CPU guesses that the bounds check will be true
and already speculatively executes instructions that evaluate
array2[array1[x]*4096] using the malicious x. Note
that the read from array2 loads data into the cache at an
address that is dependent on array1[x] using the malicious
x, scaled so that accesses go to different cache lines and to
avoid hardware prefetching effects.

When the result of the bounds check is eventually de-
termined,
the CPU discovers its error and reverts any
changes made to its nominal microarchitectural state. How-
ever, changes made to the cache state are not reverted, so the
attacker can analyze the cache contents and ﬁnd the value of
the potentially secret byte retrieved in the out-of-bounds read
from the victim’s memory.
Variant 2: Exploiting Indirect Branches. Drawing from
return-oriented programming (ROP) [63], in this variant the
attacker chooses a gadget from the victim’s address space
and inﬂuences the victim to speculatively execute the gadget.
Unlike ROP, the attacker does not rely on a vulnerability in
the victim code. Instead, the attacker trains the Branch Target
Buffer (BTB) to mispredict a branch from an indirect branch
instruction to the address of the gadget, resulting in speculative
execution of the gadget. As before, while the effects of
incorrect speculative execution on the CPU’s nominal state are
eventually reverted, their effects on the cache are not, thereby
allowing the gadget to leak sensitive information via a cache
side channel. We empirically demonstrate this, and show how
careful gadget selection allows this method to read arbitrary
memory from the victim.

To mistrain the BTB, the attacker ﬁnds the virtual address
of the gadget in the victim’s address space, then performs
indirect branches to this address. This training is done from
the attacker’s address space. It does not matter what resides at
the gadget address in the attacker’s address space; all that is

required is that the attacker’s virtual addresses during training
match (or alias to) those of the victim. In fact, as long as the
attacker handles exceptions, the attack can work even if there
is no code mapped at the virtual address of the gadget in the
attacker’s address space.

Other Variants. Further attacks can be designed by vary-
ing both the method of achieving speculative execution and
the method used to leak the information. Examples include
mistraining return instructions, leaking information via timing
variations, and contention on arithmetic units.

C. Targeted Hardware and Current Status

Hardware. We have empirically veriﬁed the vulnerabil-
ity of several Intel processors to Spectre attacks, including
Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake
processors. We have also veriﬁed the attack’s applicability
to AMD Ryzen CPUs. Finally, we have also successfully
mounted Spectre attacks on several ARM-based Samsung and
Qualcomm processors found in popular mobile phones.

Current Status. Using the practice of responsible disclosure,
disjoint groups of authors of this paper provided preliminary
versions of our results to partially overlapping groups of CPU
vendors and other affected companies. In coordination with
industry, the authors also participated in an embargo of the
results. The Spectre family of attacks is documented under
CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715.

D. Meltdown

Meltdown [47] is a related microarchitectural attack which
exploits out-of-order execution to leak kernel memory. Melt-
down is distinct from Spectre attacks in two main ways. First,
unlike Spectre, Meltdown does not use branch prediction.
Instead, it relies on the observation that when an instruction
causes a trap, following instructions are executed out-of-
order before being terminated. Second, Meltdown exploits a
vulnerability speciﬁc to many Intel and some ARM processors
which allows certain speculatively executed instructions to
bypass memory protection. Combining these issues, Meltdown
accesses kernel memory from user space. This access causes a
trap, but before the trap is issued, the instructions that follow
the access leak the contents of the accessed memory through
a cache covert channel.

In contrast, Spectre attacks work on a wider range of proces-
sors, including most AMD and ARM processors. Furthermore,
the KAISER mechanism [29], which has been widely applied
as a mitigation to the Meltdown attack, does not protect against
Spectre.

II. BACKGROUND

In this section, we describe some of the microarchitectural
components of modern high-speed processors, how they im-
prove performance, and how they can leak information from
running programs. We also describe return-oriented program-
ming (ROP) and gadgets.

A. Out-of-order Execution

An out-of-order execution paradigm increases the utilization
of the processor’s components by allowing instructions further
down the instruction stream of a program to be executed in
parallel with, and sometimes before, preceding instructions.

Modern processors internally work with micro-ops, emu-
lating the instruction set of the architecture, i.e., instructions
are decoded into micro-ops [15]. Once all of the micro-
ops corresponding to an instruction, as well as all preceding
instructions, have been completed,
the instructions can be
retired, committing in their changes to registers and other
architectural state and freeing the reorder buffer space. As a
result, instructions are retired in program execution order.

B. Speculative Execution

Often, the processor does not know the future instruction
stream of a program. For example, this occurs when out-of-
order execution reaches a conditional branch instruction whose
direction depends on preceding instructions whose execution
is not completed yet. In such cases, the processor can preserve
its current register state, make a prediction as to the path that
the program will follow, and speculatively execute instructions
along the path. If the prediction turns out to be correct, the
results of the speculative execution are committed (i.e., saved),
yielding a performance advantage over idling during the wait.
Otherwise, when the processor determines that it followed the
wrong path, it abandons the work it performed speculatively
by reverting its register state and resuming along the correct
path.

We refer to instructions which are performed erroneously
(i.e., as the result of a misprediction), but may leave mi-
croarchitectural traces, as transient instructions. Although the
speculative execution maintains the architectural state of the
program as if execution followed the correct path, microarchi-
tectural elements may be in a different (but valid) state than
before the transient execution.

Speculative execution on modern CPUs can run several
hundred instructions ahead. The limit is typically governed
by the size of the reorder buffer in the CPU. For instance, on
the Haswell microarchitecture, the reorder buffer has sufﬁcient
space for 192 micro-ops [15]. Since there is not a one-to-one
relationship between the number of micro-ops and instructions,
the limit depends on which instructions are used.

C. Branch Prediction

During speculative execution, the processor makes guesses
as to the likely outcome of branch instructions. Better pre-
dictions improve performance by increasing the number of
speculatively executed operations that can be successfully
committed.

The branch predictors of modern Intel processors, e.g.,
Haswell Xeon processors, have multiple prediction mecha-
nisms for direct and indirect branches. Indirect branch in-
structions can jump to arbitrary target addresses computed at
runtime. For example, x86 instructions can jump to an address
in a register, memory location, or on the stack e.g., “jmp

eax”, “jmp [eax]”, and “ret”. Indirect branches are also
supported on ARM (e.g., “MOV pc, r14”), MIPS (e.g., “jr
$ra”), RISC-V (e.g., “jalr x0,x1,0”), and other proces-
sors. To compensate for the additional ﬂexibility as compared
to direct branches, indirect jumps and calls are optimized using
at least two different prediction mechanisms [35].
Intel [35] describes that the processor predicts
• “Direct Calls and Jumps” in a static or monotonic manner,
• “Indirect Calls and Jumps” either in a monotonic manner,
or in a varying manner, which depends on recent program
behavior, and for

• “Conditional Branches” the branch target and whether the

branch will be taken.
Consequently, several processor components are used for
predicting the outcome of branches. The Branch Target Buffer
(BTB) keeps a mapping from addresses of recently executed
branch instructions to destination addresses [44]. Processors
can use the BTB to predict future code addresses even before
decoding the branch instructions. Evtyushkin et al. [14] ana-
lyzed the BTB of an Intel Haswell processor and concluded
that only the 31 least signiﬁcant bits of the branch address are
used to index the BTB.

For conditional branches, recording the target address is not
necessary for predicting the outcome of the branch since the
destination is typically encoded in the instruction while the
condition is determined at runtime. To improve predictions,
the processor maintains a record of branch outcomes, both
for recent direct and indirect branches. Bhattacharya et al. [9]
analyzed the structure of branch history prediction in recent
Intel processors.

Although return instructions are a type of indirect branch,
a separate mechanism for predicting the destination address is
often used in modern CPUs. The Return Stack Buffer (RSB)
maintains a copy of the most recently used portion of the
call stack [15]. If no data is available in the RSB, different
processors will either stall the execution or use the BTB as a
fallback [15].

Branch-prediction logic, e.g., BTB and RSB, is typically not
shared across physical cores [19]. Hence, the processor learns
only from previous branches executed on the same core.

D. The Memory Hierarchy

To bridge the speed gap between the faster processor and
the slower memory, processors use a hierarchy of successively
smaller but faster caches. The caches divide the memory into
ﬁxed-size chunks called lines, with typical line sizes being 64
or 128 bytes. When the processor needs data from memory,
it ﬁrst checks if the L1 cache, at the top of the hierarchy,
contains a copy. In the case of a cache hit, i.e., the data is
found in the cache, the data is retrieved from the L1 cache and
used. Otherwise, in the case of a cache miss, the procedure is
repeated to attempt to retrieve the data from the next cache
levels, and ﬁnally external memory. Once a read is completed,
the data is typically stored in the cache (and a previously
cached value is evicted to make room) in case it is needed
again in the near future. Modern Intel processors typically

have three cache levels, with each core having dedicated L1
and L2 caches and all cores sharing a common L3 cache, also
known as the Last-Level Cache (LLC).

A processor must ensure that the per-core L1 and L2 caches
are coherent using a cache coherence protocol, often based
on the MESI protocol [35]. In particular, the use of the MESI
protocol or some of its variants implies that a memory write
operation on one core will cause copies of the same data
in the L1 and L2 caches of other cores to be marked as
invalid, meaning that future accesses to this data on other
cores will not be able to quickly load the data from the L1
or L2 cache [53, 68]. When this happens repeatedly to a
speciﬁc memory location, this is informally called cache-line
bouncing. Because memory is cached with a line granularity,
this can happen even if two cores access different nearby
memory locations that map to the same cache line. This
behavior is called false sharing and is well-known as a source
of performance issues [33]. These properties of the cache
coherency protocol can sometimes be abused as a replacement
for cache eviction using the clflush instruction or eviction
patterns [27]. This behavior was previously explored as a
potential mechanism to facilitate Rowhammer attacks [16].

E. Microarchitectural Side-Channel Attacks

All of the microarchitectural components we discussed
above improve the processor performance by predicting fu-
ture program behavior. To that aim, they maintain state that
depends on past program behavior and assume that future
behavior is similar to or related to past behavior.

When multiple programs execute on the same hardware,
either concurrently or via time sharing, changes in the microar-
chitectural state caused by the behavior of one program may
affect other programs. This, in turn, may result in unintended
information leaks from one program to another [19].

lower level caches [30, 38, 48, 74],

Initial microarchitectural side channel attacks exploited tim-
ing variability [43] and leakage through the L1 data cache
to extract keys from cryptographic primitives [52, 55, 69].
Over the years, channels have been demonstrated over mul-
including the instruc-
tiple microarchitectural components,
tion cache [3],
the
BTB [14, 44], and branch history [1, 2]. The targets of at-
tacks have broadened to encompass co-location detection [59],
breaking ASLR [14, 26, 72], keystroke monitoring [25], web-
site ﬁngerprinting [51], and genome processing [10]. Recent
results include cross-core and cross-CPU attacks [37, 75],
cloud-based attacks [32, 76], attacks on and from trusted
execution environments [10, 44, 61], attacks from mobile
code [23, 46, 51], and new attack techniques [11, 28, 44].

In this work, we use the Flush+Reload technique [30, 74],
and its variant Evict+Reload [25], for leaking sensitive infor-
mation. Using these techniques, the attacker begins by evicting
a cache line from the cache that is shared with the victim. After
the victim executes for a while, the attacker measures the time
it takes to perform a memory read at the address corresponding
to the evicted cache line. If the victim accessed the monitored
cache line, the data will be in the cache, and the access will

be fast. Otherwise, if the victim has not accessed the line,
the read will be slow. Hence, by measuring the access time,
the attacker learns whether the victim accessed the monitored
cache line between the eviction and probing steps.

The main difference between the two techniques is the
mechanism used for evicting the monitored cache line from
the cache. In the Flush+Reload technique, the attacker uses
a dedicated machine instruction, e.g., x86’s clflush,
to
evict the line. Using Evict+Reload, eviction is achieved by
forcing contention on the cache set that stores the line, e.g.,
by accessing other memory locations which are loaded into
the cache and (due to the limited size of the cache) cause
the processor to discard (evict) the line that is subsequently
probed.

F. Return-Oriented Programming

Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) [63] is a technique
that allows an attacker who hijacks control ﬂow to make
a victim perform complex operations by chaining together
machine code snippets, called gadgets, found in the code of
the vulnerable victim. More speciﬁcally, the attacker ﬁrst ﬁnds
usable gadgets in the victim binary. Each gadget performs
some computation before executing a return instruction. An
attacker who can modify the stack pointer, e.g., to point to
return addresses written into an externally-writable buffer, or
overwrite the stack contents, e.g., using a buffer overﬂow, can
make the stack pointer point to the beginning of a series of
maliciously-chosen gadget addresses. When executed, each
return instruction jumps to a destination address from the
stack. Because the attacker controls this series of addresses,
each return effectively jumps into the next gadget in the chain.

III. ATTACK OVERVIEW

Spectre attacks induce a victim to speculatively perform
operations that would not occur during strictly serialized in-
order processing of the program’s instructions, and which leak
victim’s conﬁdential information via a covert channel to the
adversary. We ﬁrst describe variants that leverage conditional
branch mispredictions (Section IV), then variants that leverage
misprediction of the targets of indirect branches (Section V).
In most cases, the attack begins with a setup phase, where
the adversary performs operations that mistrain the processor
so that it will later make an exploitably erroneous speculative
prediction. In addition, the setup phase usually includes steps
that help induce speculative execution, such as manipulating
the cache state to remove data that the processor will need to
determine the actual control ﬂow. During the setup phase, the
adversary can also prepare the covert channel that will be used
for extracting the victim’s information, e.g., by performing the
ﬂush or evict part of a Flush+Reload or Evict+Reload attack.
During the second phase, the processor speculatively exe-
cutes instruction(s) that transfer conﬁdential information from
the victim context into a microarchitectural covert channel.
This may be triggered by having the attacker request that the
victim perform an action, e.g., via a system call, a socket, or a
ﬁle. In other cases, the attacker may leverage the speculative

(mis-)execution of its own code to obtain sensitive information
from the same process. For example, attack code which is
sandboxed by an interpreter, just-in-time compiler, or ‘safe’
language may wish to read memory it is not supposed to
access. While speculative execution can potentially expose
sensitive data via a broad range of covert channels,
the
examples given cause speculative execution to ﬁrst read a
memory value at an attacker-chosen address then perform a
memory operation that modiﬁes the cache state in a way that
exposes the value.

For the ﬁnal phase, the sensitive data is recovered. For Spec-
tre attacks using Flush+Reload or Evict+Reload, the recovery
process consists of timing the access to memory addresses in
the cache lines being monitored.

Spectre attacks only assume that speculatively executed
instructions can read from memory that the victim process
could access normally, e.g., without triggering a page fault
or exception. Hence, Spectre is orthogonal to Meltdown [47]
which exploits scenarios where some CPUs allow out-of-order
execution of user instructions to read kernel memory. Conse-
quently, even if a processor prevents speculative execution of
instructions in user processes from accessing kernel memory,
Spectre attacks still work [17].

IV. VARIANT 1: EXPLOITING CONDITIONAL BRANCH
MISPREDICTION

In this section, we demonstrate how conditional branch
misprediction can be exploited by an attacker to read arbitrary
memory from another context, e.g., another process.

Consider the case where the code in Listing 1 is part of a
function (e.g., a system call or a library) receiving an unsigned
integer x from an untrusted source. The process running the
code has access to an array of unsigned bytes array1 of
size array1_size, and a second byte array array2 of
size 1 MB.

if (x < array1_size)

y = array2[array1[x] * 4096];

Listing 1: Conditional Branch Example

The code fragment begins with a bounds check on x which
is essential for security. In particular, this check prevents the
processor from reading sensitive memory outside of array1.
Otherwise, an out-of-bounds input x could trigger an exception
or could cause the processor to access sensitive memory by
supplying x = (address of a secret byte to read) − (base
address of array1).

Figure 1 illustrates the four cases of the bounds check in
combination with speculative execution. Before the result of
the bounds check is known, the CPU speculatively executes
code following the condition by predicting the most likely
outcome of the comparison. There are many reasons why the
result of a bounds check may not be immediately known,
e.g., a cache miss preceding or during the bounds check,
congestion of an execution unit required for the bounds
check, complex arithmetic dependencies, or nested speculative

check is incorrectly predicted as true, an attacker can leak
secret information in certain scenarios.

execution. However, as illustrated, a correct prediction of the
condition in these cases leads to faster overall execution.

Unfortunately, during speculative execution, the conditional
branch for the bounds check can follow the incorrect path.
In this example, suppose an adversary causes the code to run
such that:

• the value of x is maliciously chosen (out-of-bounds), such
that array1[x] resolves to a secret byte k somewhere
in the victim’s memory;

since the victim’s

To complete the attack,

the adversary measures which
location in array2 was brought
into the cache, e.g.,
via Flush+Reload or Prime+Probe. This reveals the value
of k,
speculative execution cached
array2[k*4096]. Alternatively, the adversary can also use
Evict+Time, i.e., immediately call the target function again
with an in-bounds value x’ and measure how long this
second call takes. If array1[x’] equals k, then the location
accessed in array2 is in the cache, and the operation tends
to be faster.

Many different scenarios can lead to exploitable leaks using
this variant. For example, instead of performing a bounds
check, the mispredicted conditional branch(es) could be check-
ing a previously-computed safety result or an object type.
Similarly, the code that is speculatively executed can take
other forms, such as leaking a comparison result into a ﬁxed
memory location or may be spread over a much larger number
of instructions. The cache status described above is also
more restrictive than may be required. For example, in some
scenarios, the attack works even if array1_size is cached,
e.g., if branch prediction results are applied during speculative
execution even if the values involved in the comparison are
known. Depending on the processor, speculative execution
may also be initiated in a variety of situations. Further variants
are discussed in Section VI.

• array1_size and array2 are uncached, but k is

A. Experimental Results

cached; and

• previous operations received values of x that were valid,
leading the branch predictor to assume the if will likely
be true.

This cache conﬁguration can occur naturally or can be created
by an adversary, e.g., by causing eviction of array1_size
and array2 then having the kernel use the secret key in a
legitimate operation.

When the compiled code above runs,

the processor
begins by comparing the malicious value of x against
array1_size. Reading array1_size results in a cache
miss, and the processor faces a substantial delay until its value
is available from DRAM. Especially if the branch condition, or
an instruction somewhere before the branch, waits for an argu-
ment that is uncached, it may take some time until the branch
result is determined. In the meantime, the branch predictor
assumes the if will be true. Consequently, the speculative
execution logic adds x to the base address of array1 and
requests the data at the resulting address from the memory
subsystem. This read is a cache hit, and quickly returns the
value of the secret byte k. The speculative execution logic then
uses k to compute the address of array2[k * 4096]. It
then sends a request to read this address from memory (result-
ing in a cache miss). While the read from array2 is already
in ﬂight, the branch result may ﬁnally be determined. The
processor realizes that its speculative execution was erroneous
and rewinds its register state. However, the speculative read
from array2 affects the cache state in an address-speciﬁc
manner, where the address depends on k.

i5-6200U,

We performed experiments on multiple x86 processor ar-
chitectures,
including Intel Ivy Bridge (i7-3630QM), Intel
Haswell (i7-4650U), Intel Broadwell (i7-5650U), Intel Skylake
(unspeciﬁed Xeon on Google Cloud,
i7-6600U,
i7-6700K), Intel Kaby Lake (i7-7660U), and AMD Ryzen.
The Spectre vulnerability was observed on all of these CPUs.
Similar results were observed on both 32- and 64-bit modes,
and both Linux and Windows. Some processors based on the
ARM architecture also support speculative execution [7], and
our initial testing on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC (with
a Qualcomm Kyro 280 CPU) and on a Samsung Exynos 7420
Octa SoC (with Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 CPUs) conﬁrmed
that these ARM processors are impacted. We also observe that
speculative execution can proceed far ahead of the instruction
pointer. On a Haswell i7-4650U, the code in Appendix C
(cf. Section IV-B) works with up to 188 simple instructions
inserted in the source code between the ‘if’ statement and
the line accessing array1/array2, which is just below the
192 micro-ops that ﬁt in the reorder buffer of this processor
(cf. Section II-B).

B. Example Implementation in C

Appendix C includes a proof-of-concept code in C for
x86 processors1 which closely follows the description in
Section IV. The unoptimized implementation can read around
10 KB/s on an i7-4650U with a low (< 0.01%) error rate.

1The code can also be found in an anonymous Gist: https://gist.github.com/

anonymous/99a72c9c1003f8ae0707b4927ec1bd8a

C. Example Implementation in JavaScript

We developed a proof-of-concept in JavaScript and tested it
in Google Chrome version 62.0.3202 which allows a website
to read private memory from the process in which it runs. The
code is illustrated in Listing 2.

On branch-predictor mistraining passes, index is set
(via bit operations) to an in-range value. On the ﬁnal it-
eration, index is set
to an out-of-bounds address into
simpleByteArray. We used a variable localJunk to
ensure that operations are not optimized out. According to
the “|0” operation
ECMAScript 5.1 Section 11.10 [13],
converts the value to a 32-bit integer, acting as an optimiza-
tion hint to the JavaScript interpreter. Like other optimized
JavaScript engines, V8 performs just-in-time compilation to
convert JavaScript into machine language. Dummy operations
were placed in the code surrounding Listing 2 to make
simpleByteArray.length be stored in local memory so
that it can be removed from the cache during the attack. See
Listing 3 for the resulting disassembly output from D8.

Since the clflush instruction is not accessible from
JavaScript, we use cache eviction instead [27, 51],
i.e.,
we access other memory locations in a way such that
the target memory locations are evicted afterwards. The
status of
leaked results
conveyed via
probeTable[n*4096] for n ∈ 0..255, so the attacker
has to evict
these 256 cache lines. The length parameter
(simpleByteArray.length in the JavaScript code and
[ebp-0xe0] in the disassembly) needs to be evicted as
well. JavaScript does not provide access to the rdtscp
instruction, and Chrome intentionally degrades the accuracy
of its high-resolution timer to dissuade timing attacks using
performance.now() [62]. However,
the Web Workers
feature of HTML5 makes it simple to create a separate
thread that repeatedly decrements a value in a shared memory
location [24, 60]. This approach yields a high-resolution timer
that provides sufﬁcient resolution.

D. Example Implementation Exploiting eBPF

As a third example of exploiting conditional branches,
we developed a reliable proof-of-concept which leaks kernel
memory from an unmodiﬁed Linux kernel without patches
against Spectre by abusing the eBPF (extended BPF) interface.
eBPF is a Linux kernel
interface based on the Berkeley
Packet Filter (BPF) [49] that can be used for a variety of
purposes, including ﬁltering packets based on their contents.
eBPF permits unprivileged users to trigger the interpretation
or JIT-compilation and subsequent execution of user-supplied,
kernel-veriﬁed eBPF bytecode in the context of the kernel.
The basic concept of the attack is similar to the concept of
the attack against JavaScript.

In this attack, we use the eBPF code only for the specu-
latively executed code. We use native code in user space to
acquire the covert channel information. This is a difference
to the JavaScript example above, where both functions are
implemented in the scripted language. To speculatively access
secret-dependent locations in user-space memory, we perform

speculative out-of-bounds memory accesses to an array in
kernel memory, with an index large enough that user-space
memory is accessed instead. The proof-of-concept assumes
that the targeted processor does not support Supervisor Mode
Access Prevention (SMAP). However, attacks without
this
assumption are also possible. It was tested on an Intel Xeon
Haswell E5-1650 v3, on which it works both in the default
interpreted mode and the non-default JIT-compiled mode of
eBPF. In a highly optimized implementation, we are able to
leak up to 2000 B/s in this setup. It was also tested on an
AMD PRO A8-9600 R7 processor, on which it only works in
the non-default JIT-compiled mode. We leave the investigation
of reasons for this open for future work.

The eBPF subsystem manages data structures stored in
kernel memory. Users can request creation of these data
structures, and these data structures can then be accessed
from eBPF bytecode. To enforce memory safety for these
operations, the kernel stores some metadata associated with
each such data structure and performs checks against this
metadata. In particular, the metadata includes the size of the
data structure (which is set once when the data structure is
created and used to prevent out-of-bounds accesses) and the
number of references from eBPF programs that are loaded
into the kernel. The reference count tracks how many eBPF
programs referencing the data structure are running, ensuring
that memory belonging to the data structure is not released
while loaded eBPF programs reference it.

We increase the latency of bounds checks against the lengths
of eBPF-managed arrays by abusing false sharing. The kernel
stores the array length and the reference count in the same
cache line, permitting an attacker to move the cache line
containing the array length onto another physical CPU core
in Modified state (cf. [16, 53]). This is done by loading
and discarding an eBPF program that references the eBPF
array on the other physical core, which causes the kernel to
increment and decrement the array’s reference counter on the
other physical core. This attack achieves a leakage rate of
roughly 5000 B/s on a Haswell CPU.

E. Accuracy of Recovered Data

Spectre attacks can reveal data with high accuracy, but errors
can arise for several reasons. Tests to discover whether a
memory location is cached typically use timing measurements,
whose accuracy may be limited (such as in JavaScript or many
ARM platforms). As a result, multiple attack iterations may
be required to make a reliable determination. Errors can also
occur if array2 elements become cached unexpectedly, e.g.,
as a result of hardware prefectching, operating system activ-
ities, or other processes accessing the memory (for example
if array2 corresponds to memory in a shared library that
other processes are using). Attackers can redo attack passes
that result in no elements or 2+ elements in array2 becoming
cached. Tests using this simple repetition criteria (but no other
error correction) and accurate rdtscp-based timing yielded
error rates of approximately 0.005% on both Intel Skylake and
Kaby Lake processors.

Fig. 2: The branch predictor is (mis-)trained in the attacker-
controlled context A. In context B, the branch predictor makes
its prediction on the basis of training data from context A,
leading to speculative execution at an attacker-chosen address
which corresponds to the location of the Spectre gadget in the
victim’s address space.

V. VARIANT 2: POISONING INDIRECT BRANCHES

In this section, we demonstrate how indirect branches can
be poisoned by an attacker and the resulting misprediction of
indirect branches can be exploited to read arbitrary memory
from another context, e.g., another process. Indirect branches
are commonly used in programs across all architectures (cf.
Section II-C). If the determination of the destination address of
an indirect branch is delayed, e.g., due to a cache miss, spec-
ulative execution will often continue at a location predicted
from previous code execution.

In Spectre variant 2, the adversary mistrains the branch
predictor with malicious destinations, such that speculative
execution continues at a location chosen by the adversary.
This is illustrated in Figure 2, where the branch predictor
is (mis-)trained in one context, and applies the prediction
in a different context. More speciﬁcally, the adversary can
misdirect speculative execution to locations that would never
occur during legitimate program execution. Since speculative
execution leaves measurable side effects, this is an extremely

powerful means for attackers, for example exposing victim
memory even in the absence of an exploitable conditional
branch misprediction (cf. Section IV).

For a simple example attack, we consider an attacker
seeking to read a victim’s memory, who has control over
two registers when an indirect branch occurs. This commonly
occurs in real-world binaries since functions manipulating
externally-received data routinely make function calls while
registers contain values that an attacker controls. Often these
values are ignored by the called function and instead they are
simply pushed onto the stack in the function prologue and
restored in the function epilogue.

The attacker also needs to locate a “Spectre gadget”, i.e.,
a code fragment whose speculative execution will transfer the
victim’s sensitive information into a covert channel. For this
example, a simple and effective gadget would be formed by
two instructions (which do not necessarily need to be adjacent)
where the ﬁrst adds (or XORs, subtracts, etc.) the memory
location addressed by an attacker-controlled register R1 onto
an attacker-controlled register R2, followed by any instruction
the address in R2. In this case,
that accesses memory at
the gadget provides the attacker control (via R1) over which
address to leak and control (via R2) over how the leaked
memory maps to an address which is read by the second
instruction. On the CPUs we tested, the gadget must reside
in memory executable by the victim for the CPU to perform
speculative execution. However, with several megabytes of
shared libraries mapped into most processes [25], an attacker
has ample space to search for gadgets without even having to
search in the victim’s own code.

Numerous other attacks are possible, depending on what
state is known or controlled by the adversary, where the
information sought by the adversary resides (e.g., registers,
stack, memory, etc.), the adversary’s ability to control spec-
ulative execution, what instruction sequences are available to
form gadgets, and what channels can leak information from

speculative operations. For example, a cryptographic function
that returns a secret value in a register may become exploitable
if the attacker can simply induce speculative execution at an
instruction that brings memory from the address speciﬁed in
the register into the cache. Likewise, although the example
above assumes that the attacker controls two registers, attacker
control over a single register, value on the stack, or memory
value is sufﬁcient for some gadgets.

In many ways, exploitation is similar to return-oriented
programming (ROP), except that correctly-written software is
vulnerable, gadgets are limited in their duration but need not
terminate cleanly (since the CPU will eventually recognize the
speculative error), and gadgets must exﬁltrate data via side
channels rather than explicitly. Still, speculative execution can
perform complex sequences of instructions, including reading
from the stack, performing arithmetic, branching (including
multiple times), and reading memory.
Mistraining branch predictors on x86 processors. The
attacker, from its own context, performs a mistraining of the
branch predictors to trick the processor into speculatively
executing the gadget when it runs the victim code. Our attack
process mimics the victim’s pattern of branches leading up to
the branch to be misdirected.

Note that the history mistraining requirements vary among
CPUs. For instance, on a Haswell i7-4650U, the low 20 bits of
the approximately 29 prior destination addresses are used, al-
though some further hashing on these addresses was observed.
On an AMD Ryzen, only the low 12 bits of the approximately
prior 9 branches are used. The reverse-engineered pseudo
code for updating the branch history buffer on an Intel Xeon
Haswell E5-1650 v3 is provided in Appendix A.

In addition, we placed a jump for mistraining at the same
virtual address in the attacker as in the victim process. Note
that this may not be necessary, e.g., if a CPU only indexes
predictions based on the low bits of the jump address. When
mistraining branch predictors, we only need to mimic the
virtual addresses; physical addresses, timing, and process ID
do not appear to matter. Since the branch prediction is not
inﬂuenced by operations on other cores (cf. Section II-C), any
mistraining has to be done on the same CPU core.

We also observed that branch predictors learn from jumps
to illegal destinations. Although an exception is triggered in
the attacker’s process, this can be caught easily, e.g., using a
signal handler on Linux or structured exception handling on
Windows. As in the previous case, the branch predictor will
then make predictions that send other processes to the same
destination address, but in the victim’s virtual address space
(i.e., the address space in which the gadget resides).

Lake (i7-7660U), AMD Ryzen, as well as some ARM proces-
sors. We were able to observe similar results on both 32- and
64-bit modes, and different operating systems and hypervisors.
To measure the effectiveness of branch poisoning, we im-
plemented a test victim program that repeatedly executes a
ﬁxed pattern of 32 indirect
jumps, ﬂushes the destination
address of the ﬁnal jump using clflush and uses Flush+
Reload on a probe memory location. The victim program also
included a test gadget that reads the probe location and is never
legitimately executed. We also implemented an attack program
that repeatedly executes 31 indirect jumps whose destinations
match the ﬁrst 31 jumps in the victim’s sequence followed by
an indirect jump to the virtual address of the victim’s gadget
(but in the attack process the instructions at this address return
control ﬂow back to the ﬁrst jump).

On a Haswell (i7-4650U) processor,

the victim process
executed 2.7 million iterations per second, and the attack
successfully poisoned the ﬁnal jump 99.7% of the time. On
a Kaby Lake (i7-7660U) processor, the victim executed 3.1
million iterations per second, with a 98.6% poisoning rate.
When the attack process stopped or executed on a different
core, no spurious cache hits at
the probe location were
observed. We thus conclude that indirect branch poisoning is
highly effective, including at speeds far above the rate at which
a typical victim program would perform a given indirect jump
that an attacker seeks to poison.

B. Indirect Branch Poisoning Proof-of-Concept on Windows

As a proof-of-concept, we constructed a simple target
application which provides the service of computing a SHA-
1 hash of a key and an input message. This implementation
consisted of a program which continuously runs a loop which
calls Sleep(0), loads the input from a ﬁle, invokes the
Windows cryptography functions to compute the hash, and
prints the hash whenever the input changes. We found that
the Sleep() call is done with data from the input ﬁle in
registers ebx, edi, and an attacker-known value for edx, i.e.,
the content of two registers is controlled by the attacker. This
is the input criteria for the type of Spectre gadget described
in the beginning of this section.

Searching the executable memory regions of the victim
process, we identiﬁed a byte sequence in ntdll.dll (on
both Windows 8 and Windows 10) which forms the following
(possibly misaligned) instruction sequence to use as a Spectre
gadget:

adc
adc

edi,dword ptr [ebx+edx+13BE13BDh]
dl,byte ptr [edi]

A. Experimental Results

Similar to our results on the conditional branch mispre-
diction (cf. Section IV-A), we observed the indirect branch
poisoning on multiple x86 processor architectures, including
Intel Ivy Bridge (i7-3630QM), Intel Haswell (i7-4650U), Intel
Broadwell (i7-5650U), Intel Skylake (unspeciﬁed Xeon on
Google Cloud, i5-6200U, i7-6600U, i7-6700K), Intel Kaby

Speculative execution of this gadget with attacker-controlled
ebx and edi allows an adversary to read the victim’s mem-
ory. The attacker sets edi to the base address of the probe
array, e.g., a memory region in a shared library, and sets
ebx = m − 0x13BE13BD − edx. Consequently, the ﬁrst
instruction reads a 32-bit value from address m and adds this
onto edi. The second instruction then fetches the index m

in the probe array into the cache. Similar gadgets can also be
found with byte-wise reads for the ﬁrst instruction.

For indirect branch poisoning, we targeted the ﬁrst instruc-
tion of the Sleep() function, where both the location of
the jump destination and the destination itself change per
reboot due to ASLR. To get the victim to execute the gadget
speculatively, the memory location containing the jump was
ﬂushed from the cache, and the branch predictor mistrained
to send speculative execution into the Spectre gadget. Since
the memory page containing the destination for the jump was
mapped copy-on-write, we were able to mistrain the branch
predictor by modifying the attacker copy of the Sleep()
function, changing the jump destination to the gadget address,
and place a ret instruction there. The mistraining was then
done by repeatedly jumping to the gadget address from mul-
tiple threads.

Code ASLR on Win32 only changes a few address bits, so
only a few combinations needed to be tried to ﬁnd a training
sequence that works on the victim. A single-instruction gadget,
comprising the instruction sbb eax,[esp+ebx], was used
to locate the stack.

In the attack process, a separate thread was used to mistrain
the branch predictor. This thread runs on the same core as
the victim (e.g., via hyperthreading), thus sharing the branch
predictor state. Because the branch predictor uses the pre-
ceding jump history in making predictions, each mistraining
iteration mimics the victim’s branch history prior to the jump
to redirect. Although mistraining could exactly match the exact
virtual addresses and instruction types of the victim, this is not
necessary. Instead, each mistraining iteration uses a series of
ret instructions whose destination addresses match the low
20 bits of the victim’s jump history (mapped to addresses in a
1 MB (220-byte) executable array ﬁlled with ret instructions).
After mimicking the history, the mistraining thread executes
the jump to redirect (which is modiﬁed to jump to the gadget).

The attacker can then leak memory by choosing values
for ebx (adjusting which memory address to read) and edi
(adjusting how the read result maps into the probe array).
Using Flush+Reload, the attacker then infers values from the
victim process. In Listing 1, the read value is spread over cache
lines, and can thus easily be inferred. However, in the example
above the least signiﬁcant 6 bits of the value are not spread
over cache lines, and thus values which fall into the same
cache line are not distinguishable with a basic Flush+Reload
attack. To distinguish such values, the base address of the
probe array can be shifted byte-wise to identify the threshold
where the accessed value falls into the consecutive cache
line. By repeating the attack, the attacker can read arbitrary
memory from the victim process. An unoptimized proof-of-
concept implementation on an Intel Haswell (i7-4650U), with
the ﬁle used by the attacker to inﬂuence the victim’s registers
placed on a RAM drive, reads 41 B/s including the overhead
to backtrack and correct errors (about 2% of attempts).

C. Reverse-Engineering Branch Prediction Internals

We now describe the basic approach used to reverse-
engineer Intel Haswell branch predictor internals in prepa-
ration for the attack against KVM. Such reverse-engineering
is helpful
to optimize branch predictor mistraining or to
characterize a processor’s vulnerability, although in practice
mistraining can often be achieved without full understanding
of the branch predictor.

The attack on KVM is described in Section V-D.
For reverse engineering, we started with information avail-
able from public sources. Intel’s public documentation con-
tains some basic but authoritative information about the branch
prediction implementations in its processors [35]. Agner
Fog [15] describes the basic ideas behind the branch prediction
of Intel Haswell processors. Finally, we used information from
prior research which reverse-engineered how direct jumps are
predicted on Intel processors [14].

The structure of the branch history buffer (BHB) is a logical
extension of the pattern history presented by [15]. The BHB
helps make predictions on the basis of instruction histories,
while preserving simplicity and the property of providing a
rolling hash. This naturally leads to a history buffer with
overlapping data, XOR-combinations (the simplest way to
mix two pieces of data), and no extra forward or backward
propagation inside the history buffer (to preserve the rolling
hash property in a simple way).

To determine the precise functions used by the branch
predictor, predictor collisions were leveraged. We set up two
hyperthreads that run identical code leading up to high-
latency indirect branches with different targets. The process
in hyperthread A was conﬁgured to execute a jump to target
address 1, while the process in hyperthread B was conﬁgured
to execute a jump to target address 2. In addition, code was
placed in hyperthread A at target address 2 that loads a cache
line for Flush+Reload. We then measured how often that cache
line was loaded in hyperthread A; this is the misprediction
rate. A high misprediction rate indicates that the processor
cannot distinguish the two branches, while a low misprediction
rate indicates that the processor can distinguish them. Various
changes, such as ﬂipping one or two bits at a time in addresses,
were applied in one of the threads. The misprediction rate
then acts as a binary oracle, revealing whether a given bit
inﬂuences branch prediction at all (single bit ﬂip) or whether
two bits are XORed together (two bit ﬂips at positions that
cause high low misprediction rates when ﬂipped individually
but low misprediction rates when both ﬂipped).

Combining this knowledge yields the overview shown in

Figure 3.

D. Attack against KVM

We implemented an attack (using an Intel Xeon Haswell
E5-1650 v3, running Linux kernel package linux-image-4.9.0-
3-amd64 at version 4.9.30-2+deb9u2) that leaks host memory
from inside a guest VM, provided that the attacker has access
to guest ring 0 (i.e., has full control over the operating system
running inside the VM).

The ﬁrst phase of the attack determines information about
the environment. It ﬁnds the hypervisor ASLR location by ana-
lyzing branch history buffer and branch target buffer leaks [14,
72]. It also ﬁnds L3 cache set association information [48],
as well as physical memory map location information using
a Spectre gadget executed via branch target injection. This
initialization step takes 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the
processor. It then leaks hypervisor memory from attacker-
chosen addresses by executing the eBPF interpreter in hy-
pervisor memory as a Spectre gadget using indirect branch
poisoning (aka branch target injection), targeting the primary
prediction mechanism for indirect branches. We are able to
leak 1809 B/s with 1.7% of bytes wrong/unreadable.

VI. VARIATIONS

So far we have demonstrated attacks that leverage changes
in the state of the cache that occur during speculative execu-
tion. Future processors (or existing processors with different
microcode) may behave differently, e.g., if measures are taken
to prevent speculatively executed code from modifying the
cache state. In this section, we examine potential variants of
the attack, including how speculative execution could affect
the state of other microarchitectural components. In general,
Spectre attacks can be combined with other microarchitectural
attacks. In this section, we explore potential combinations and
conclude that virtually any observable effect of speculatively
executed code can potentially lead to leaks of sensitive infor-
mation. Although the following techniques are not needed for
the processors tested (and have not been implemented), it is
essential to understand potential variations when designing or
evaluating mitigations.

Spectre variant 4. Spectre variant 4 uses speculation in the
store-to-load forwarding logic [31]. The processor speculates
that a load does not depend on the previous store [73]. The
exploitation mechanics are similar to variant 1 and 2 that we
discussed in detail in this paper.

Evict+Time. The Evict+Time attack [52] works by measuring
the timing of operations that depend on the state of the cache.

This technique can be adapted to use Spectre as follows.
Consider the code:

if (false but mispredicts as true)

f

a

l

l

b

a

c

k

read array1[R1]

read [R2]

Suppose register R1 contains a secret value. If the specula-
tively executed memory read of array1[R1] is a cache hit,
then nothing will go on the memory bus, and the read from
[R2] will initiate quickly. If the read of array1[R1] is a
cache miss, then the second read may take longer, resulting
in different timing for the victim thread. In addition, other
components in the system that can access memory (such as
other processors) may be able to sense the presence of activity
on the memory bus or other effects of the memory read, e.g.,
changing the DRAM row address select [56]. We note that
this attack, unlike those we have implemented, would work
even if speculative execution does not modify the contents
of the cache. All that is required is that the state of the cache
affects the timing of speculatively executed code or some other
property that ultimately becomes visible to the attacker.
Instruction Timing.
Spectre vulnerabilities do not nec-
essarily need to involve caches. Instructions whose timing
depends on the values of the operands may leak information
on the operands [6]. In the following example, the multiplier
is occupied by the speculative execution of multiply R1,
R2. The timing of when the multiplier becomes available
for multiply R3, R4 (either for out-of-order execution or
after the misprediction is recognized) could be affected by the
timing of the ﬁrst multiplication, revealing information about
R1 and R2.

if (false but mispredicts as true)

multiply R1, R2

multiply R3, R4

Contention on the Register File.
Suppose the CPU has
a register ﬁle with a ﬁnite number of registers available for
storing checkpoints for speculative execution. In the following
example, if condition on R1 in the second ‘if’ is true,
then an extra speculative execution checkpoint will be created
than if condition on R1 is false. If an adversary can
detect this checkpoint, e.g., if speculative execution of code
in hyperthreads is reduced due to a shortage of storage, this
reveals information about R1.

if (false but mispredicts as true)

if (condition on R1)
if (condition)

Variations on Speculative Execution.
Even code that
contains no conditional branches can potentially be at risk.
For example, consider the case where an attacker wishes to
determine whether R1 contains an attacker-chosen value X or
some other value. The ability to make such determinations is
sufﬁcient to break some cryptographic implementations. The
attacker mistrains the branch predictor such that, after an inter-
rupt occurs, the interrupt return mispredicts to an instruction

that reads memory [R1]. The attacker then chooses X to
correspond to a memory address suitable for Flush+Reload,
revealing whether R1 = X. While the iret instruction is
serializing on Intel CPUs, other processors may apply branch
predictions.
Leveraging Arbitrary Observable Effects. Virtually any ob-
servable effect of speculatively executed code can be leveraged
to create the covert channel that leaks sensitive information.
For example, consider the case where the example in Listing 1
runs on a processor where speculative reads cannot modify the
cache. In this case, the speculative lookup in array2 still
occurs, and its timing will be affected by the cache state en-
tering speculative execution. This timing in turn can affect the
depth and timing of subsequent speculative operations. Thus,
by manipulating the state of the cache prior to speculative
execution, an adversary can potentially leverage virtually any
observable effect from speculative execution.

if (x < array1_size) {

y = array2[array1[x] * 4096];
// do something detectable when
// speculatively executed

}

The ﬁnal observable operation could involve virtually any
side channel or covert channel, including contention for re-
sources (buses, arithmetic units, etc.) and conventional side
channel emanations (such as electromagnetic radiation or
power consumption).

A more general form of this would be:

if (x < array1_size) {

y = array1[x];
// do something using y that is
// observable when speculatively
// executed

}

VII. MITIGATION OPTIONS
Several countermeasures for Spectre attacks have been
proposed. Each addresses one or more of the features that
the attack relies upon. We now discuss these countermeasures
and their applicability, effectiveness, and cost.

A. Preventing Speculative Execution

Speculative execution is required for Spectre attacks. En-
suring that instructions are executed only when the control
ﬂow leading to them is ascertained would prevent speculative
execution and, with it, Spectre attacks. While effective as a
countermeasure, preventing speculative execution would cause
a signiﬁcant degradation in the performance of the processor.
Although current processors do not appear to have methods
that allow software to disable speculative execution, such
modes could be added in future processors, or in some
cases could potentially be introduced via microcode changes.
Alternatively, some hardware products (such as embedded
systems) could switch to alternate processor models that do not
implement speculative execution. Still, this solution is unlikely
to provide an immediate ﬁx to the problem.

Alternatively, the software could be modiﬁed to use seri-
alizing or speculation blocking instructions that ensure that
instructions following them are not executed speculatively.
Intel and AMD recommend the use of the lfence instruc-
tion [4, 36]. The safest (but slowest) approach to protect condi-
tional branches would be to add such an instruction on the two
outcomes of every conditional branch. However, this amounts
to disabling branch prediction and our tests indicate that this
would dramatically reduce performance [36]. An improved
approach is to use static analysis [36] to reduce the number
of speculation blocking instructions required, since many code
paths do not have the potential to read and leak out-of-bounds
memory. In contrast, Microsoft’s C compiler MSVC [54] takes
an approach of defaulting to unprotected code unless the static
analyzer detects a known-bad code pattern, but as a result
misses many vulnerable code patterns [40].

Inserting serializing instructions can also help mitigating
indirect branch poisoning. Inserting an lfence instruction
before an indirect branch ensures that the pipeline prior to the
branch is cleared and that the branch is resolved quickly [4].
This, in turn, reduces the number of instructions that are
executed speculatively in the case that the branch is poisoned.
The approach requires that all potentially vulnerable soft-
ware is instrumented. Hence, for protection, updated software
binaries and libraries are required. This could be an issue for
legacy software.

B. Preventing Access to Secret Data

Other countermeasures can prevent speculatively executed
code from accessing secret data. One such measure, used by
the Google Chrome web browser, is to execute each web
site in a separate process [67]. Because Spectre attacks only
leverage the victim’s permissions, an attack such as the one
we performed using JavaScript (cf. Section IV-C) would not
be able to access data from the processes assigned to other
websites.

WebKit employs two strategies for limiting access to secret
data by speculatively executed code [57]. The ﬁrst strategy
replaces array bounds checking with index masking. Instead
of checking that an array index is within the bounds of the
array, WebKit applies a bit mask to the index, ensuring that
it is not much bigger than the array size. While masking may
result in access outside the bounds of the array, this limits the
distance of the bounds violation, preventing the attacker from
accessing arbitrary memory.

The second strategy protects access to pointers by xoring
them with a pseudo-random poison value. The poison protects
the pointers in two distinct ways. First, an adversary who
does not know the poison value cannot use a poisoned pointer
(although various cache attacks could leak the poison value).
More signiﬁcantly, the poison value ensures that mispredic-
tions on the branch instructions used for type checks will result
in pointers associated with type being used for another type.
These approaches are most useful for just-in-time (JIT)
compilers, interpreters, and other language-based protections,

where the runtime environment has control over the executed
code and wishes to restrict the data that a program may access.

C. Preventing Data from Entering Covert Channels

Future processors could potentially track whether data was
fetched as the result of a speculative operation and, if so,
prevent that data from being used in subsequent operations
that might leak it. Current processors do not generally have
this capability, however.

D. Limiting Data Extraction from Covert Channels

To exﬁltrate information from transient instructions, Spectre
attacks use a covert communication channel. Multiple ap-
proaches have been suggested for mitigating such channels
(cf. [19]). As an attempted mitigation for our JavaScript-based
attack, major browser providers have further degraded the
resolution of the JavaScript timer, potentially adding jitter [50,
57, 66, 71]. These patches also disable SharedArrayBuffers,
which can be used to create a timing source [60].

While this countermeasure would necessitate additional
averaging for attacks such as the one in Section IV-C, the level
of protection it provides is unclear since error sources simply
reduce the rate at which attackers can exﬁltrate data. Further-
more, as [18] show, current processors lack the mechanisms
required for complete covert channel elimination. Hence, while
this approach may decrease attack performance, it does not
guarantee that attacks are not possible.

E. Preventing Branch Poisoning

To prevent indirect branch poisoning, Intel and AMD ex-
tended the ISA with a mechanism for controlling indirect
branches [4, 34]. The mechanism consists of three controls.
The ﬁrst, Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS), pre-
vents indirect branches in privileged code from being affected
by branches in less privileged code. The processor enters a spe-
cial IBRS mode, which is not inﬂuenced by any computations
outside of IBRS modes. The second, Single Thread Indirect
Branch Prediction (STIBP), restricts branch prediction sharing
between software executing on the hyperthreads of the same
core. Finally, Indirect Branch Predictor Barrier (IBPB), pre-
vents software running before setting the barrier from affecting
branch prediction by software running after the barrier, i.e., by
ﬂushing the BTB state. These controls are enabled following a
microcode patch and require operating system or BIOS support
for use. The performance impact varies from a few percent to a
factor of 4 or more, depending on which countermeasures are
employed, how comprehensively they are applied (e.g. limited
use in the kernel vs. full protection for all processes), and the
efﬁciency of the hardware and microcode implementations.

Google suggests an alternative mechanism for preventing
indirect branch poisoning called retpolines [70]. A retpoline
is a code sequence that replaces indirect branches with return
instructions. The construct further contains code that makes
sure that the return instruction is predicted to a benign endless
loop through the return stack buffer, while the actual target
destination is reached by pushing it on the stack and returning

to it i.e., using the ret instruction. When return instructions
can be predicted by other means the method may be impracti-
cal. Intel issued microcode updates for some processors, which
fall-back to the BTB for the prediction, to disable this fall-back
mechanism [36].

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
A fundamental assumption underpinning software security
techniques is that the processor will faithfully execute program
instructions, including its safety checks. This paper presents
Spectre attacks, which leverage the fact that speculative execu-
tion violates this assumption. The techniques we demonstrate
are practical, do not require any software vulnerabilities, and
allow adversaries to read private memory and register contents
from other processes and security contexts.

Software security fundamentally depends on having a clear
common understanding between hardware and software devel-
opers as to what information CPU implementations are (and
are not) permitted to expose from computations. As a result,
while the countermeasures described in the previous section
may help limit practical exploits in the short term, they are
only stop-gap measures since there is typically formal archi-
tectural assurance as to whether any speciﬁc code construction
is safe across today’s processors – much less future designs.
As a result, we believe that long-term solutions will require
fundamentally changing instruction set architectures.

More broadly, there are trade-offs between security and
performance. The vulnerabilities in this paper, as well as many
others, arise from a long-standing focus in the technology
industry on maximizing performance. As a result, processors,
compilers, device drivers, operating systems, and numerous
other critical components have evolved compounding layers
of complex optimizations that introduce security risks. As the
costs of insecurity rise, these design choices need to be revis-
ited. In many cases, alternative implementations optimized for
security will be required.

APPENDIX A
REVERSE-ENGINEERED INTEL HASWELL BRANCH
PREDICTION INTERNALS

the
This section describes reverse-engineered parts of
branch prediction mechanism of an Intel Xeon Haswell E5-
1650 v3. The primary mechanism for indirect call prediction
relies on a simple rolling hash of partial source and destination
addresses, combined with part of the source address of the call
instruction whose target should be predicted, as lookup key.
The rolling hash seems to be updated as shown in Listing 4,
when a normal branch is taken. The Branch Target Buffer used
by the primary mechanism seems to store targets as absolute
addresses.

The secondary mechanism for indirect call prediction (“pre-
dicted as having a monotonic target”) seems to use the partial
source address, with some bits folded together using XOR, as
lookup key. The destination address seems to be stored as a
combination of 32 bits containing the absolute lower half and
one bit specifying whether the jump crosses a 4 GB boundary.

APPENDIX B
INDIRECT BRANCH POISONING PROOF-OF-CONCEPT ON
WINDOWS

As a proof-of-concept for the indirect branch poisoning
attack, we developed an attack on a simple program keeping
a secret key. The simple program ﬁrst generates a random
key, then repeatedly calls Sleep(0), loads the ﬁrst bytes

unsigned long src,
unsigned long dst) {

1 /* ‘bhb_state‘ points to the branch history
2 * buffer to be updated
3 * ‘src‘ is the virtual address of the last
4 * byte of the source instruction
5 * ‘dst‘ is the virtual destination address
6 */
7 void bhb_update(uint58_t *bhb_state,
8
9
10 *bhb_state <<= 2;
11 *bhb_state ˆ= (dst & 0x3f);
12 *bhb_state ˆ= (src & 0xc0) >> 6;
13 *bhb_state ˆ= (src & 0xc00) >> (10 - 2);
14 *bhb_state ˆ= (src & 0xc000) >> (14 - 4);
15 *bhb_state ˆ= (src & 0x30) << (6 - 4);
16 *bhb_state ˆ= (src & 0x300) << (8 - 8);
17 *bhb_state ˆ= (src & 0x3000) >> (12 - 10);
18 *bhb_state ˆ= (src & 0x30000) >> (16 - 12);
19 *bhb_state ˆ= (src & 0xc0000) >> (18 - 14);

Listing 4: Pseudocode for updating the branch history buffer
state when a branch is encountered.

of a ﬁle (e.g., as a header), calls Windows crypto functions
to compute the SHA-1 hash of (key || header), and prints
the hash whenever the header changes. When this program
is compiled with optimization, the call to Sleep() is done
with ﬁle data in registers ebx and edi. No special effort
was taken to cause this; function calls with adversary-chosen
values in registers are common, although the speciﬁcs (such as
what values appear in which registers) are often determined by
compiler optimizations and therefore difﬁcult to predict from
source code. The test program did not include any memory
ﬂushing operations or other adaptations to help the attacker.
The ﬁrst step was to identify a gadget which, when specula-
tively executed with adversary-controlled values for ebx and
edi, would reveal attacker-chosen memory from the victim
process. This gadget must be in an executable page within
the working set of the victim process. Note that on Windows,
some pages in DLLs are mapped in the address space but
require a soft page fault before becoming part of the working
set. We wrote a simple program that saved its own working
set pages, which are largely representative of the working set
contents common to all applications. We then searched this
output for potential gadgets, yielding multiple usable options
for ebx and edi (as well as for other pairs of registers). Of
these, we arbitrarily chose the following byte sequence which
appears in ntdll.dll in both Windows 8 and Windows 10

13 BC 13 BD 13 BE 13
12 17

which, when executed, corresponds to the following instruc-
tions:

adc
adc

edi, dword ptr [ebx+edx+13BE13BDh]
dl, byte ptr [edi]

Speculative execution of this gadget with attacker-controlled
ebx and edi allows an adversary to read the victim’s mem-

ory. If the adversary chooses ebx = m − 0x13BE13BD −
edx, where edx = 3 for the sample program (as determined
by running in a debugger), the ﬁrst instruction reads the 32-bit
value from address m and adds this onto edi. In the victim,
the carry ﬂag happens to be clear, so no additional carry is
added. Since edi is also controlled by the attacker, speculative
execution of the second instruction will read (and bring into
the cache) the memory whose address is the sum of the
32-bit value loaded from address m and the attacker-chosen
edi. Thus, the attacker can map the 232 possible memory
values onto smaller regions, which can then be analyzed via
Flush+Reload to solve for memory bytes. For example, if the
bytes at m + 2 and m + 3 are known, the value in edi can
cancel out their contribution and map the second read to a
1 MB region which can be probed easily via Flush+Reload.

For branch mistraining we targeted the ﬁrst instruction of
the Sleep() function, which is a jump of the form “jmp
dword ptr ds:[76AE0078h]” (where both the location
of the jump destination and the destination itself change
per reboot due to ASLR). We chose this jump instruction
because it appeared that the attack process could clflush
the destination address, although (as noted later) this did not
work. In addition, unlike a return instruction, there were no
adjacent operations might un-evict the return address (e.g., by
accessing the stack) and limit speculative execution.

In order to get

the victim to speculatively execute the
gadget, we caused the memory location containing the jump
destination to be uncached. In addition, we mistrained the
branch predictor to send speculative execution to the gadget.
These were accomplished as follows:

• Simple pointer operations were used to locate the indirect
jump at the entry point for Sleep() and the memory
location holding the destination for the jump.

• A search of ntdll.dll in RAM was performed to ﬁnd
the gadget, and some shared DLL memory was chosen for
performing Flush+Reload detections.

• To prepare for branch predictor mistraining, the memory
page containing the destination for the jump was made
writable (via copy-on-write) and modiﬁed to change the
jump destination to the gadget address. Using the same
method, a ret 4 instruction was written at the location of
the gadget. These changes do not affect the memory seen
by the victim (which is running in a separate process), but
make it so that the attacker’s calls to Sleep() will jump
to the gadget address (mistraining the branch predictor)
then immediately return.

• A separate thread was launched to repeatedly evict the
victim’s memory address containing the jump destination.
Although the memory containing the destination has the
same virtual address for the attacker and victim, they ap-
pear to have different physical memory – perhaps because
of a prior copy-on-write. The eviction was done using the
same general method as the JavaScript example, i.e., by
allocating a large table and using a pair of indexes to read
addresses at 4096-byte multiples of the address to evict.

• Thread(s) were launched to mistrain the branch predictor.
These use a 220 byte (1MB) executable memory region
ﬁlled with 0xC3 bytes (ret instructions). The victim’s
pattern of jump destinations is mapped to addresses in
this area, with an adjustment for ASLR found during
an initial training process (see main paper). The branch
predictor mistraining threads run a loop which pushes the
mapped addresses onto the stack such that an initiating
ret instruction results in the processor performing a series
of return instructions in the memory region, then branches
to the gadget address, then (because of the ret placed
there) immediately returns back to the loop.

• To encourage hyperthreading of the mistraining thread and
the victim, the eviction and probing threads set their CPU
afﬁnity to share a core (which they keep busy), leaving
the victim and mistraining threads to share the rest of the
cores.

the victim is

• During the initial phase of getting the branch pre-
dictor mistraining working,
supplied
that, when the victim calls Sleep(),
with input
[ebx+3h+13BE13BDh] will read a DLL location whose
value is known and edi is chosen such that the second op-
eration will point to another location that can be monitored
easily. With these settings, the branch training sequence is
adjusted to compensate for the victim’s ASLR.

• As described in the main paper, a separate gadget was used

to ﬁnd the victim’s stack pointer.

• Finally, the attacker can read through the victim’s address
space to locate and read victim data regions to locate values
(which can move due to ASLR) by controlling the values
of ebx and edi and using Flush+Reload on the DLL
region selected above.

The completed attack allows the reading of memory from

the victim process.

APPENDIX C
SPECTRE EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION

if

In

the

Listing

compiled

instructions

in
victim_function() were executed in strict program
order, the function would only read from array1[0..15]
since array1_size = 16. Yet, when executed speculatively,
out-of-bounds reads occur and leak the secret string.
The read_memory_byte() function makes

several
training calls to victim_function() to make the branch
predictor expect valid values for x,
then calls with an
out-of-bounds x. The conditional branch mispredicts and
the ensuing speculative execution reads a secret byte us-
ing the out-of-bounds x. The speculative code then reads
from array2[array1[x] * 4096], leaking the value of
array1[x] into the cache state.

To complete the attack, the code uses a simple Flush+Reload
sequence to identify which cache line in array2 was loaded,
revealing the memory contents. The attack is repeated several
times, so even if the target byte was initially uncached, the
ﬁrst iteration will bring it into the cache. This unoptimized
implementation can read around 10 KB/s on an i7-4650U.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

USNS 3541-1 and 3523-1 provided mitigations for Spectre and Meltdown

([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715), [CVE-2017-5753](/security/CVE-2017-5753), [CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754)) for the i386, amd64,

and ppc64el architectures in Ubuntu 17.10. This update provides

the corresponding mitigations for the arm64 architecture. Original

advisory details:

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

* linux-image-raspi2
  -
  4.13.0.1015.13

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

SUMMARY

Security researchers published information on vulnerabilities known as Spectre, Meltdown, Spectre-NG,
Foreshadow, L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF), ZombieLoad, and Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS). These
vulnerabilities affect many modern processors from different vendors to a varying degree.

The latest release of SIMATIC WinAC RTX provides compatibility with the latest BIOS updates and
operating system patches from Intel and Microsoft.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010:
All versions < SIMATIC WinAC RTX 2010 SP3

Update to SIMATIC WinAC RTX 2010 SP3 and
apply BIOS and Microsoft Windows updates
https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/
view/109765109

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• As a prerequisite for an attack, an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems.
Therefore, Siemens recommends determining if it is possible that untrusted code can be run
on these systems, or if existing measures implemented by the operator reduce the likelihood of
untrusted code being run.

Siemens recommends limiting the possibilities to run untrusted code if possible.

• Applying a Defense-in-Depth concept can help to reduce the probability that untrusted code is run
on the system. Siemens recommends to apply the Defense-in-Depth concept: https://www.siemens.
com/industrialsecurity

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Yesterday the security community and a number of IT vendors announced the existence of several hardware security vulnerabilities that allow potential exploits across a range of hardware architectures and operating systems including but not limited to Linux.

<https://meltdownattack.com/>

SUSE engineers have been collaborating with our partners and the Linux community on upstream Linux kernel patches. As a result of that collaboration, we are now able to release patches for most recent SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) versions. Additional patches for other SLE versions and environments will follow shortly.

Up to date information on all the patches available will be continually posted here on this [Technical Information Document page](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7022512).

Additional details on specific vulnerabilities will be posted here in CVE reports:

<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5753/>

<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5715/>

<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5754/>

Due to the nature of this issue, applying the maintenance updates will require a reboot of the operating system.

As research on these issues continues across the industry, additional optimizations and information may emerge and we will provide continually updated details here in this blog and on the pages referenced above.

We would like to thank all those in the upstream Linux Kernel Community whose passion, dedication and collaboration were critical to addressing these issues.

For further details, please contact your SUSE support representative.

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has 13 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP2 kernel was updated to receive various
security and bugfixes.
This update adds mitigations for various side channel attacks against
modern CPUs that could disclose content of otherwise unreadable memory
(bnc#1068032).
- CVE-2017-5753 / "SpecŧreAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring deep instruction pipelining could use attacker
controllable speculative execution over code patterns in the Linux
Kernel to leak content from otherwise not readable memory in the same
address space, allowing retrieval of passwords, cryptographic keys and
other secrets.
This problem is mitigated by adding speculative fencing on affected code
paths throughout the Linux kernel.
- CVE-2017-5715 / "SpectreAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring branch prediction could use mispredicted branches to
speculatively execute code patterns that in turn could be made to leak
other non-readable content in the same address space, an attack similar
to CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by disabling predictive branches, depending
on CPU architecture either by firmware updates and/or fixes in the
user-kernel privilege boundaries.
Please also check with your CPU / Hardware vendor on updated firmware
or BIOS images regarding this issue.
As this feature can have a performance impact, it can be disabled using
the "nospec" kernel commandline option.
- CVE-2017-5754 / "MeltdownAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring deep instruction pipelining could use code patterns in
userspace to speculative executive code that would read
otherwise read protected memory, an attack similar to CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by unmapping the Linux Kernel from the user
address space during user code execution, following a approach called
"KAISER". The terms used here are "KAISER" / "Kernel Address Isolation"
and "PTI" / "Page Table Isolation".
Note that this is only done on affected platforms.
This feature can be enabled / disabled by the "pti=[on|off|auto]" or
"nopti" commandline options.
Also the following unrelated security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-17806: The HMAC implementation (crypto/hmac.c) in the Linux
kernel did not validate that the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm
is unkeyed, allowing a local attacker able to use the AF\_ALG-based hash
interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_HASH) and the SHA-3 hash algorithm
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_SHA3) to cause a kernel stack buffer overflow by
executing a crafted sequence of system calls that encounter a missing
SHA-3 initialization (bnc#1073874).
- CVE-2017-17805: The Salsa20 encryption algorithm in the Linux kernel did
not correctly handle zero-length inputs, allowing a local attacker able
to use the AF\_ALG-based skcipher interface
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_SKCIPHER) to cause a denial of service
(uninitialized-memory free and kernel crash) or have unspecified other
impact by executing a crafted sequence of system calls that use the
blkcipher\_walk API. Both the generic implementation
(crypto/salsa20\_generic.c) and x86 implementation
(arch/x86/crypto/salsa20\_glue.c) of Salsa20 were vulnerable
(bnc#1073792).
The following non-security bugs were fixed:
- Add undefine \_unique\_build\_ids (bsc#964063)
- Always sign validate\_negotiate\_info reqs (bsc#1071009, fate#324404).
- apei / ERST: Fix missing error handling in erst\_reader() (bsc#1072556).
- arm: Hide finish\_arch\_post\_lock\_switch() from modules (bsc#1068032).
- autofs: fix careless error in recent commit (bnc#1012382 bsc#1065180).
- bpf: prevent speculative execution in eBPF interpreter (bnc#1068032).
- carl9170: prevent speculative execution (bnc#1068032).
- Check cmdline\_find\_option() retval properly and use boot\_cpu\_has().
- cw1200: prevent speculative execution (bnc#1068032).
- e1000e: Avoid receiver overrun interrupt bursts (bsc#969470 FATE#319819).
- e1000e: Fix e1000\_check\_for\_copper\_link\_ich8lan return value
(bsc#1073809).
- Fix leak of validate\_negotiate\_info resp (bsc#1071009, fate#324404).
- Fix NULL pointer deref in SMB2\_tcon() (bsc#1071009, fate#324404).
- Fix validate\_negotiate\_info uninitialized mem (bsc#1071009, fate#324404).
- fs: prevent speculative execution (bnc#1068032).
- genwqe: Take R/W permissions into account when dealing with memory pages
(bsc#1073090).
- ibmvnic: Include header descriptor support for ARP packets (bsc#1073912).
- ibmvnic: Increase maximum number of RX/TX queues (bsc#1073912).
- ibmvnic: Rename IBMVNIC\_MAX\_TX\_QUEUES to IBMVNIC\_MAX\_QUEUES
(bsc#1073912).
- ipv6: prevent speculative execution (bnc#1068032).
- kaiser: add "nokaiser" boot option, using ALTERNATIVE.
- kaiser: align addition to x86/mm/Makefile.
- kaiser: asm/tlbflush.h handle noPGE at lower level.
- kaiser: cleanups while trying for gold link.

Package        : linux
Version        : 3.2.96-3
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-5754 CVE-2017-17558 CVE-2017-17741 CVE-2017-17805
                 CVE-2017-17806 CVE-2017-17807

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5754

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel
    processors, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged
    process to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in
    the Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set
    named Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete
    separation of the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing
    the attack. This solution might have a performance impact, and can
    be disabled at boot time by passing `pti=off' to the kernel
    command line.

CVE-2017-17558

    Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly
    handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17741

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-17805

    It was discovered that some implementations of the Salsa20 block
    cipher did not correctly handle zero-length input.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
    have other security impact.

CVE-2017-17806

    It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with
    an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not
    intended.  A local user could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-17807

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for
    write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to
    obtain sensitive information.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.96-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Yesterday the security community and a number of IT vendors announced the existence of several hardware security vulnerabilities that allow potential exploits across a range of hardware architectures and operating systems including but not limited to Linux.

<https://meltdownattack.com/>

SUSE engineers have been collaborating with our partners and the Linux community on upstream Linux kernel patches. As a result of that collaboration, we are now able to release patches for most recent SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) versions. Additional patches for other SLE versions and environments will follow shortly.

Up to date information on all the patches available will be continually posted here on this [Technical Information Document page](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7022512).

Additional details on specific vulnerabilities will be posted here in CVE reports:

<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5753/>

<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5715/>

<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5754/>

Due to the nature of this issue, applying the maintenance updates will require a reboot of the operating system.

As research on these issues continues across the industry, additional optimizations and information may emerge and we will provide continually updated details here in this blog and on the pages referenced above.

We would like to thank all those in the upstream Linux Kernel Community whose passion, dedication and collaboration were critical to addressing these issues.

For further details, please contact your SUSE support representative.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

### Overview

Red Hat Customer Portal Labs provides a [Spectre And Meltdown Detector](https://access.redhat.com/labs/speculativeexecution/) to help you detect if your systems are vulnerable to these flaws.

The recent speculative execution CVEs address three potential attack vectors across a wide variety of processor architectures and platforms. Each platform requiring slightly different fixes. In many cases these fixes also require matching microcode updates provided by hardware vendors.

The security vulnerabilities described in these three CVEs may be found in modern microprocessors and operating systems on major hardware platforms including x86 (Intel and AMD chipsets), System Z, Power and ARM.

Red Hat has made updated kernels available to address these security vulnerabilities. These patches are enabled by default because Red Hat prioritizes out of the box security. Speculative execution is a performance optimization technique which these updates change (both kernel and microcode) and may result in workload-specific performance degradation.

Some customers who feel confident that their systems are well protected may wish to disable some or all of protection mechanisms. If the system administrator wishes elects to enable the protection mechanisms in the interest of security, this article provides a method to conduct performance characterizations with and without the fixes enabled.

#### Retpoline Kernels

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions up through RHEL-7.6, Red Hat uses “retpoline” code sequences for indirect branches in the kernel to isolate those branches from speculative execution. In those OS releases, for Intel processors prior to Skylake, retpolines are used instead of the ibrs feature for mitigation against Spectre variant 2. For Skylake, ibrs is used instead of retpolines.

With the upcoming Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 release, it is planned that all new installations on all Intel processors up through and

including Skylake will default to use retpolines. However updates from versions from RHEL 7.6, and before, to RHEL-7.7, and later, will preserve the existing Spectre variant 2 mitigation methods that were in place before the upgrade.

Any updated system that is using ibrs can be switched from using ibrs to retpolines at any time simply by adding the "spectre\_v2=retpoline" flag to the kernel boot command line.

A patched GCC compiler with Retpoline support is required for compiling the Retpoline patched kernel and third party modules. Any third party kernel module supplied prior to the update will require recompiling from source. SystemTap is one example that uses kernel modules to run code in kernel space, so it also needs the patched compiler. Please contact your software provider of the kernel module and request an update if the kernel module fails to work correctly.

#### Disabling the protection mechanisms:

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernels on x86, three debugfs tunables control the behaviour of the various patches in the updated kernel. These patches require updated microcode, which can be obtained from the hardware platform providers.

These debugfs tunables can be enabled or disabled on the kernel command line at boot or at runtime via debugfs controls. The tunables control Page Table Isolation (pti), Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (ibrs), and retpolines (retp). Depending on the CPU type, Red Hat enables each of these features by default as needed to protect the architecture detected at boot.

For those wanting to disable the security mitigation for these protection mechanisms to recover lost performance, the changes can be set at run time or persistently across reboots.

#### Persistently disable - Effective across a reboot

The first option is to disable them via the kernel command line by adding these flags, then reboot the kernel to have them take effect: There are several flags available to do this, noted below.

```
spectre_v2=off nopti

# For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
nospectre_v2 nopti

```

**Note:** you can individually disable each parameter, for performance characterization it is not required that all be simultaneously disabled.

Red Hat recommends using 'grubby' to manage these changes. See the [Systems Adminstrators guide section on grubby](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/sec-making_persistent_changes_to_a_grub_2_menu_using_the_grubby_tool)  for how to use this tool effectively.

#### Runtime disable - Does not persist through a reboot

The second option is to disable them at runtime with the following three commands. The change is immediately active and does not require a reboot.

```
# echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/x86/pti_enabled
# echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/x86/retp_enabled
# echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/x86/ibrs_enabled

```

Note this requires that the debugfs filesystem be mounted. In addition, the above "retp\_enabled" alteration is only available at runtime for RHEL7 systems. This tunable is read-only for RHEL 6 systems. In RHEL 7 the debugfs is mounted by default. In RHEL 6 you can mount it manually with the command:

```
# mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug

```
#### Verifying changes

To verify the fixes for these CVEs are correctly disabled, check the contents of the three files to verify their values are all set to 0.

```
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/x86/pti_enabled
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/x86/retp_enabled
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/x86/ibrs_enabled

```

Some applications may still see a small performance loss even with the above CVE flags disabled.

### Details:

The rest of this article describes more specifics about each CVE variant.

* **[CVE-2017-5753](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5753) (variant #1/Spectre)** is a Bounds-checking exploit during branching. This issue is fixed with a kernel patch. Variant #1 protection is always enabled; it is not possible to disable the patches. Red Hat’s performance testing for variant #1 did not show any measurable impact.
* **[CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5715) (variant #2/Spectre)** is an indirect branching poisoning attack that can lead to data leakage. This attack allows for a virtualized guest to read memory from the host system. This issue is corrected with microcode, along with kernel and virtualization updates to both guest and host virtualization software. This vulnerability requires both updated microcode and kernel patches. Variant #2 behavior is controlled by the ibrs tunable which work in conjunction with the microcode, or the retp tunable. The ibpb tunable is still visible, but now read-only and is set by the kernel.
* **[CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754) (variant #3/Meltdown)** is an exploit that uses speculative cache loading to allow a local attacker to be able to read the contents of memory. This issue is corrected with kernel patches. Variant #3 behavior is controlled by the pti tunable (nopti/pti\_enabled).

As noted, installing the microcode update for your hardware, if provided by the hardware vendor, is necessary to protect against variant 2. Please contact your hardware vendor for microcode updates.

#### Page Table Isolation (pti)

"nopti"/pti\_enabled controls the Kernel Page Table Isolation feature, which isolates kernel pagetables when running in userland. This feature addresses [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754), also called variant #3 (Meltdown)

Customers and vendors can disable the PTI feature by passing "nopti" to the kernel command line at boot, or dynamically with the runtime debugfs control below:

```
# echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/x86/pti_enabled

```
#### Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (ibrs)

The "noibrs"/ibrs\_enabled controls the IBRS feature in the SPEC\_CTRL model-specific register (MSR) when SPEC\_CTRL is present in cpuid (post microcode update). When ibrs\_enabled is set to 1 (spectre\_v2=ibrs) the kernel runs with indirect branch restricted speculation, which protects the kernel space from attacks (even from hyperthreading/simultaneous multi-threading attacks). When IBRS is set to 2 (spectre\_v2=ibrs\_always), both userland and kernel runs with indirect branch restricted speculation. This protects userspace from hyperthreading/simultaneous multi-threading attacks as well, and is also the default on certain old AMD processors (family 10h, 12h and 16h). This feature addresses [CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5715), variant #2.

When ibrs\_enabled is set to 3, only userland runs with indirect branch restricted speculation. This can be used in combination with retpoline (spectre\_v2=retpoline,ibrs\_user) to provide similar security to ibrs\_always with less performance overhead.

The ibrs implementation can be disabled in microcode by passing "noibrs" to the kernel command line at boot, or dynamically with the debugfs control below:

```
# echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/x86/ibrs_enabled

```
#### Indirect Branch Prediction Barriers (ibpb)

**Note:** The ibpb tuning knob is now read-only and will be set by the kernel if either ibrs or retp is set. As with ibrs, ibpb needs updated microcode in order to work (and be set) correctly.

Ibpb controls the IBPB feature in the PRED\_CMD model-specific register (MSR) if either IBPB\_SUPPORT or SPEC\_CTRL is present in cpuid (post microcode update). When ibpb\_enabled is set to 1, an IBPB barrier that flushes the contents of the indirect branch prediction is run across user mode or guest mode context switches to prevent user and guest mode from attacking other applications or virtual machines on the same host. In order to protect virtual machines from other virtual machines, ibpb\_enabled=1 is needed even if ibrs\_enabled is set to 2. This feature addresses [CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5715), variant #2.

### Architectural Defaults

By default, the appropriate tunables that apply to an architecture will be enabled automatically at boot time, based upon the architecture detected. Per Intel's guidance, (https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/api-app/sites/default/files/Retpoline-A-Branch-Target-Injection-Mitigation.pdf), both retpolines and IBRS are mitigations for Spectre variant 2. Retpolines will likely have a reduced performance impact.

> **Red Hat Enterprise Linux defaults on Intel CPUs:**

Listed below are configurations that the kernel would default to assuming no kernel command line parameters are provided.

For all pre-Skylake CPUs, and for Skylake with new Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 installations and beyond:

> > pti=1 ibrs=0 retp=1 ibpb=1-> mitigates variant #2 #3

For Skylake CPUs for RHEL installations prior to RHEL-7.7:

> > pti=1 ibrs=1 retp=0 ibpb=1-> fix variant#1 #2 #3

For older Intel systems with no microcode update available:

> > pti=1 retp=1 ibrs=0 ibpb=0 -> fix variant#1 #3
>
> **Red Hat Enterprise Linux defaults on AMD CPUs:**
>
> Due to the differences in underlying hardware implementation, AMD X86 systems are not vulnerable to variant #3. The correct default values will be set on AMD hardware based on dynamic checks during the boot sequence.
>
> > pti=0 ibrs=0 ibpb=1 retp=1 -> fix variant #1 #2 if the microcode update is applied
> >
> > pti=0 ibrs=2 ibpb=1 retp=1 -> fix variant #1 #2 on older processors that can disable indirect branch prediction without microcode updates
>
> **Note:** A microcode patch provided by the vendor must be applied in order for the tunables to be visible.
>
> **s390x Defaults**
>
> s390x is affected by Spectre (Variants 1 and 2), but not by Meltdown (Variant 3).
>
> > The mitigation for variant 1 (ppa15) is always active if the feature is available in microcode. It cannot be switched on/off dynamically, you can only disable instruction patching completely via the kernel parameter `noaltinstr`.
> >
> > For variant 2, mitigation is done via the `bpb` feature. As for ppa15, it is always active if the feature is available in microcode. It cannot be switched on/off dynamically either, but there is a kernel parameter `nobp` enabled by default which can be disabled with the `nobp=off` kernel parameter. (This patch uses a 'big hammer' approach, which has measurable performance impact).
>
> **IBM POWER Defaults**
>
> The mitigation for Spectre (Variants 1 and 2) are provided by the system firmware provided by the vendor. Currently there is no tunable available on Linux to disable these mitigations. The mitigation for variant 3 is provided by the Linux kernel, without depending on system firmware (although an optimized implementation is used in case system firmware provides support for it). It is enabled by default, and can be disabled on boot time, with the kernel command line parameters `no_rfi_flush` or `nopti`), or at run time, with either of the following tunables:
>
> > On initial zstream/errate updates:
> >
> > `/sys/devices/system/cpu/rfi_flush`
> >
> > The above tunable will change with upcoming zstream/errata updates to the following:
> >
> > `/sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/rfi_flush`

### Tuned for automation

Customers may control these settings by adding the above mentioned tuning commands to a customized tuned-adm profile via this method:

> [How to create a customized tuned profile](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1305833)

**Note** that these security fixes for variants #1 #2 #3 are enabled by default. Therefore creating a custom tuned profile is only required if the user intends to disable the security fixes.

                 CVE-2017-16939 CVE-2017-17448 CVE-2017-17449 CVE-2017-17450

                 CVE-2017-17807 CVE-2017-1000407 CVE-2017-1000410

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5754

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel
    processors, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged
    process to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in
    the Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set
    named Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete
    separation of the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing
    the attack. This solution might have a performance impact, and can
    be disabled at boot time by passing `pti=off' to the kernel
    command line.

CVE-2017-8824

    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false

CVE-2017-15868

    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol
    (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of the second
    socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to
    memory corruption.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16538

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media driver
    did not correctly handle some error conditions during
    initialisation.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16939

    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam
    Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec (xfrm) implementation
    did not correctly handle some failure cases when dumping policy
    information through netlink.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17448

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace, not
    just the root namespace, to enable and disable connection tracking
    helpers.  This could lead to denial of service, violation of
    network security policy, or have other impact.

CVE-2017-17449

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace
    to monitor netlink traffic in all net namespaces, not just
    those owned by that user namespace.  This could lead to
    exposure of sensitive information.

CVE-2017-17450

    Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt_osf module allowed users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace to modify
    the global OS fingerprint list.

CVE-2017-17558

    Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly
    handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-17741

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-17805

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-17806

    It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with
    an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not
    intended.  A local user could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-17807

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for
    write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to
    obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2017-1000407

    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.

CVE-2017-1000410

    Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not correctly
    handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP messages.  An
    attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.51-3+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE ID         : CVE-2017-5715 CVE-2017-5754 CVE-2017-13166 CVE-2018-5750

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may
lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running on
    the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch target
    injection) and is mitigated in the Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64
    architecture by using the 'retpoline' compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-5754

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel
    processors, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to
    read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from the kernel and all
    other processes running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the
    Linux kernel on the powerpc/ppc64el architectures by flushing the L1
    data cache on exit from kernel mode to user mode (or from hypervisor to
    kernel).

    This works on Power7, Power8 and Power9 processors.

CVE-2017-13166

    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 IOCTL handling code
    has been found. Memory protections ensuring user-provided buffers always
    point to userland memory were disabled, allowing . This bug could be
    exploited by an attacker to overwrite kernel memory from an unprivileged
    userland process, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5750

    An information leak has been found in the Linux kernel. The
    acpi_smbus_hc_add() prints a kernel address in the kernel log at every
    boot, which could be used by an attacker on the system to defeat kernel
    ASLR.

Additionnaly to those vulnerability, some mitigations for CVE-2017-5753 are
included in this release.

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running on
    the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1 (bounds-check
    bypass) and is mitigated in the Linux kernel architecture by identifying
    vulnerable code sections (array bounds checking followed by array
    access) and replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.82-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Red Hat has been made aware of multiple microarchitectural (hardware) implementation issues affecting many modern microprocessors, requiring updates to the Linux kernel, virtualization-related components, and/or in combination with a microcode update.  An unprivileged attacker can use these flaws to bypass conventional memory security restrictions in order to gain read access to privileged memory that would otherwise be inaccessible. There are 3 known CVEs related to this issue in combination with Intel, AMD, and ARM architectures. Additional exploits for other architectures are also known to exist. These include IBM System Z,  POWER8 (Big Endian and Little Endian), and POWER9 (Little Endian).

## Background Information

An industry-wide issue was found with the manner in which many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. All three rely upon the fact that modern high performance microprocessors implement both speculative execution, and utilize VIPT (Virtually Indexed, Physically Tagged) level 1 data caches that may become allocated with data in the kernel virtual address space during such speculation.

The first two variants abuse speculative execution to perform bounds-check bypass ([CVE-2017-5753](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5753)), or by utilizing branch target injection ([CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5715)) to cause kernel code at an address under attacker control to execute speculatively. Collectively these are known as "Spectre".  Both variants rely upon the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code, as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor’s level 1 data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire).  As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use these two flaws to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. These variants could be used not only to cross syscall boundary (variant 1 and variant 2) but also guest/host boundary (variant 2).

The third variant ([CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754)) relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. Researchers have called this exploit "Meltdown".  Subsequent memory accesses may cause an allocation into the L1 data cache even when they reference otherwise inaccessible memory locations. As a result, an unprivileged local attacker could read privileged (kernel space) memory (including arbitrary physical memory locations on a host) by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.

### Acknowledgements

Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting these flaws.

While Red Hat's Linux Containers are not directly impacted by kernel issues, their security relies upon the integrity of the host kernel environment. Red Hat recommends that you use the most recent versions of your container images. The Container Health Index, part of the [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/), can always be used to verify the security status of Red Hat containers. To protect the privacy of the containers in use, you will need to ensure that the Container host (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or [Atomic Host](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/enterprise-linux-atomic-host-datasheet)) has been updated against these attacks. Red Hat has released an updated Atomic Host for this use case.

## Attack Description and Impact

The attacks described in this article abuse the speculative execution capability of modern high-performance microprocessors. Modern microprocessors implement a design optimization known as “Out-of-Order” (OoO) execution, meaning the microprocessor will begin to execute independent instructions as soon as their data dependencies become available (so-called “data flow” model) rather than always executing instructions in the literal order provided by the programmer through their application binary. The illusion of a sequential execution is maintained within the processor by means of various internal reordering structures that buffer these intermediate execution states of the processor and present the in-order results. Out-of-Order (OoO) Execution was originally invented by Robert Tomasulo in 1967 for use in the early IBM mainframe systems. In the intervening decades, it has become a standard feature of nearly all microprocessors.

An extension of the Out-of-Order execution model adds highly sophisticated branch prediction algorithms that aim to predict whether a given path (branch) of software code will be executed. A branch can be thought of as changing the flow of instructions being executed by the processor in response to an “if” statement of the form “if this, then do A, otherwise do B”. The condition upon which a branch is taken or not taken often depends upon data that may not immediately be available (for example, because it requires a load from slower RAM into the internal microprocessor cache hierarchy). Since the branch condition may not be ready in a timely manner, the processor may begin to speculatively execute the most likely path, based on input from the branch predictor. Results from this execution are stored in such a manner that the entire path can be discarded if the speculated branch direction later turns out to be incorrect. Thus, speculative execution is normally completely invisible to the programmer, or to other users of the same system.

The attacks described in this article rely upon breaking open the black box that is the internal state of the microprocessor during speculative execution. In particular, the attacks rely upon a technique known as cache side-channel analysis. During speculative execution, a processor will not intermediately make results available in memory or registers visible to the programmer, to other processors, or to other running applications. Yet, in order to access memory within speculated code paths, it must bring the data in the processor cache. Side-channel analysis allows an attacker to observe speculated allocations (loads) into the system caches, even those coming from execution paths that ultimately have been discarded. A specially crafted program can then be designed to speculatively perform loads into the cache from privileged memory locations, and monitor the results which can be used to infer the content of that privileged memory.

One case that triggers CPU speculative execution is branches. An attacker can start by training the branch predictor that a particular branch in kernel code is heavily taken (or not taken). The next time the branch executes, the processor will start executing the code in the direction chosen by the attacker. If the attacker chooses a path that loads a value from memory, such load will be executed speculatively.  Attacks against branch prediction can (in some affected microprocessor implementations) be extended across the kernel/hypervisor boundary, allowing unprivileged guest Operating Systems to exert influence over the execution of the hypervisor and, when combined with side-channel analysis, to extract sensitive hypervisor memory.

The effects of speculative execution however can be even more wide-ranging. Because the internal state of the microprocessor is not visible to the programmer, or to other users or applications running on the system, the processor may perform speculative data accesses even before checking whether they are permitted. Permission checks will occur in parallel and ultimately trigger an abort of the speculation prior to retiring the speculated instructions and making their execution results visible outside the processor. If the processor speculatively uses cached data from memory prior to completing the permission checks, then it becomes possible to observe that data by using it in subsequent memory accesses.

One example of such permission checks is page access checks from the memory management unit (MMU). Paging, also known as virtual memory, is a common feature of high performance microprocessors; it lets the operating system control the mapping of virtual addresses into the physical addresses of the system RAM, and also limit accesses to the virtual addresses through access control bits. For example, a page can be marked as “read-only” (so that writes cause a page fault exception) or as “kernel memory” (so that user-mode accesses cause a page fault exception).

Because the processor’s permission checks enforce that user applications cannot access kernel memory, it is standard practice in the industry for operating system kernels (including Linux) to map kernel virtual memory addresses into the same address space as user applications. Doing so creates a significant performance advantage since applications make frequent use of kernel-provided system calls, and switching address spaces during each system call would incur a significant performance overhead. Each switch would require flushing (invalidating) the content of many internal CPU structures, such as TLBs (Translation Lookaside Buffers) that cache virtual-to-physical memory translations and accelerate the use of virtual memory.

Sharing the page tables between the kernel and user applications, however, enables another kind of attack against speculative execution. In this case, the preparatory phase has the attacker trick the kernel into loading an “interesting” virtual address into the processor’s Level 1 (L1) data cache. The L1 data cache is commonly organized using a technique known as VIPT (Virtually Indexed, Physically Tagged), which lets the virtual-to-physical address translation and permission checks occur in parallel with access. In the presence of a shared virtual address space, kernel privileged virtual addresses might be accessed speculatively through the L1 cache by untrusted user code during speculative execution, and the loaded values can be used further down the speculatively-executed path. A second speculative memory access can thus fill the cache in a manner that depends on privileged memory contents, and the effects can be observed to derive those contents.

These microprocessor side-channel attacks may allow an untrusted user with access to a machine to extract sensitive information from privileged kernel or hypervisor memory, as well as from other applications or virtual machines running on the same system. Mitigation involves a number of discrete steps, some or all of which may be required depending upon the exact make and model of the microprocessor, each of which may be vulnerable to a differing extent to each variant of the attack:

* **Separating the kernel and user virtual address spaces:** this is performed using a design change to the Operating System kernel known as KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation), sometimes referred to using the older name “KAISER”.
* **Disabling indirect branch prediction upon entry into the kernel or into the hypervisor:** New capabilities have been added to many microprocessors across the industry through microcode, millicode, firmware, and other updates. These new capabilities are leveraged by updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux which control their use.
* **Fencing speculative loads of certain memory locations:** Such loads have to be annotated through small changes to the Linux kernel, which have been integrated into Red Hat updates.

These software solutions, in combination with microcode, millicode, and firmware updates can mitigate the attacks described in this article. However, the mitigation comes at some cost to system performance. Depending upon the specific system, make, and model of the microprocessors, as well as the characteristics of the workloads, the performance impact can be significant. Red Hat is taking a proactive position that favors security over performance, while allowing users the flexibility to assess their own environment and make appropriate tradeoffs through selectively enabling and disabling the various mitigations.

The Red Hat Performance Engineering team has created a [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3307751) reporting observed performance impact for a variety of representative workloads, and describing options users can take to disable parts of the security fixes to regain the desired level of performance if the customer is confident their computers are physically isolated.  Additional performance data will be published as this incident develops.

The Red Hat Performance Engineering and Product Engineering teams have developed a [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3311301) detailing the tunables available to selectively enable or disable these new security features.

Red Hat customers running affected versions of the Red Hat products are strongly recommended to update them as soon as errata are available. Customers are urged to apply the appropriate updates immediately.  All impacted products should apply fixes to mitigate all 3 variants; [CVE-2017-5753](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5753) (variant 1),  [CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5715) (variant 2), and [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754) (variant 3).

**NOTES**

* Meltdown is the branded name for [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754) (variant 3)
* Spectre is the branded name for the combined [CVE-2017-5753](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5753) (variant 1) & [CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5715) (variant 2)
* Due to the nature of changes required, a **kpatch** for customers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 or greater will **NOT** be available.
* Variant 2 can be exploited both locally (within the same OS) and through the virtualization guest boundary. Fixes require CPU microcode/firmware to activate.  Subscribers are advised to contact their hardware OEM to receive the appropriate microcode/firmware for their processor.  An additional [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3436091) is available with more details.
* The errata for eligible releases that address [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754) (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6), [CVE-2017-5753](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5753) (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6) and [CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5715) (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6) do also include support for x86 32bit (i686) kernels.
* For customers using Red Hat OpenStack Platform, an additional [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3308531) is also available.
* For customers using Red Hat Satellite 6, an additional [Satellite 6 Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3320861) is also available. NOTE: Please use the table below to help quickly identify the specific RHSA ID's that you want to apply to your systems.

**[CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754) (variant 3, aka Meltdown) patches for 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**

Red Hat has no current plans to provide mitigations for the Meltdown vulnerability in 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environments.

Following many hours of engineering investigation and analysis, Red Hat has determined that introducing changes to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment would destabilize customer deployments and violate our  application binary interface (ABI) and kernel ABI commitments to customers who rely on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to be absolutely stable.

Although Red Hat has delivered patches to mitigate the Meltdown vulnerability in other supported product offerings, the 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment presents unique challenges.  The combination of limited address space in 32-bit environments plus the mechanism for passing control from the userspace to kernel and limitations on the stack during this transfer make the projected changes too invasive and disruptive for deployments that require the highest level of system stability.  By contrast, 32-bit Meltdown mitigations have been delivered for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, where the changes are far less invasive and risky.

## Mitigation

There is no known mitigation, other than applying vendor software updates combined with hardware OEMs CPU microcode/fiirmware. All Red Hat customers should apply vendor solutions to patch their CPUs, and update the kernel as soon as patches are available.

Customers are advised to take a risk-based approach in mitigating this issue.  Systems that require high degrees of security and trust should be addressed first, and should be isolated from untrusted systems until such time as treatments can be applied to those systems to reduce the risk of exploit.

Customers running Xen hypervisors should be aware of technical limitations of that software that cannot completely eliminate the variant 2 exploit, and cannot eliminate the variant 3 exploit on paravirtualized guests.  Red Hat has prepared a [Knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3307791) detailing the Xen situation and options available to Xen hypervisor users.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 74 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  70 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2650675.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2650675.1).

### Reading privileged memory with a side-channel

Posted by Jann Horn, Project Zero

We have discovered that CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts.

Variants of this issue are known to affect many modern processors, including certain processors by Intel, AMD and ARM. For a few Intel and AMD CPU models, we have exploits that work against real software. We reported this issue to Intel, AMD and ARM on 2017-06-01 [1].

So far, there are three known variants of the issue:

* Variant 1: bounds check bypass (CVE-2017-5753)
* Variant 2: branch target injection (CVE-2017-5715)
* Variant 3: rogue data cache load (CVE-2017-5754)

Before the issues described here were publicly disclosed, Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Yuval Yarom, Paul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Michael Schwarz, Mike Hamburg, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher and Werner Haas also reported them; their [writeups/blogposts/paper drafts] are at:

* [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf) (variants 1 and 2)
* [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf) (variant 3)

During the course of our research, we developed the following proofs of concept (PoCs):

1. A PoC that demonstrates the basic principles behind variant 1 in userspace on the tested Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, the AMD FX CPU, the AMD PRO CPU and an ARM Cortex A57 [2]. This PoC only tests for the ability to read data inside mis-speculated execution within the same process, without crossing any privilege boundaries.
2. A PoC for variant 1 that, when running with normal user privileges under a modern Linux kernel with a distro-standard config, can perform arbitrary reads in a 4GiB range [3] in kernel virtual memory on the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU. If the kernel's BPF JIT is enabled (non-default configuration), it also works on the AMD PRO CPU. On the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, kernel virtual memory can be read at a rate of around 2000 bytes per second after around 4 seconds of startup time. [4]
3. A PoC for variant 2 that, when running with root privileges inside a KVM guest created using virt-manager on the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, with a specific (now outdated) version of Debian's distro kernel [5] running on the host, can read host kernel memory at a rate of around 1500 bytes/second, with room for optimization. Before the attack can be performed, some initialization has to be performed that takes roughly between 10 and 30 minutes for a machine with 64GiB of RAM; the needed time should scale roughly linearly with the amount of host RAM. (If 2MB hugepages are available to the guest, the initialization should be much faster, but that hasn't been tested.)
4. A PoC for variant 3 that, when running with normal user privileges, can read kernel memory on the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU under some precondition. We believe that this precondition is that the targeted kernel memory is present in the L1D cache.

For interesting resources around this topic, look down into the "Literature" section.

A warning regarding explanations about processor internals in this blogpost: This blogpost contains a lot of speculation about hardware internals based on observed behavior, which might not necessarily correspond to what processors are actually doing.

We have some ideas on possible mitigations and provided some of those ideas to the processor vendors; however, we believe that the processor vendors are in a much better position than we are to design and evaluate mitigations, and we expect them to be the source of authoritative guidance.

The PoC code and the writeups that we sent to the CPU vendors are available here: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1272>.
# Tested Processors

* Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v3 @ 3.50GHz (called "Intel Haswell Xeon CPU" in the rest of this document)
* AMD FX(tm)-8320 Eight-Core Processor (called "AMD FX CPU" in the rest of this document)
* AMD PRO A8-9600 R7, 10 COMPUTE CORES 4C+6G (called "AMD PRO CPU" in the rest of this document)
* An ARM Cortex A57 core of a Google Nexus 5x phone [6] (called "ARM Cortex A57" in the rest of this document)

# Glossary

retire: An instruction retires when its results, e.g. register writes and memory writes, are committed and made visible to the rest of the system. Instructions can be executed out of order, but must always retire in order.

logical processor core: A logical processor core is what the operating system sees as a processor core. With hyperthreading enabled, the number of logical cores is a multiple of the number of physical cores.

cached/uncached data: In this blogpost, "uncached" data is data that is only present in main memory, not in any of the cache levels of the CPU. Loading uncached data will typically take over 100 cycles of CPU time.

speculative execution: A processor can execute past a branch without knowing whether it will be taken or where its target is, therefore executing instructions before it is known whether they should be executed. If this speculation turns out to have been incorrect, the CPU can discard the resulting state without architectural effects and continue execution on the correct execution path. Instructions do not retire before it is known that they are on the correct execution path.

mis-speculation window: The time window during which the CPU speculatively executes the wrong code and has not yet detected that mis-speculation has occurred.
# Variant 1: Bounds check bypass

This section explains the common theory behind all three variants and the theory behind our PoC for variant 1 that, when running in userspace under a Debian distro kernel, can perform arbitrary reads in a 4GiB region of kernel memory in at least the following configurations:

* Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, eBPF JIT is off (default state)
* Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, eBPF JIT is on (non-default state)
* AMD PRO CPU, eBPF JIT is on (non-default state)

The state of the eBPF JIT can be toggled using the net.core.bpf\_jit\_enable sysctl.
## Theoretical explanation

The [Intel Optimization Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf) says the following regarding Sandy Bridge (and later microarchitectural revisions) in section 2.3.2.3 ("Branch Prediction"):

Branch prediction predicts the branch target and enables the
processor to begin executing instructions long before the branch
true execution path is known.

In section 2.3.5.2 ("L1 DCache"):

Loads can:
[...]

* Be carried out speculatively, before preceding branches are resolved.
* Take cache misses out of order and in an overlapped manner.

Intel's Software Developer's Manual [7] states in Volume 3A, section 11.7 ("Implicit Caching (Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, and P6 family processors"):

Implicit caching occurs when a memory element is made potentially cacheable, although the element may never have been accessed in the normal von Neumann sequence. Implicit caching occurs on the P6 and more recent processor families due to aggressive prefetching, branch prediction, and TLB miss handling. Implicit caching is an extension of the behavior of existing Intel386, Intel486, and Pentium processor systems, since software running on these processor families also has not been able to deterministically predict the behavior of instruction prefetch.
Consider the code sample below. If arr1->length is uncached, the processor can speculatively load data from arr1->data[untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller]. This is an out-of-bounds read. That should not matter because the processor will effectively roll back the execution state when the branch has executed; none of the speculatively executed instructions will retire (e.g. cause registers etc. to be affected).

struct array {
  unsigned long length;
  unsigned char data[];
};
struct array \*arr1 = ...;
unsigned long untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller = ...;
if (untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller < arr1->length) {
  unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller];
  ...
}
However, in the following code sample, there's an issue. If arr1->length, arr2->data[0x200] and arr2->data[0x300] are not cached, but all other accessed data is, and the branch conditions are predicted as true, the processor can do the following speculatively before arr1->length has been loaded and the execution is re-steered:

* load value = arr1->data[untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller]
* start a load from a data-dependent offset in arr2->data, loading the corresponding cache line into the L1 cache

struct array {
  unsigned long length;
  unsigned char data[];
};
struct array \*arr1 = ...; /\* small array \*/
struct array \*arr2 = ...; /\* array of size 0x400 \*/
/\* >0x400 (OUT OF BOUNDS!) \*/
unsigned long untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller = ...;
if (untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller < arr1->length) {
  unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller];
  unsigned long index2 = ((value&1)\*0x100)+0x200;
  if (index2 < arr2->length) {
    unsigned char value2 = arr2->data[index2];
  }
}

After the execution has been returned to the non-speculative path because the processor has noticed that untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller is bigger than arr1->length, the cache line containing arr2->data[index2] stays in the L1 cache. By measuring the time required to load arr2->data[0x200] and arr2->data[0x300], an attacker can then determine whether the value of index2 during speculative execution was 0x200 or 0x300 - which discloses whether arr1->data[untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller]&1 is 0 or 1.

To be able to actually use this behavior for an attack, an attacker needs to be able to cause the execution of such a vulnerable code pattern in the targeted context with an out-of-bounds index. For this, the vulnerable code pattern must either be present in existing code, or there must be an interpreter or JIT engine that can be used to generate the vulnerable code pattern. So far, we have not actually identified any existing, exploitable instances of the vulnerable code pattern; the PoC for leaking kernel memory using variant 1 uses the eBPF interpreter or the eBPF JIT engine, which are built into the kernel and accessible to normal users.

A minor variant of this could be to instead use an out-of-bounds read to a function pointer to gain control of execution in the mis-speculated path. We did not investigate this variant further.
## Attacking the kernel

This section describes in more detail how variant 1 can be used to leak Linux kernel memory using the eBPF bytecode interpreter and JIT engine. While there are many interesting potential targets for variant 1 attacks, we chose to attack the Linux in-kernel eBPF JIT/interpreter because it provides more control to the attacker than most other JITs.

The Linux kernel supports eBPF since version 3.18. Unprivileged userspace code can supply bytecode to the kernel that is verified by the kernel and then:

* either interpreted by an in-kernel bytecode interpreter
* or translated to native machine code that also runs in kernel context using a JIT engine (which translates individual bytecode instructions without performing any further optimizations)

Execution of the bytecode can be triggered by attaching the eBPF bytecode to a socket as a filter and then sending data through the other end of the socket.

Whether the JIT engine is enabled depends on a run-time configuration setting - but at least on the tested Intel processor, the attack works independent of that setting.

Unlike classic BPF, eBPF has data types like data arrays and function pointer arrays into which eBPF bytecode can index. Therefore, it is possible to create the code pattern described above in the kernel using eBPF bytecode.

eBPF's data arrays are less efficient than its function pointer arrays, so the attack will use the latter where possible.

Both machines on which this was tested have no SMAP, and the PoC relies on that (but it shouldn't be a precondition in principle).

Additionally, at least on the Intel machine on which this was tested, bouncing modified cache lines between cores is slow, apparently because the MESI protocol is used for cache coherence [8]. Changing the reference counter of an eBPF array on one physical CPU core causes the cache line containing the reference counter to be bounced over to that CPU core, making reads of the reference counter on all other CPU cores slow until the changed reference counter has been written back to memory. Because the length and the reference counter of an eBPF array are stored in the same cache line, this also means that changing the reference counter on one physical CPU core causes reads of the eBPF array's length to be slow on other physical CPU cores (intentional false sharing).

The attack uses two eBPF programs. The first one tail-calls through a page-aligned eBPF function pointer array prog\_map at a configurable index. In simplified terms, this program is used to determine the address of prog\_map by guessing the offset from prog\_map to a userspace address and tail-calling through prog\_map at the guessed offsets. To cause the branch prediction to predict that the offset is below the length of prog\_map, tail calls to an in-bounds index are performed in between. To increase the mis-speculation window, the cache line containing the length of prog\_map is bounced to another core. To test whether an offset guess was successful, it can be tested whether the userspace address has been loaded into the cache.

Because such straightforward brute-force guessing of the address would be slow, the following optimization is used: 215 adjacent userspace memory mappings [9], each consisting of 24 pages, are created at the userspace address user\_mapping\_area, covering a total area of 231 bytes. Each mapping maps the same physical pages, and all mappings are present in the pagetables.

This permits the attack to be carried out in steps of 231 bytes. For each step, after causing an out-of-bounds access through prog\_map, only one cache line each from the first 24 pages of user\_mapping\_area have to be tested for cached memory. Because the L3 cache is physically indexed, any access to a virtual address mapping a physical page will cause all other virtual addresses mapping the same physical page to become cached as well.

When this attack finds a hit—a cached memory location—the upper 33 bits of the kernel address are known (because they can be derived from the address guess at which the hit occurred), and the low 16 bits of the address are also known (from the offset inside user\_mapping\_area at which the hit was found). The remaining part of the address of user\_mapping\_area is the middle.

The remaining bits in the middle can be determined by bisecting the remaining address space: Map two physical pages to adjacent ranges of virtual addresses, each virtual address range the size of half of the remaining search space, then determine the remaining address bit-wise.

At this point, a second eBPF program can be used to actually leak data. In pseudocode, this program looks as follows:

uint64\_t bitmask = <runtime-configurable>;
uint64\_t bitshift\_selector = <runtime-configurable>;
uint64\_t prog\_array\_base\_offset = <runtime-configurable>;
uint64\_t secret\_data\_offset = <runtime-configurable>;
// index will be bounds-checked by the runtime,
// but the bounds check will be bypassed speculatively
uint64\_t secret\_data = bpf\_map\_read(array=victim\_array, index=secret\_data\_offset);
// select a single bit, move it to a specific position, and add the base offset
uint64\_t progmap\_index = (((secret\_data & bitmask) >> bitshift\_selector) << 7) + prog\_array\_base\_offset;
bpf\_tail\_call(prog\_map, progmap\_index);

This program reads 8-byte-aligned 64-bit values from an eBPF data array "victim\_map" at a runtime-configurable offset and bitmasks and bit-shifts the value so that one bit is mapped to one of two values that are 27 bytes apart (sufficient to not land in the same or adjacent cache lines when used as an array index). Finally it adds a 64-bit offset, then uses the resulting value as an offset into prog\_map for a tail call.

This program can then be used to leak memory by repeatedly calling the eBPF program with an out-of-bounds offset into victim\_map that specifies the data to leak and an out-of-bounds offset into prog\_map that causes prog\_map + offset to point to a userspace memory area. Misleading the branch prediction and bouncing the cache lines works the same way as for the first eBPF program, except that now, the cache line holding the length of victim\_map must also be bounced to another core.
# Variant 2: Branch target injection

This section describes the theory behind our PoC for variant 2 that, when running with root privileges inside a KVM guest created using virt-manager on the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, with a specific version of Debian's distro kernel running on the host, can read host kernel memory at a rate of around 1500 bytes/second.
## Basics

Prior research (see the Literature section at the end) has shown that it is possible for code in separate security contexts to influence each other's branch prediction. So far, this has only been used to infer information about where code is located (in other words, to create interference from the victim to the attacker); however, the basic hypothesis of this attack variant is that it can also be used to redirect execution of code in the victim context (in other words, to create interference from the attacker to the victim; the other way around).

The basic idea for the attack is to target victim code that contains an indirect branch whose target address is loaded from memory and flush the cache line containing the target address out to main memory. Then, when the CPU reaches the indirect branch, it won't know the true destination of the jump, and it won't be able to calculate the true destination until it has finished loading the cache line back into the CPU, which takes a few hundred cycles. Therefore, there is a time window of typically over 100 cycles in which the CPU will speculatively execute instructions based on branch prediction.
## Haswell branch prediction internals

Some of the internals of the branch prediction implemented by Intel's processors have already been published; however, getting this attack to work properly required significant further experimentation to determine additional details.

This section focuses on the branch prediction internals that were experimentally derived from the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU.

Haswell seems to have multiple branch prediction mechanisms that work very differently:

* A generic branch predictor that can only store one target per source address; used for all kinds of jumps, like absolute jumps, relative jumps and so on.
* A specialized indirect call predictor that can store multiple targets per source address; used for indirect calls.
* (There is also a specialized return predictor, according to Intel's optimization manual, but we haven't analyzed that in detail yet. If this predictor could be used to reliably dump out some of the call stack through which a VM was entered, that would be very interesting.)

### Generic predictor

The generic branch predictor, as documented in prior research, only uses the lower 31 bits of the address of the last byte of the source instruction for its prediction. If, for example, a branch target buffer (BTB) entry exists for a jump from 0x4141.0004.1000 to 0x4141.0004.5123, the generic predictor will also use it to predict a jump from 0x4242.0004.1000. When the higher bits of the source address differ like this, the higher bits of the predicted destination change together with it—in this case, the predicted destination address will be 0x4242.0004.5123—so apparently this predictor doesn't store the full, absolute destination address.

Before the lower 31 bits of the source address are used to look up a BTB entry, they are folded together using XOR. Specifically, the following bits are folded together:

| bit A | bit B |
| --- | --- |
| 0x40.0000 | 0x2000 |
| 0x80.0000 | 0x4000 |
| 0x100.0000 | 0x8000 |
| 0x200.0000 | 0x1.0000 |
| 0x400.0000 | 0x2.0000 |
| 0x800.0000 | 0x4.0000 |
| 0x2000.0000 | 0x10.0000 |
| 0x4000.0000 | 0x20.0000 |

In other words, if a source address is XORed with both numbers in a row of this table, the branch predictor will not be able to distinguish the resulting address from the original source address when performing a lookup. For example, the branch predictor is able to distinguish source addresses 0x100.0000 and 0x180.0000, and it can also distinguish source addresses 0x100.0000 and 0x180.8000, but it can't distinguish source addresses 0x100.0000 and 0x140.2000 or source addresses 0x100.0000 and 0x180.4000. In the following, this will be referred to as aliased source addresses.

When an aliased source address is used, the branch predictor will still predict the same target as for the unaliased source address. This indicates that the branch predictor stores a truncated absolute destination address, but that hasn't been verified.

Based on observed maximum forward and backward jump distances for different source addresses, the low 32-bit half of the target address could be stored as an absolute 32-bit value with an additional bit that specifies whether the jump from source to target crosses a 232 boundary; if the jump crosses such a boundary, bit 31 of the source address determines whether the high half of the instruction pointer should increment or decrement.
### Indirect call predictor

The inputs of the BTB lookup for this mechanism seem to be:

* The low 12 bits of the address of the source instruction (we are not sure whether it's the address of the first or the last byte) or a subset of them.
* The branch history buffer state.

If the indirect call predictor can't resolve a branch, it is resolved by the generic predictor instead. Intel's optimization manual hints at this behavior: "Indirect Calls and Jumps. These may either be predicted as having a monotonic target or as having targets that vary in accordance with recent program behavior."

The branch history buffer (BHB) stores information about the last 29 taken branches - basically a fingerprint of recent control flow - and is used to allow better prediction of indirect calls that can have multiple targets.

The update function of the BHB works as follows (in pseudocode; src is the address of the last byte of the source instruction, dst is the destination address):

void bhb\_update(uint58\_t \*bhb\_state, unsigned long src, unsigned long dst) {
  \*bhb\_state <<= 2;
  \*bhb\_state ^= (dst & 0x3f);
  \*bhb\_state ^= (src & 0xc0) >> 6;
  \*bhb\_state ^= (src & 0xc00) >> (10 - 2);
  \*bhb\_state ^= (src & 0xc000) >> (14 - 4);
  \*bhb\_state ^= (src & 0x30) << (6 - 4);
  \*bhb\_state ^= (src & 0x300) << (8 - 8);
  \*bhb\_state ^= (src & 0x3000) >> (12 - 10);
  \*bhb\_state ^= (src & 0x30000) >> (16 - 12);
  \*bhb\_state ^= (src & 0xc0000) >> (18 - 14);
}

Some of the bits of the BHB state seem to be folded together further using XOR when used for a BTB access, but the precise folding function hasn't been understood yet.

The BHB is interesting for two reasons. First, knowledge about its approximate behavior is required in order to be able to accurately cause collisions in the indirect call predictor. But it also permits dumping out the BHB state at any repeatable program state at which the attacker can execute code - for example, when attacking a hypervisor, directly after a hypercall. The dumped BHB state can then be used to fingerprint the hypervisor or, if the attacker has access to the hypervisor binary, to determine the low 20 bits of the hypervisor load address (in the case of KVM: the low 20 bits of the load address of kvm-intel.ko).
### Reverse-Engineering Branch Predictor Internals

This subsection describes how we reverse-engineered the internals of the Haswell branch predictor. Some of this is written down from memory, since we didn't keep a detailed record of what we were doing.

We initially attempted to perform BTB injections into the kernel using the generic predictor, using the knowledge from prior research that the generic predictor only looks at the lower half of the source address and that only a partial target address is stored. This kind of worked - however, the injection success rate was very low, below 1%. (This is the method we used in our preliminary PoCs for method 2 against modified hypervisors running on Haswell.)

We decided to write a userspace test case to be able to more easily test branch predictor behavior in different situations.

Based on the assumption that branch predictor state is shared between hyperthreads [10], we wrote a program of which two instances are each pinned to one of the two logical processors running on a specific physical core, where one instance attempts to perform branch injections while the other measures how often branch injections are successful. Both instances were executed with ASLR disabled and had the same code at the same addresses. The injecting process performed indirect calls to a function that accesses a (per-process) test variable; the measuring process performed indirect calls to a function that tests, based on timing, whether the per-process test variable is cached, and then evicts it using CLFLUSH. Both indirect calls were performed through the same callsite. Before each indirect call, the function pointer stored in memory was flushed out to main memory using CLFLUSH to widen the speculation time window. Additionally, because of the reference to "recent program behavior" in Intel's optimization manual, a bunch of conditional branches that are always taken were inserted in front of the indirect call.

In this test, the injection success rate was above 99%, giving us a base setup for future experiments.

We then tried to figure out the details of the prediction scheme. We assumed that the prediction scheme uses a global branch history buffer of some kind.

To determine the duration for which branch information stays in the history buffer, a conditional branch that is only taken in one of the two program instances was inserted in front of the series of always-taken conditional jumps, then the number of always-taken conditional jumps (N) was varied. The result was that for N=25, the processor was able to distinguish the branches (misprediction rate under 1%), but for N=26, it failed to do so (misprediction rate over 99%).
Therefore, the branch history buffer had to be able to store information about at least the last 26 branches.

The code in one of the two program instances was then moved around in memory. This revealed that only the lower 20 bits of the source and target addresses have an influence on the branch history buffer.

Testing with different types of branches in the two program instances revealed that static jumps, taken conditional jumps, calls and returns influence the branch history buffer the same way; non-taken conditional jumps don't influence it; the address of the last byte of the source instruction is the one that counts; IRETQ doesn't influence the history buffer state (which is useful for testing because it permits creating program flow that is invisible to the history buffer).

Moving the last conditional branch before the indirect call around in memory multiple times revealed that the branch history buffer contents can be used to distinguish many different locations of that last conditional branch instruction. This suggests that the history buffer doesn't store a list of small history values; instead, it seems to be a larger buffer in which history data is mixed together.

However, a history buffer needs to "forget" about past branches after a certain number of new branches have been taken in order to be useful for branch prediction. Therefore, when new data is mixed into the history buffer, this can not cause information in bits that are already present in the history buffer to propagate downwards - and given that, upwards combination of information probably wouldn't be very useful either. Given that branch prediction also must be very fast, we concluded that it is likely that the update function of the history buffer left-shifts the old history buffer, then XORs in the new state (see diagram).

If this assumption is correct, then the history buffer contains a lot of information about the most recent branches, but only contains as many bits of information as are shifted per history buffer update about the last branch about which it contains any data. Therefore, we tested whether flipping different bits in the source and target addresses of a jump followed by 32 always-taken jumps with static source and target allows the branch prediction to disambiguate an indirect call. [11]

With 32 static jumps in between, no bit flips seemed to have an influence, so we decreased the number of static jumps until a difference was observable. The result with 28 always-taken jumps in between was that bits 0x1 and 0x2 of the target and bits 0x40 and 0x80 of the source had such an influence; but flipping both 0x1 in the target and 0x40 in the source or 0x2 in the target and 0x80 in the source did not permit disambiguation. This shows that the per-insertion shift of the history buffer is 2 bits and shows which data is stored in the least significant bits of the history buffer. We then repeated this with decreased amounts of fixed jumps after the bit-flipped jump to determine which information is stored in the remaining bits.
## Reading host memory from a KVM guest

### Locating the host kernel

Our PoC locates the host kernel in several steps. The information that is determined and necessary for the next steps of the attack consists of:

* lower 20 bits of the address of kvm-intel.ko
* full address of kvm.ko
* full address of vmlinux

Looking back, this is unnecessarily complicated, but it nicely demonstrates the various techniques an attacker can use. A simpler way would be to first determine the address of vmlinux, then bisect the addresses of kvm.ko and kvm-intel.ko.

In the first step, the address of kvm-intel.ko is leaked. For this purpose, the branch history buffer state after guest entry is dumped out. Then, for every possible value of bits 12..19 of the load address of kvm-intel.ko, the expected lowest 16 bits of the history buffer are computed based on the load address guess and the known offsets of the last 8 branches before guest entry, and the results are compared against the lowest 16 bits of the leaked history buffer state.

The branch history buffer state is leaked in steps of 2 bits by measuring misprediction rates of an indirect call with two targets. One way the indirect call is reached is from a vmcall instruction followed by a series of N branches whose relevant source and target address bits are all zeroes. The second way the indirect call is reached is from a series of controlled branches in userspace that can be used to write arbitrary values into the branch history buffer.
Misprediction rates are measured as in the section "Reverse-Engineering Branch Predictor Internals", using one call target that loads a cache line and another one that checks whether the same cache line has been loaded.

With N=29, mispredictions will occur at a high rate if the controlled branch history buffer value is zero because all history buffer state from the hypercall has been erased. With N=28, mispredictions will occur if the controlled branch history buffer value is one of 0<<(28\*2), 1<<(28\*2), 2<<(28\*2), 3<<(28\*2) - by testing all four possibilities, it can be detected which one is right. Then, for decreasing values of N, the four possibilities are {0|1|2|3}<<(28\*2) | (history\_buffer\_for(N+1) >> 2). By repeating this for decreasing values for N, the branch history buffer value for N=0 can be determined.

At this point, the low 20 bits of kvm-intel.ko are known; the next step is to roughly locate kvm.ko.
For this, the generic branch predictor is used, using data inserted into the BTB by an indirect call from kvm.ko to kvm-intel.ko that happens on every hypercall; this means that the source address of the indirect call has to be leaked out of the BTB.

kvm.ko will probably be located somewhere in the range from 0xffffffffc0000000 to 0xffffffffc4000000, with page alignment (0x1000). This means that the first four entries in the table in the section "Generic Predictor" apply; there will be 24-1=15 aliasing addresses for the correct one. But that is also an advantage: It cuts down the search space from 0x4000 to 0x4000/24=1024.

To find the right address for the source or one of its aliasing addresses, code that loads data through a specific register is placed at all possible call targets (the leaked low 20 bits of kvm-intel.ko plus the in-module offset of the call target plus a multiple of 220) and indirect calls are placed at all possible call sources. Then, alternatingly, hypercalls are performed and indirect calls are performed through the different possible non-aliasing call sources, with randomized history buffer state that prevents the specialized prediction from working. After this step, there are 216 remaining possibilities for the load address of kvm.ko.

Next, the load address of vmlinux can be determined in a similar way, using an indirect call from vmlinux to kvm.ko. Luckily, none of the bits which are randomized in the load address of vmlinux  are folded together, so unlike when locating kvm.ko, the result will directly be unique. vmlinux has an alignment of 2MiB and a randomization range of 1GiB, so there are still only 512 possible addresses.
Because (as far as we know) a simple hypercall won't actually cause indirect calls from vmlinux to kvm.ko, we instead use port I/O from the status register of an emulated serial port, which is present in the default configuration of a virtual machine created with virt-manager.

The only remaining piece of information is which one of the 16 aliasing load addresses of kvm.ko is actually correct. Because the source address of an indirect call to kvm.ko is known, this can be solved using bisection: Place code at the various possible targets that, depending on which instance of the code is speculatively executed, loads one of two cache lines, and measure which one of the cache lines gets loaded.
### Identifying cache sets

The PoC assumes that the VM does not have access to hugepages.To discover eviction sets for all L3 cache sets with a specific alignment relative to a 4KiB page boundary, the PoC first allocates 25600 pages of memory. Then, in a loop, it selects random subsets of all remaining unsorted pages such that the expected number of sets for which an eviction set is contained in the subset is 1, reduces each subset down to an eviction set by repeatedly accessing its cache lines and testing whether the cache lines are always cached (in which case they're probably not part of an eviction set) and attempts to use the new eviction set to evict all remaining unsorted cache lines to determine whether they are in the same cache set [12].
### Locating the host-virtual address of a guest page

Because this attack uses a FLUSH+RELOAD approach for leaking data, it needs to know the host-kernel-virtual address of one guest page. Alternative approaches such as PRIME+PROBE should work without that requirement.

The basic idea for this step of the attack is to use a branch target injection attack against the hypervisor to load an attacker-controlled address and test whether that caused the guest-owned page to be loaded. For this, a gadget that simply loads from the memory location specified by R8 can be used - R8-R11 still contain guest-controlled values when the first indirect call after a guest exit is reached on this kernel build.

We expected that an attacker would need to either know which eviction set has to be used at this point or brute-force it simultaneously; however, experimentally, using random eviction sets works, too. Our theory is that the observed behavior is actually the result of L1D and L2 evictions, which might be sufficient to permit a few instructions worth of speculative execution.

The host kernel maps (nearly?) all physical memory in the physmap area, including memory assigned to KVM guests. However, the location of the physmap is randomized (with a 1GiB alignment), in an area of size 128PiB. Therefore, directly bruteforcing the host-virtual address of a guest page would take a long time. It is not necessarily impossible; as a ballpark estimate, it should be possible within a day or so, maybe less, assuming 12000 successful injections per second and 30 guest pages that are tested in parallel; but not as impressive as doing it in a few minutes.

To optimize this, the problem can be split up: First, brute-force the physical address using a gadget that can load from physical addresses, then brute-force the base address of the physmap region. Because the physical address can usually be assumed to be far below 128PiB, it can be brute-forced more efficiently, and brute-forcing the base address of the physmap region afterwards is also easier because then address guesses with 1GiB alignment can be used.

To brute-force the physical address, the following gadget can be used:

ffffffff810a9def:       4c 89 c0                mov    rax,r8
ffffffff810a9df2:       4d 63 f9                movsxd r15,r9d
ffffffff810a9df5:       4e 8b 04 fd c0 b3 a6    mov    r8,QWORD PTR [r15\*8-0x7e594c40]
ffffffff810a9dfc:       81
ffffffff810a9dfd:       4a 8d 3c 00             lea    rdi,[rax+r8\*1]
ffffffff810a9e01:       4d 8b a4 00 f8 00 00    mov    r12,QWORD PTR [r8+rax\*1+0xf8]
ffffffff810a9e08:       00

This gadget permits loading an 8-byte-aligned value from the area around the kernel text section by setting R9 appropriately, which in particular permits loading page\_offset\_base, the start address of the physmap. Then, the value that was originally in R8 - the physical address guess minus 0xf8 - is added to the result of the previous load, 0xfa is added to it, and the result is dereferenced.
### Cache set selection

To select the correct L3 eviction set, the attack from the following section is essentially executed with different eviction sets until it works.
### Leaking data

At this point, it would normally be necessary to locate gadgets in the host kernel code that can be used to actually leak data by reading from an attacker-controlled location, shifting and masking the result appropriately and then using the result of that as offset to an attacker-controlled address for a load. But piecing gadgets together and figuring out which ones work in a speculation context seems annoying. So instead, we decided to use the eBPF interpreter, which is built into the host kernel - while there is no legitimate way to invoke it from inside a VM, the presence of the code in the host kernel's text section is sufficient to make it usable for the attack, just like with ordinary ROP gadgets.

The eBPF interpreter entry point has the following function signature:

static unsigned int \_\_bpf\_prog\_run(void \*ctx, const struct bpf\_insn \*insn)

The second parameter is a pointer to an array of statically pre-verified eBPF instructions to be executed - which means that \_\_bpf\_prog\_run() will not perform any type checks or bounds checks. The first parameter is simply stored as part of the initial emulated register state, so its value doesn't matter.

The eBPF interpreter provides, among other things:

* multiple emulated 64-bit registers
* 64-bit immediate writes to emulated registers
* memory reads from addresses stored in emulated registers
* bitwise operations (including bit shifts) and arithmetic operations

To call the interpreter entry point, a gadget that gives RSI and RIP control given R8-R11 control and controlled data at a known memory location is necessary. The following gadget provides this functionality:

ffffffff81514edd:       4c 89 ce                mov    rsi,r9
ffffffff81514ee0:       41 ff 90 b0 00 00 00    call   QWORD PTR [r8+0xb0]

Now, by pointing R8 and R9 at the mapping of a guest-owned page in the physmap, it is possible to speculatively execute arbitrary unvalidated eBPF bytecode in the host kernel. Then, relatively straightforward bytecode can be used to leak data into the cache.
# Variant 3: Rogue data cache load

Basically, read Anders Fogh's blogpost: <https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/>

In summary, an attack using this variant of the issue attempts to read kernel memory from userspace without misdirecting the control flow of kernel code. This works by using the code pattern that was used for the previous variants, but in userspace. The underlying idea is that the permission check for accessing an address might not be on the critical path for reading data from memory to a register, where the permission check could have significant performance impact. Instead, the memory read could make the result of the read available to following instructions immediately and only perform the permission check asynchronously, setting a flag in the reorder buffer that causes an exception to be raised if the permission check fails.

We do have a few additions to make to Anders Fogh's blogpost:

"Imagine the following instruction executed in usermode
mov rax,[somekernelmodeaddress]
It will cause an interrupt when retired, [...]"

It is also possible to already execute that instruction behind a high-latency mispredicted branch to avoid taking a page fault. This might also widen the speculation window by increasing the delay between the read from a kernel address and delivery of the associated exception.

"First, I call a syscall that touches this memory. Second, I use the prefetcht0 instruction to improve my odds of having the address loaded in L1."

When we used prefetch instructions after doing a syscall, the attack stopped working for us, and we have no clue why. Perhaps the CPU somehow stores whether access was denied on the last access and prevents the attack from working if that is the case?

"Fortunately I did not get a slow read suggesting that Intel null’s the result when the access is not allowed."

That (read from kernel address returns all-zeroes) seems to happen for memory that is not sufficiently cached but for which pagetable entries are present, at least after repeated read attempts. For unmapped memory, the kernel address read does not return a result at all.
# Ideas for further research

We believe that our research provides many remaining research topics that we have not yet investigated, and we encourage other public researchers to look into these.
This section contains an even higher amount of speculation than the rest of this blogpost - it contains untested ideas that might well be useless.
## Leaking without data cache timing

It would be interesting to explore whether there are microarchitectural attacks other than measuring data cache timing that can be used for exfiltrating data out of speculative execution.
## Other microarchitectures

Our research was relatively Haswell-centric so far. It would be interesting to see details e.g. on how the branch prediction of other modern processors works and how well it can be attacked.
## Other JIT engines

We developed a successful variant 1 attack against the JIT engine built into the Linux kernel. It would be interesting to see whether attacks against more advanced JIT engines with less control over the system are also practical - in particular, JavaScript engines.
## More efficient scanning for host-virtual addresses and cache sets

In variant 2, while scanning for the host-virtual address of a guest-owned page, it might make sense to attempt to determine its L3 cache set first. This could be done by performing L3 evictions using an eviction pattern through the physmap, then testing whether the eviction affected the guest-owned page.

The same might work for cache sets - use an L1D+L2 eviction set to evict the function pointer in the host kernel context, use a gadget in the kernel to evict an L3 set using physical addresses, then use that to identify which cache sets guest lines belong to until a guest-owned eviction set has been constructed.
## Dumping the complete BTB state

Given that the generic BTB seems to only be able to distinguish 231-8 or fewer source addresses, it seems feasible to dump out the complete BTB state generated by e.g. a hypercall in a timeframe around the order of a few hours. (Scan for jump sources, then for every discovered jump source, bisect the jump target.) This could potentially be used to identify the locations of functions in the host kernel even if the host kernel is custom-built.

The source address aliasing would reduce the usefulness somewhat, but because target addresses don't suffer from that, it might be possible to correlate (source,target) pairs from machines with different KASLR offsets and reduce the number of candidate addresses based on KASLR being additive while aliasing is bitwise.

This could then potentially allow an attacker to make guesses about the host kernel version or the compiler used to build it based on jump offsets or distances between functions.
## Variant 2: Leaking with more efficient gadgets

If sufficiently efficient gadgets are used for variant 2, it might not be necessary to evict host kernel function pointers from the L3 cache at all; it might be sufficient to only evict them from L1D and L2.
## Various speedups

In particular the variant 2 PoC is still a bit slow. This is probably partly because:

* It only leaks one bit at a time; leaking more bits at a time should be doable.
* It heavily uses IRETQ for hiding control flow from the processor.

It would be interesting to see what data leak rate can be achieved using variant 2.
## Leaking or injection through the return predictor

If the return predictor also doesn't lose its state on a privilege level change, it might be useful for either locating the host kernel from inside a VM (in which case bisection could be used to very quickly discover the full address of the host kernel) or injecting return targets (in particular if the return address is stored in a cache line that can be flushed out by the attacker and isn't reloaded before the return instruction).

However, we have not performed any experiments with the return predictor that yielded conclusive results so far.
## Leaking data out of the indirect call predictor

We have attempted to leak target information out of the indirect call predictor, but haven't been able to make it work.
# Vendor statements

The following statement were provided to us regarding this issue from the vendors to whom Project Zero disclosed this vulnerability:
## Intel

Intel is committed to improving the overall security of computer systems. The methods described here rely on common properties of modern microprocessors. Thus, susceptibility to these methods is not limited to Intel processors, nor does it mean that a processor is working outside its intended functional specification. Intel is working closely with our ecosystem partners, as well as with other silicon vendors whose processors are affected, to design and distribute both software and hardware mitigations for these methods.

## AMD

AMD provided the following link: <http://www.amd.com/en/corporate/speculative-execution>
## ARM

Arm recognises that the speculation functionality of many modern high-performance processors, despite working as intended, can be used in conjunction with the timing of cache operations to leak some information as described in this blog. Correspondingly, Arm has developed software mitigations that we recommend be deployed.

Specific details regarding the affected processors and mitigations can be found at this website: <https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update>

Arm has included a detailed technical whitepaper as well as links to information from some of Arm’s architecture partners regarding their specific implementations and mitigations.

* <https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf>: Intel's optimization manual has many interesting pieces of optimization advice that hint at relevant microarchitectural behavior; for example:

+ "Placing data immediately following an indirect branch can cause a performance problem. If the data consists of all zeros, it looks like a long stream of ADDs to memory destinations and this can cause resource conflicts and slow down branch recovery. Also, data immediately following indirect branches may appear as branches to the branch predication [sic] hardware, which can branch off to execute other data pages. This can lead to subsequent self-modifying code problems."
+ "Loads can:[...]Be carried out speculatively, before preceding branches are resolved."
+ "Software should avoid writing to a code page in the same 1-KByte subpage that is being executed or fetching code in the same 2-KByte subpage of that is being written. In addition, sharing a page containing directly or speculatively executed code with another processor as a data page can trigger an SMC condition that causes the entire pipeline of the machine and the trace cache to be cleared. This is due to the self-modifying code condition."
+ "if mapped as WB or WT, there is a potential for speculative processor reads to bring the data into the caches"
+ "Failure to map the region as WC may allow the line to be speculatively read into the processor caches (via the wrong path of a mispredicted branch)."

     It looks like there are two different bugs and Intel is vulnerable to the one that is easiest to trigger.

     Folks,
     Sorry for the rookie question, but in order for any of the variant to be triggered, an "attacker" must first has either physical/remote access to the machine - correct? (in order to access the memory/root)

     Scenario b:
     Also, a similar approach may be utilized if a user has visited a malicious site and an attacker now has access to the browser-session and again other sessions running in parallel?

     Intel, AMD & all ARM processors that use speculative execution are all vulnerable to at least one of the 3 variants of the vulnerability. Intel is just the worst impacted due to meltdown being unique to them.

     No a rookie question, it is a good question, while there is a lot of hype about the exploits, there does not appear to be a clear simple explanation of how an attacker would use these exploits. I believe from what I read so far, this would have to be a targeted attack to gather the exploited information. If anyone has any other information please update us all.

     Out of pure curiosity because I used to work on both chips, I wonder if PowerPC (and Power) chips and Oracle's abandoned SPARC processors are also effected?

     AFAIK this is not a remote exploitable bug. You have to be able to run userspace (unprivileged) code on the machine. On the bad side, it seems that from inside a VM (eg. in a cloud service) you can read others VMs' memory.

     Anyway, all the hype mixing all processors together, mixing those 3 variants together, is just wrong. Only meltdown (the Intel-specific one, variant 3), can be used to \*accurately\* read memory. The other variants can only do a fair guess of the memory contents timing the cache access.

     Spectre could be used via the Browser (Firefox,Chrome, etc.) via a jvascript. In this scenario it would be possible for one tab to read the other tabs and things like the password you used for them. Thats why you should be aware that your Browser is up to date!
     This is just a simplified explanation.

     There is a PoC exploit of this in JavaScript - however I am not sure if it has been expanded on or exploited in any specific way. This means, though, that even visiting a webpage that is infected could gain the attacker access to your cache...

   So for AMD, this appears to only impact Linux and FreeBSD users using an "APU" who've manually turned on the BPF JIT. Considering I had no clue this thing existed until now, I'm going to guess this impacts all of 3 users.

     "The FreeBSD Security Team recently learned of the details of these
     issues that affect certain CPUs. Details could not be discussed
     publicly, but mitigation work is in progress.

     Work is ongoing to develop and commit these mitigations to the FreeBSD"

     So, if FreeBSD is not impacted, why are they doing mitigation work and applying patches?
     What you claim, doesn't seem to make any sense according to their statement?

   Yeah find it strange why amd is being singled out, when they are least affected in this, and not at all affected for meltdown, which is what all the performance hitting patches are for.

   (Not running amd cpus, but let’s be fair here)

   Would be nice to see some performance metrics out of the google datacenters with KPTI on/off..
   IMHO this could be a big problem for Intel, as enterprise customers will demand compensation from them.

     Never mind the future goodwill and trust impact on this one.
     The Pentium calculus bug was pretty bad for them, but this makes everything else pale in comparison, and if the performance losses are as big as an average of 20%, then someone will demand quite some comp for that.

     The spectre vulnerability seems to be more of a generic one, while bad, not as easy to actually do on a generic system where you don't know the current setup.

     As for mitigating that one, it looks like you may have to make cache lines private to the process, rather than a shared general global space.

   I'm glad to see that Project Zero is willing to extend their 90-day deadline when the defect owners need extra time.

     They always said: "As always, we reserve the right to bring deadlines forwards or backwards based on extreme circumstances. "

     I suspect three affected hardware vendors and nearly every OS vendors, it probably took them most of this time to notify everyone who needed to know.

    That AMD "is vulnerable" should NOT be believed for a single solitary nanosecond without empirical evidence of exploitation on AMD platforms. I could be wrong, but this WREAKS of Intel damage-control. That is to say, the "AMD is exploitable" line \_may\_ be an attempt to exploit human psychology in order to mitigate consumer-flight from Intel CPU's toward AMD's offering....

    Upon reading about the Intel bug and how AMD was not vulnerable (at first), the involuntary thought that immediately entered my own mind was "my next CPU is gonna be AMD. period." So what I'm saying is that in order to curb this rational impulse in consumers (given the severity of the bug), there MAY be a "push" to vilify AMD's chips to instill the feeling of "oh well, if they both have serious bugs, I may as well stay with what I'm using on my next purchase".

      Everyone with a bit of tech background knows this. But I've seen a lot of business articles just copying Intel's 'all sides' argument.

      I've never been an Intel fan, and how they handle this consolidates my view of them as a traditional 'evil' corp

      "1. A PoC that demonstrates the basic principles behind variant 1 in userspace on the tested Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, the AMD FX CPU, the AMD PRO CPU and an ARM Cortex A57 [2]. This PoC only tests for the ability to read data inside mis-speculated execution within the same process, without crossing any privilege boundaries.

      2. A PoC for variant 1 that, when running with normal user privileges under a modern Linux kernel with a distro-standard config, can perform arbitrary reads in a 4GiB range [3] in kernel virtual memory on the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU. If the kernel's BPF JIT is enabled (non-default configuration), it also works on the AMD PRO CPU. On the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, kernel virtual memory can be read at a rate of around 2000 bytes per second after around 4 seconds of startup time. [4]"

      "Hardware.We have empirically verified the vulnerability of several Intel processors to Spectre attacks, including Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Skylake based processors. We have also verified the attack’s applicability to AMD Ryzen CPUs. Finally, we have also successfully mounted Spectre attacks on several Samsung and Qualcomm processors (which use an ARM architecture)found in popular mobile phones."

      They even use the word empirical.

      My involuntary thought since I already have PCs I built on AMD is wondering if this vulnerability or the propose software OS update patch will even have any affect on my system. The test AMD CPU used in this PoC is a lot newer than the AMD chips I use on my two desktop systems ie. AMD Opteron 185 and AMD Phenom II.

      My other thought is how would the attacker get administrative permission to even execute code exploit. Don't the current permissions in place still apply to when it comes to defending against any exploit. Don't the ermission to read+execute need to happen first, and this blog post mentions nothing of any sort. Who knows what these control testers were doing to try legitimately hack a PC.

      With that in mind, the urgency for concern of this wans.

      Several AMD FX and at least one APU are affected. And it is very easily exploited remotely. I have no statistics except my machines. Every Intel and AMD processor I have is attacked remotely almost every day. Not sure if I get attacked more than the average person (it seems to me I should be a boring target to either criminal or state attackers) or if there is widespread (psychological) denial. Many people who should be able to see and understand this stuff better than me still speak as if this is overblown.

      It's not. It's real, it's far worse than the most paranoid security scenarios ever imagined, and if you aren't under constant attack then you either don't realize you are being attacked, or your turn hasn't come yet.

      It certainly will; I am nobody and if I'm getting it this bad then I can only imagine that everyone is or will. Perhaps it becomes harder to see with professional level training since professionals "know" even better than anyone that security disaster this bad "can't" happen. But, unfortunately it has happened. Every everything is darn near wide open and remotely exploitable.

      Still waiting for the running, screaming and hair on fire. That is where we should be. Time to disembark from our pleasure cruise on denial.

    From reading GPZ, Spectre, Meltdown and Fogh, it appears that the side-execution attacks are possible on all modern CPUs, but have only been successfully exploited on Intel chips, quite possibly because of the designs they use which make them the most performant. AMD and ARM are harder to exploit because they lack the hardware which in part gives Intel its performance edge.

    Some of the attacks appear exploitable through JavaScript loadable through a webpage in Chrome. It's probably possible through Firefox, Edge, and Safari too. It could read out your passwords. That's pretty devastating.

    Some also allow containerised software access to all the other containers on a physical host, including those on cloud infrastructure. Again, pretty devastating. Google say that have mitigated that threat on their infrastructure (I wonder how?); have others?

    I note that the research exposing these attacks was in large part funded by the EU!

    I think the general claim is that even if AMD is not vulnerable to the specific attacks identified so far, their architecture implements similar features that may well be subject to similar exploits in future. So swapping Intel CPUs for AMD ones \*today\* would indeed reduce your vulnerability, but switching to an AMD processor \*next year\* would not. On the one hand, the Intel-specific attack will have been mitigated in software in the meantime; and on the other, an AMD-specific attack may be discovered later.

    The only reason to switch to AMD in the long term would be if they could demonstrate that their architecture design process is superior, such that exploits like this are significantly less likely. However, given the complexity of modern processors, it would be completely unsurprising if a new family of exploits was discovered that nobody knew to design against.

    It's funny how Project Zero is researching Intel and AMD processors looking for vulnerabilities when this team still hasn't fixed the Android WiFi Direct vulnerability!

    Going on 3 years and still no fix!

    https://threatpost.com/android-wi-fi-direct-vulnerability-details-disclosed/110650/

    Project Zero team, maybe you should work on fixing internal bugs instead of those of other companies!

      Your own source specifies that "Android 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 are not vulnerable, according to the advisory." i.e. all versions of Android still supported by google at the moment (Lollipop except 5.0.x, Marshmallow, Nougat and Oreo) aren't affected by the Wifi Direct vulnerability.

    All these attacks appear to depend on access to the high resolution "timestamp counter" of the CPU. This makes me wonder what would be the negative impact of making the related instructions privileged. Philosophically speaking this sounds as a good idea because it isolates the logical model of computation from access to the real world time.

    Interesting, but not surprised. Since years I routinely deactivate all prefetching systems forcthe CPU in BIOS. At least on VM hosts. I would like to know if such a system is still vulnerable.

    Why I did that? I observed severe performance hits with high virtualizazion ratios. I suspected pipeline trashing and or malallocation of fake HT cores. We had VMS getting scheduled on two fakes (HT cores). They performed bad, but also crippled the VM running on the two real cores.

    Disabling HT resulted in 2x faster response times.

    Disabling PREFETCH (IP and Data) resulted in another 3x faster response.

    JIRA Kanban board (a large one)

    Systems that exhibited performance issues where disk was suspected were recovering and ran smoothly ever after without touching any outside system. (MSExchange)

    HPE has the hints to disable prefetch in their tuning guides for low latency systems.

    I tried replicating something along the lines of PoC 1 (in BASIC of all things), but couldn't get it to read the memory speculatively on an i7-860 from what I could see (it does reliably detect the cache misses when it is in proper code flow). Coming here I see I might need to learn more about branch prediction, I barely know what I'm doing. But after seeing news of this earlier today and reading the papers I thought it sounds worryingly easy, so the fact I got this far starting from scratch in a little over 3 hours (and if it had speculatively executed the read, I would have detected it) is kind of scary.

    Philosophically speaking the root cause for these "bugs" is : program access to fine grained real time information breaks the abstraction of sequential execution. So I wonder whether depriving user space programs of access to such information could solve or at least mitigate the problem. What if e.g. instructions for access to the CPU "timestamp counter" are made privileged and OS - supported timers have sufficiently low resolution?

      Unfortunately it would be a simple matter to repeat each test enough times that a coarse-grained clock would still show the difference, so such a change would only slow an attack down, not stop it.

    I have just received an update of the Windows KB4056892 patch but making a benchmark I noticed that the score is decreased and that is 4691 step in single-core at 4629 instead in multi-core I passed 12588 to 12483 and I have an intel-core i5 of 7th generation with NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030,

    Is there a possibility of getting some dates put on the research articles from Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, et al?

    Seems a little odd that there aren't any dates on those papers other than the reference material. Wouldn't mind knowing when they published those papers.

      Ditto, the year and also where it was published (or technical paper if not in conference proceedings or journal), because even some of the co-authors cite Kocher & al. without any date or venue c.f. reference [19] in https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf

      The problem is that the vulnerability has existed in their CPUs since the 90s. Effectively, every device running an intel cpu is compromised.
      This will probably have a long tail end, as many older machines which will never or cannot be updated will remain exposed for decades.

    Are you sure about the mapping from variant 1/2/3 to Meltdown/Spectre? Looking at the description of Meltdown on the Cyberus blog (http://blog.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2018-01-03-meltdown.html), it seems to correspond to variant 1 (and maybe 2, not sure) as described here (not variant 3).

    This is going to be interesting to see how this plays out in a month. FDIV was bad, I was there but it was self inflicted by how Intel handled it. But this seems like it has way more legal, political and customer relations pathways and the fact that it impacts way more products and it seems like it's not limited to just Intel. As more and more people get their head around this type of attack methodology and apply it to more parts of the CPU and different CPUs, GPUs, etc more products will fall. So right now, batten down the hatches, we are going for a ride...

    What is used for timing? rdtsc with cpuid? (authorize this one as it will notify me of updates).

      Depends. The JavaScript version of the spectre attack uses a separate webworker that increases a value in a tight loop to simulate a good-enough clock. (access to rdtsc is restricted and Chrome already decreases the accuracy of performance.now())

    Passwords, SSNs, credit cards are nothing. Imagine getting the private key from banking institutions, government entities etc. Being able to decrpyt all data to and from these entities would be world changing. HTTPS would become pointless, and everything anyone does with the entity that was compromised would be readable. That is devastating.

    I used rdtscp in my test above. I just tried on a C2D which didn't like that, 'prefixing' rdtsc with cpuid worked. Couldn't confirm speculative accesses on the C2D either (see my post above) but I think I'm just doing it wrong. I had modelled it on my understanding of Meltdown, but my test is more like Spectre because I'm abusing the branch predictor (incompetently).

    Compare that to the statement in the Meltdown paper that they didn't get it working on AMD simply because it didn't - I'm not calling them incompetent but if they don't know why it didn't work and think it might work, then that's the last type of good news wanted by AMD (or ARM).

    It really is a rather simple (and fundamental) issue, there has been a grey cloud hanging over speculative execution since it was conceived (imagine the horrors it could wreak on memory-mapped I/O), but now that engineering curio has become a Problem I can't really see a way out other than locking out all forms of timing from untrusted code, including the ability to run raw code at full speed. That is the inverse of where all these JIT VMs have taken us. It's sort of like the perfect storm. Complexity, speed, determinism.

    There are more ways than this to access kernel space. These cache buffer reads are Tre cool. But what of the sys call kernel internals that link kernel and userland? The kernels memory manager calls on Linux can also be called from userland using similar buffer techniques.

    Out of my curiosity are SPARC CPU, HP PA and IBM POWER architectures are also found vulnerable to this flaw? Because many Legacy Banks and very old organizations still rely on the hardware that runs IBM AIX, HP UNIX, and Oracle {Legacy SUN} Solaris infrastructure. There should always be a patch or method of prevention from the respective vendors.. and this is a never ending learning cycle.

    Well the browser developers begin to turn a little bit @ the timeing functions for js. A little help but this here will get into a full patch and reroll verions roulette.

    If this vulnerabilities are for hardware Intel Chips, for example we have patched the physical Host machine, hosting Virtual machines, is it still necessary to patch the VM's (using virtualized CPU) riding on the physical host that has been patched?

    Hi,
    We are trying to evaluate the possibility of this attack on the below Middleware products:
    1) IBM WebSphere Application Server
    2) IBM WebSphere MQ
    3) IBM Message Broker
    4) Redhat JWS Tomcat
    5) Redhat Directory Server
    6) Oracle Directory Server
    7) CA Siteminder
    8) OpenAM ForgeRock
    9) Oracle WebLogic
    10) Other Oracle Products like ORMB, OID etc.

    Does this vulnerability affects any of these products?

    Control point integrity which moves the code pointers (indirect call pointers and return addresses over stack) to a safe shadow memory having a "RO" permissions should be helpful in combating such attacks. Are any PoC done over Intel's SGX extension.

    Control point integrity which moves the code pointers (indirect call pointers and return addresses over stack) to a safe shadow memory having a "RO" permissions should be helpful in combating such attacks. Are any PoC done over Intel's SGX extension.

    I came up with a solution but it does not involve retpoline, you must think of the problem from a physics point of view, security is binary its either secure or its not, let me give an example of 1 and 0

    The processor is handling 1 to 0 for each bit in question weather it is writing or reading comes after the fact.

    My current solution 7th Jan 18

    T = (phase doubler) divided by 1

    With this equation we can take a step forward in processing logic by adding double phase to the 1 and 0 calculation of a processor

    With phase i have added checkphase similar to checksum on a binary level

    But this can be easily added as kernal to all processors

    This give us a new variable = T

    T equals the phase of the 1 or the 0

    But it does so twice to check and allocate processing by splitting and checking and comparing the digits in a bit twice

    Excellent article, very detailed.

    I've also read an article published on LWN on the same topic but that article caused me some confusion. They provide a similar code sample for demonstrating the boundary check exploit which contained the following lines of code.

     if (offset < array1->length) {
     unsigned char value = array1->data[offset];
     unsigned long index = ((value&1)\*0x100)+0x200;
     if (index < array2->length) // length is < 0x300
     unsigned char value2 = array2->data[index];
     }

    However what I don't understand about this code is, if the LSB of value evaluates to 1 then index is 0x300, but the comment states the length of array2 is < 0x300 which would mean the if statement wouldn't evaluate to true. Now am I correct in assuming that the inner if statement would also trigger speculative execution and the boundary check bypassed again or was this most likely a mistake by the author?

    struct array {
     unsigned long length;
     unsigned char data[];
    };
    struct array \*arr1 = ...;
    unsigned long untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller = ...;

     unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller];
     ...
    }
    However, in the following code sample, there's an issue. If arr1->length, arr2->data[0x200] and arr2->data[0x300] are not cached, but all other accessed data is, and the branch conditions are predicted as true, the processor can do the following speculatively before arr1->length has been loaded and the execution is re-steered:

     load value = arr1->data[untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller]
     start a load from a data-dependent offset in arr2->data, loading the corresponding cache line into the L1 cache

    struct array {
     unsigned long length;
     unsigned char data[];
    };
    struct array \*arr1 = ...; /\* small array \*/
    struct array \*arr2 = ...; /\* array of size 0x400 \*/
    /\* >0x400 (OUT OF BOUNDS!) \*/
    unsigned long untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller = ...;
    if (untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller < arr1->length) {
     unsigned char value = arr1->data[untrusted\_offset\_from\_caller];
     unsigned long index2 = ((value&1)\*0x100)+0x200;
     if (index2 < arr2->length) {
     unsigned char value2 = arr2->data[index2];
     }
    }

    In order to compile the code, is it possible to fill the dots ...? In this way we can verify your discovery.

    It should be clearly mention that an specurative load in user mode does not load the corresponding cache line of kernel data into the L1 cache.

    This results in
    "To be able to actually use this behavior for an attack, an attacker needs to be able to cause the execution of such a vulnerable code pattern in the targeted context with an out-of-bounds index. For this, the vulnerable code pattern must either be present in existing code, or there must be an interpreter or JIT engine that can be used to generate the vulnerable code pattern."
    as described.

    I don't understand why the Variant 1 works on "Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, eBPF JIT is off (default state)", which is the most ("the only" for me) important on this report. It is not proved in this report, if I understand correctly.

    Great article and great job!!!
    However, I do not get how these discovered undocumented features are related to "security vulnerability". There are hundreds or thousands of methods for stealing information from hard-drive, screen, communication channels and memory. But all these security issues have one unambiguous source. The evil program was installed and run on your computer without your permission and authorization. Doesn't matter how it harms your system after that. Destroys your disk, copies your files or have the unauthorized access to other process memory or processor's cache. The security vulnerability is the fact that this program could be started on your computer without your permission. If it happens - there are hundreds of methods to steal your information or harm your computer, and these methods are way more simple and reliable than trying to read other process memory.
    I hope that I miss something and you can help me to figure my mistake out, because 30+ years experience in computer programming and software architecture is challenged by "the storm in the glass of water" caused by the discovery of "security vulnerability" of the chip (???). I wouldn't have any problem if the issue has been classified as "undocumented feature" or bug. It still had to be fixed and you still have done great job and deserves all credits.
    But it is hard for me to accept the discovered issue under the tag of "security". I hope you may help me to fix a gap in my understanding.

      1. It explains how the harmful program can be access on your machine without your permission. Thank you.
      2. However, your example doesn't apply to the majority of personal computers
      3. Suppose VM has read access to hypervisor memory. What "useful" information can it steal from there? How does it finds and extracts sensitive information from the huge amount of data?
      4. It still sounds for me as a problem of OS / software and not hardware.

    1) Are older AMD (pre-2015) APUs vulnerable to all variations of this exploit?
    2) Have there been vulnerability tests released for all tree variants (for consumers to check in with)?
    3) What should I do about my Intel Xeon X5472 workstation?

    AMD claims that Variant Two- Branch Target Injection and Variant Three- Rogue Data Cache Load has a near zero to zero risk on AMD processors. Microsoft also confirmed Xbox One, in which AMD CPU and GPU is used, has no impacted by Meltdown and Spectre

    https://stevivor.com/news/xbox-one-mitigates-recent-chip-related-security-vulnerabilities/

    Here only shows Variant one- bounds check bypass with AMD FX and PRO processor. What about the newer AMD Ryzen and EPYC processor?

    I hope the guys that discovered this will eventually produce some testing applications so that we can test if our systems are really not vulnerable any more after applying all recommended patches. I mean the tests which really try to exploit the vulnerabilities.

    Moreover, as nobody knows if the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild, would it be wise that we change passwords, private keys and other secret parts of our credentials once our systems are patched?

    On x86, it is possible to shutdown speculation following an indirect jump with the UD2 instruction. This is described in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual:

    Assembly/Compiler Coding Rule 14. (M impact, L generality) When indirect branches are present, try to put the most likely target of an indirect branch immediately following the indirect branch. Alternatively, if indirect branches are common but they cannot be predicted by branch prediction hardware, then follow the indirect branch with a UD2 instruction, which will stop the processor from decoding down the fall-through path.

      https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4072698/
      https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/4073119/
      I'd say that all the updates recommended on those pages were issued in January 2018.

      The same applies to Linux distributions listed at the end of https://meltdownattack.com

    Assume you are running a virtual machine on a cloud provider, the cloud provider is also hosting other customers on the same physical hardware.
    Your virtual machine is patched, then another customer decides to run a custom Linux VM with rogue code, hence he can exploit meltdown to read your vm's memory?

    The meltdown fix prevents you from exploiting others, not others from exploiting you, correct?

    I have posted a number of comments that question how this "security breach" can steal the sensitive information. Only the first two comments were published, but the rest just disappeared (or were blocked for some reason).
    I repeat my very simple question - suppose I have read-access to all the memory of all other processes. How can intruder utilize this option in order to discover passwords, usernames etc? Ok, he might be able to find some photos, perhaps. But what about the more sensitive and encrypted information.
    I suggested a very simple test: suppose, I put the attacker program on my computer - is it able to find the entire text message inside another unknown running process, if I provide some key-words? Could it be done, if I encrypt the message?

      Your suggested test is exactly what it can do. Imagine opening up a debugger on the computer capable of reading anything in RAM. Passwords, usernames, what is open, the content of a document being worked on, the data being shuttled back and forth with a client of a server, keys in use, the lot. The bigger the system, the more there is to look through. Photos, ironically probably not (if they are on disk and not in use). Encrypted information no not without a key or password, but usually the point of something being in memory is that it is being worked on, in other words it is decrypted. Not always, but the security model relies on protected memory being unreadable, encryption is usually only used on files on the disk in case they are accidentally disclosed. That's why this "flaw" is so bad - it can read information that is not expected to be encrypted. It's hard to think of a worse-case scenario. Fortunately the patches seem to be practical and the players in the discovery have managed it well and were probably able to prevent mass exploitation at a scale we have never seen before.

      Could you explain, how would you be able to discover sensitive information (passwords, usernames etc) inside the memory dump of tens of gigabytes without knowing the exact layout?
      And what does this memory dump worth when it is created with a speed of 2K byte per second?
      I suggested a very simple test, which is much easier than stealing of sensitive information and I suggested this test because I doubt that it could be done.
      You remind the debugger - that's a very good point. You can write a debugger-like application, which attaches to the process of interest and retrieves the information, if it knows how to do it with this particular process. No need to use "cache-lines" and other tricks. The most computers are vulnerable to this. Isn't it?

      Yuri, the fact that sensitive data is hidden in a lot of noise (tens of GB of data dump) is a classic machine learning problem. If a team is determined to use the flaw, (1) experts in computer security would access/grab the data dump, then (2) experts in data-mining/ machine learning would then separate the data from the "noise".
      The best analogy that comes to mind: suppose we find out that everyone's home has a flaw, where the key to their house is buried somewhere in the garden. Since the flaw affects almost anyone, the probability of any one person getting robbed is extremely low, but if your house is known to contain tons of gold, then it's worth mining your entire garden with metal detectors just to find the key. And entire groups might start deploying an army of miners with metal detectors just to gather as many keys as possible "just in case" (ex: Gov agencies, misc nefarious groups).
      Keep in mind that the data's not encrypted, so it's just a matter of finding recurring patterns. One extremely simplified example: parse the data-dump to get all websites, and look for recurring bank websites, then get the data you input immediately afterwards (yes, I'm over-simplifying a LOT but it's just probabilistic algorithms crunching a lot of data) .... eventually, one'll obtain your online banking password. Same for paypal and what not.
      PS: my field isn't computer security, but rather data mining so to me it's the "easy part" of the problem, though I'd need an accomplice to get the data-dump.

      What you say about the debugger does apply if you're running everything as Administrator or root (or on a C64). But in a secured computer, no ordinary user can attach a debugger to a privileged process, that is locked out and is the whole point of brick-wall like memory protection. It doesn't rely on security through obscurity or hoping things are hard to find, but hardware designed to make it absolutely (completely and utterly) impossible for a normal level user to get past. Computers have had this memory protection hardware for decades.

      I'm not saying extracting the root password would be trivial, but first off in a server with 10s of GB of RAM you can pretty much guarantee it is all being used for something. Reading any of it is almost certain to disclose sensitive data. It might be some random php in a file cache, but it is still data that someone trusts is behind the security wall. The Meltdown dumps were produced at 500KB/s, which is plenty fast enough to find something juicy or dump all RAM in less than a day. I mentioned the debugger because it's interactive - you're sitting there perusing stuff interactively, watching how it changes when you do something, like say attempting to log in over SSH. Even 2KB/s would be enough for that. The mechanics of the attack also means you get a massive hardware assist and can effectively search a lot faster for certain things. If you're logged into some random web host they tell you exactly what kernel is running with what patches, and one of the papers on this attack discusses what structures might be vulnerable even with mitigations like address space randomisation. Without memory protection, there is basically no security at all against locally running code.

    Can someone at Project Zero explain why the FreeBSD Security Team was notified so much later than their counterparts supporting other systems? I am honestly very disappointed in Google's delay in this regard.

    If I use a fingerprint recognition system, can I prevent hacking? Would not it be possible to hack through the program by changing all passwords to fingerprint? Instead, it is based on the assumption that the fingerprint recognition system is based on external USB hardware.

    chrome://extensions Ok, let's try this again. Since I have no idea what the heck you are all talking about; what am I supposed to do now. I mean really-not all of us are computer or MIS geniuses. I went in and deleted the "AdBot" extension. It actually was not marked as enabled, but I dumped it anyway. Then I ran Mbytes & Windows Defender scans. Is there anything else I have to do. Also I did not get any notification from Google about problems!!!!!! This came off a Mbyte post dated 1-7-18.

    When stating that "eBPF's data arrays are less efficient than its function pointer arrays", is this in general, or specific to the pertaining attack vector?

    This is one interesting threat, knowledgeable people may want to review. To my untrained mind this appears to be eerilie similar to what spectre and meltdown contain as a PoC

    Quick question. I've read about Meltdown and Specter. And since they both kind of use cache side effects with access to previlieged memory, would a solution be for the processor to invalidate any cache line of data that was speculatively loaded but ended up not needed?

    Hopefully Intel is working on hardware solution of this flaw. Obvious solution is adding fully isolated device that performs scheduled encryption for all sensitive information, (that does not used for computation anyway), then decryption is done only when request is longer then access time of meltdown.. Such solution will help not only for Meltdown, but also for any attempt to get password without touching keyboard.

      No. "Past" is used here in the sense of "go past", not "in the past".

      The processor can speculatively continue execution beyond (past) a branch.

# Options to address CVE-2017-5753 on XEN platforms

## Environment

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (Xen host and guest)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (Xen guest)

## Issue

* I’m concerned about recent security vulnerabilities incidents, what can be done for my Xen hosted systems?
* Can CVE-2017-5753 be fixed for Xen machines?

## Resolution

Three CVEs were recently made public (CVE-2017-5754 CVE-2017-5753 CVE-2017-5715) that allowed a local attacker to access unauthorized data. CVE-2017-5753 documents the variant of this attack that allows virtualized guests to interact with the host and other guests on the same physical system.

Red Hat’s currently supported virtualization platforms, based on the KVM hypervisor, will have published errata correcting the issue. Red Hat’s older virtualization platform codebase (Xen) has technical limitations that prevent fully addressing these three vulnerabilities, particularly CVE-2017-5715. Some level of risk will exist for hypervisors and guests that use Xen paravirtualization (PV guests).

More recent versions of upstream Xen do allow for a more complete solution, but it is not feasible to apply this solution to the version of Xen shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Cloud providers that use the Xen hypervisor, however, have an option to secure paravirtualized guests running on their servers.

Xen also supports running guests under hardware virtualization (HVM guests). While HVM guests do not have the same limitations as PV guests, and a fix for all three vulnerabilities could be prepared for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, most of our customers running Xen are relying on it due to paravirtualized guest support. Therefore, Red Hat currently is not providing errata to correct the issue for HVM guests either.

Customers are advised to take a Risk-based approach in mitigating this issue. Systems running within XEN that require high-degrees of security and trust should be addressed first, and should be physically isolated from untrusted systems.

| Type of system | Recommended approach |
| --- | --- |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux running as XEN server | XEN PV is not fixable for the above CVEs, and Red Hat currently is not providing errata to correct the issue for HVM either. Red Hat recommends that subscribers migrate to more modern virtualization platforms that can be fixedPlease refer to the [Converting a Xen Linux virtual machine to KVM](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1353783) for migration. |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux running as guest of Cloud Provider | Contact XEN-provider for options available |

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-5754

Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel processors,
enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from
arbitrary addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running
on the system.

This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the Linux
kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set named Kernel Page Table
Isolation, enforcing a near complete separation of the kernel and userspace
address maps and preventing the attack. This solution might have a performance
impact, and can be disabled at boot time by passing `pti=off' to the kernel
command line.

We also identified a regression for ancient userspaces using the vsyscall
interface, for example chroot and containers using (e)glibc 2.13 and older,
including those based on Debian 7 or RHEL/CentOS 6. This regression will be
fixed in a later update.

The other vulnerabilities (named Spectre) published at the same time are not
addressed in this update and will be fixed in a later update.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed in a
separate update.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.9.65-3+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3522-2 fixed a vulnerability in the Linux Hardware Enablement

kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to address Meltdown ([CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754)).

Unfortunately, that update introduced a regression where a few systems

failed to boot successfully. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-109-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)
  -
  [4.4.0-109.132~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial/4.4.0-109.132~14.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-109-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)
  -
  [4.4.0-109.132~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial/4.4.0-109.132~14.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1068032](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1068032) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074562](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074562) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074578](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074578) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1074701](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074701) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075006](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075006) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1075008](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075008) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087939](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087939) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1089055](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1089055) [NEW], [1115045](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1115045) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1136865](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136865) [NEW], [1178658](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178658) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1201877](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1201877) [RESOLVED / WORKSFORME]

controllable speculative execution over code patterns in the Linux
Kernel to leak content from
otherwise not readable memory in the same address space, allowing
retrieval of passwords, cryptographic keys and other secrets.
This problem is mitigated by adding speculative fencing on affected code
paths throughout the Linux kernel.
- CVE-2017-5715 / "SpectreAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring branch prediction could use mispredicted branches to
speculatively execute code patterns that in turn could be made to leak
other non-readable content in the same address space, an attack similar
to CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by disabling predictive branches, depending
on CPU architecture either by firmware updates and/or fixes in the
user-kernel privilege boundaries.
Please also check with your CPU / Hardware vendor for available firmware
or BIOS updates.
As this feature can have a performance impact, it can be disabled using
the "nospec" kernel commandline option.
- CVE-2017-5754 / "MeltdownAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring deep instruction pipelining could use code patterns in
userspace to speculative executive code that would read
otherwise read protected memory.
This problem is mitigated by unmapping the Linux Kernel from the user
address space during user code execution, following a approach called
"KAISER". The terms used here are "KAISER" / "Kernel Address Isolation"
and "PTI" / "Page Table Isolation".
This is only enabled by default on affected architectures.
This feature can be enabled / disabled by the "pti=[on|off|auto]" or
"nopti" commandline options.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-17806: The HMAC implementation (crypto/hmac.c) in the Linux
kernel did not validate that the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm
is unkeyed, allowing a local attacker able to use the AF\_ALG-based hash
interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_HASH) and the SHA-3 hash algorithm
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_SHA3) to cause a kernel stack buffer overflow by
executing a crafted sequence of system calls that encounter a missing
SHA-3 initialization (bnc#1073874).
- CVE-2017-17805: The Salsa20 encryption algorithm in the Linux kernel did
not correctly handle zero-length inputs, allowing a local attacker able
to use the AF\_ALG-based skcipher interface
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_SKCIPHER) to cause a denial of service
(uninitialized-memory free and kernel crash) or have unspecified other
impact by executing a crafted sequence
of system calls that use the blkcipher\_walk API. Both the generic
implementation (crypto/salsa20\_generic.c) and x86 implementation
(arch/x86/crypto/salsa20\_glue.c) of Salsa20 were vulnerable
(bnc#1073792).

Overview
#### Summary

Many modern processors are susceptible to a group of vulnerabilities which are referred to as Meltdown and Spectre. These vulnerabilities allow unprivileged attackers to abuse CPU data cache timing to leak information out of speculated execution, potentially leading to the arbitrary read of virtual memory across local security boundaries via targeted attacks. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows unprivileged attackers to abuse CPU data cache timing to leak information out of speculated execution, potentially leading to the arbitrary read of virtual memory across local security boundaries via targeted attacks. These attacks require the ability to run malicious code directly on the target system.

ONTAP:

Unlike a general-purpose operating system, ONTAP does not provide mechanisms for non-administrative users to run third-party code. Due to this behavior, ONTAP is not affected by either the Spectre or Meltdown attacks. The same is true of all ONTAP variants including both ONTAP running on FAS/AFF hardware as well as virtualized ONTAP products such as ONTAP Select and ONTAP Cloud.

While ONTAP Select and ONTAP Cloud are not directly affected by these attacks, these attacks may be possible against the utilized hypervisor platform. NetApp recommends working with your hypervisor and cloud platform vendors to ensure that your NetApp product is running on a secure and patched platform.

StorageGRID:

StorageGRID and StorageGRID Webscale do not provide mechanisms for running unprivileged third-party code and are not directly affected. For virtualized deployments, NetApp recommends working with your hypervisor and cloud platform vendors to ensure that your NetApp product is running on a secure and patched platform. For Docker-based deployments, NetApp recommends working with your operating system and hardware vendors to ensure that your NetApp product is running on a secure and patched platform.

NetApp HCI Storage Nodes:

Unlike a general-purpose operating system, Element OS is a closed system that does not provide mechanisms for running third-party code. Due to this behavior, Element OS running on SolidFire or NetApp HCI Storage nodes is not affected by either the Spectre or Meltdown attacks as they depend on the ability to run malicious code directly on the target system.

SANtricity:

Unlike a general-purpose operating system, SANtricity does not provide mechanisms for running third-party code. Due to this behavior, SANtricity is not affected by either the Spectre or Meltdown attacks as they depend on the ability to run malicious code directly on the target system.

OnCommand Unified Manager for VMware vSphere:

OnCommand Unified Manager for VMware vSphere packages Unified Manager into a VMware hypervisor environment and does not provide mechanisms for non-administrative users to run third-party code on the hypervisor. Due to this behavior, OnCommand Unified Manager for VMware vSphere is not affected by either the Spectre or Meltdown attacks.

While OnCommand Unified Manager for VMware vSphere is not directly affected by these attacks, these attacks may be possible against the utilized hypervisor platform. NetApp recommends working with your hypervisor and cloud platform vendors to ensure that your NetApp product is running on a secure and patched platform.

Brocade Advisory:

<http://www.brocade.com/content/dam/common/documents/content-types/security-bulletin/brocade-security-advisory-2018-522.htm>

FAS/AFF System Firmware (BIOS):

FAS/AFF BIOS firmware does not provide a mechanism to run arbitrary code and thus is not susceptible to either the Spectre or Meltdown attacks.

NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS):

NetApp HCI Compute Node is tracked as affected with remediation by customer installation of ESXi patches and microcode updates from VMware detailed in [KB 52245](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/52245).

NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node:

The NetApp SolidFire Element OS Management Node provides console access for end users and therefore it is tracked as affected. The underlying hypervisor infrastructure should be patched by customer installation of ESXi patches and microcode updates. Customers running whitebox server should consult the manufacturer for microcode availability.

Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 42.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has 35 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 42.3 kernel was updated to 4.4.104 to receive various
security and bugfixes.
This update adds mitigations for various side channel attacks against
modern CPUs that could disclose content of otherwise unreadable memory
(bnc#1068032).
- CVE-2017-5753 / "SpectreAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring deep instruction pipelining could use attacker
controllable speculative execution over code patterns in the Linux
Kernel to leak content from otherwise not readable memory in the same
address space, allowing retrieval of passwords, cryptographic keys and
other secrets.
This problem is mitigated by adding speculative fencing on affected code
paths throughout the Linux kernel.
- CVE-2017-5715 / "SpectreAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring branch prediction could use mispredicted branches to
speculatively execute code patterns that in turn could be made to leak
other non-readable content in the same address space, an attack similar
to CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by disabling predictive branches, depending
on CPU architecture either by firmware updates and/or fixes in the
user-kernel privilege boundaries.
Please also check with your CPU / Hardware vendor on updated firmware
or BIOS images regarding this issue.
As this feature can have a performance impact, it can be disabled using
the "nospec" kernel commandline option.
- CVE-2017-5754 / "MeltdownAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring deep instruction pipelining could use code patterns in
userspace to speculative executive code that would read
otherwise read protected memory, an attack similar to CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by unmapping the Linux Kernel from the user
address space during user code execution, following a approach called
"KAISER". The terms used here are "KAISER" / "Kernel Address Isolation"
and "PTI" / "Page Table Isolation".
Note that this is only done on affected platforms.
This feature can be enabled / disabled by the "pti=[on|off|auto]" or
"nopti" commandline options.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-17806: The HMAC implementation (crypto/hmac.c) in the Linux
kernel did not validate that the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm
is unkeyed, allowing a local attacker able to use the AF\_ALG-based hash
interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_HASH) and the SHA-3 hash algorithm
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_SHA3) to cause a kernel stack buffer overflow by
executing a crafted sequence of system calls that encounter a missing
SHA-3 initialization (bnc#1073874).
- CVE-2017-17805: The Salsa20 encryption algorithm in the Linux kernel did
not correctly handle zero-length inputs, allowing a local attacker able
to use the AF\_ALG-based skcipher interface
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_SKCIPHER) to cause a denial of service
(uninitialized-memory free and kernel crash) or have unspecified other
impact by executing a crafted sequence of system calls that use the
blkcipher\_walk API. Both the generic implementation
(crypto/salsa20\_generic.c) and x86 implementation
(arch/x86/crypto/salsa20\_glue.c) of Salsa20 were vulnerable
(bnc#1073792).

## Supporting Open Source for an Innovative Ecosystem

As a contributor to the open source software community since 1989, Intel uses industry collaboration, co-engineering, and open source contributions to deliver a steady stream of code and optimizations that work across multiple platforms and use cases.

Our contributions include initiatives with OPEA, PyTorch, and TensorFlow projects. Intel pushes our contributions upstream so developers get the most current and optimized software that works across multiple platforms and maintains security.

As AI grows, Intel believes that an open AI ecosystem is the only way to ensure the responsible use of AI.

# Meltdown and Spectre

Vulnerabilities in modern computers leak passwords and sensitive data.

Meltdown and Spectre exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern processors.
These hardware vulnerabilities allow programs to steal data which is currently processed on the computer.
While programs are typically not permitted to read data from other programs, a malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to get hold of secrets stored in the memory of other running programs.
This might include your passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.

Meltdown and Spectre work on personal computers, mobile devices, and in the cloud.
Depending on the cloud provider's infrastructure, it might be possible to steal data from other customers.

![Meltdown](images/meltdown.min.svg)

#### Meltdown

Meltdown breaks the most fundamental isolation between user applications and the operating system.
This attack allows a program to access the memory, and thus also the secrets, of other programs and the operating system.

If your computer has a vulnerable processor and runs an unpatched operating system, it is not safe to work with sensitive information without the chance of leaking the information. This applies both to personal computers as well as cloud infrastructure. Luckily, there are [software patches against Meltdown](#faq-fix).

 [Meltdown Paper](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
 [Cite](meltdown.bib)

 [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01207)

![Spectre](images/spectre.min.svg)

#### Spectre

Spectre breaks the isolation between different applications.
It allows an attacker to trick error-free programs, which follow best practices, into leaking their secrets.
In fact, the safety checks of said best practices actually increase the attack surface and may make applications more susceptible to Spectre

Spectre is harder to exploit than Meltdown, but it is also harder to mitigate.
[However, it is possible to prevent specific known exploits based on Spectre through software patches.](#faq-fix)

 [Spectre Paper](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)
 [Cite](spectre.bib)

 [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01203)

## Who reported Meltdown?

Meltdown was independently discovered and reported by three teams:

* [Jann
  Horn](https://twitter.com/tehjh) ([Google Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com)),
* Werner Haas, Thomas Prescher ([Cyberus Technology](https://www.cyberus-technology.de)),
* [Daniel Gruss](https://gruss.cc), [Moritz Lipp](https://mlq.me), [Stefan Mangard](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/content/about_iaik/people/mangard_stefan/), [Michael Schwarz](https://misc0110.net/) ([Graz University of Technology](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at))

## Who reported Spectre?

Spectre was independently discovered and reported by two people:

* [Jann
  Horn](https://twitter.com/tehjh) ([Google Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com)) and
* [Paul Kocher](https://paulkocher.com) in collaboration with, in alphabetical order,
  [Daniel Genkin](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danielg3/) ([University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) and [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu)), [Mike Hamburg](https://www.shiftleft.org/) ([Rambus](https://www.rambus.com)), [Moritz Lipp](https://mlq.me) ([Graz University of Technology](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at)), and [Yuval Yarom](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~yval) ([University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) and [Data61](https://www.data61.csiro.au/))

---

## [Questions & Answers](#faq)

#### [Am I affected by the vulnerability?](#faq-affected)

Most certainly, yes.

#### [Can I detect if someone has exploited Meltdown or Spectre against me?](#faq-detect)

Probably not. The exploitation does not leave any traces in traditional log files.

#### [Can my antivirus detect or block this attack?](#faq-antivirus)

While possible in theory, this is unlikely in practice. Unlike usual malware, Meltdown and Spectre are hard to distinguish from regular benign applications. However, your antivirus may detect malware which uses the attacks by comparing binaries after they become known.

#### [What can be leaked?](#faq-leaked)

If your system is affected, our proof-of-concept exploit can read the memory content of your computer. This may include passwords and sensitive data stored on the system.

#### [Has Meltdown or Spectre been abused in the wild?](#faq-wild)

We don't know.

#### [Is there a workaround/fix?](#faq-fix)

There are patches against Meltdown for Linux ( [KPTI (formerly KAISER)](https://lwn.net/Articles/738975/)), Windows,  and OS X.
There is also work to harden software against future exploitation of Spectre, respectively to patch software after exploitation through Spectre ( [LLVM patch](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20180101/513630.html),  [MSVC](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/01/15/spectre-mitigations-in-msvc/),  [ARM speculation barrier header](https://github.com/ARM-software/speculation-barrier)).

#### [Which systems are affected by Meltdown?](#faq-systems-meltdown)

Desktop, Laptop, and Cloud computers may be affected by Meltdown. More technically, every Intel processor which implements out-of-order execution is potentially affected, which is effectively every processor since 1995 (except Intel Itanium and Intel Atom before 2013). We successfully tested Meltdown on Intel processor generations released as early as 2011. Currently, we have only verified Meltdown on Intel processors. At the moment, it is unclear whether AMD processors are also affected by Meltdown.  [According to ARM](https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update), some of their processors are also affected.

#### [Which systems are affected by Spectre?](#faq-systems-spectre)

Almost every system is affected by Spectre: Desktops, Laptops, Cloud Servers, as well as Smartphones. More specifically, all modern processors capable of keeping many instructions in flight are potentially vulnerable. In particular, we have verified Spectre on Intel, AMD, and ARM processors.

#### [Which cloud providers are affected by Meltdown?](#faq-cloud)

Cloud providers which use Intel CPUs and Xen PV as virtualization without having patches applied.
Furthermore, cloud providers without real hardware virtualization, relying on containers that share one kernel, such as Docker, LXC, or OpenVZ are affected.

#### [What is the difference between Meltdown and Spectre?](#faq-meltdown-vs-spectre)

Meltdown breaks the mechanism that keeps applications from accessing arbitrary system memory.
Consequently, applications can access system memory.
Spectre tricks other applications into accessing arbitrary locations in their memory.
Both attacks use side channels to obtain the information from the accessed memory location.
For a more technical discussion we refer to the papers ( [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf) and  [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf))

#### [Why is it called Meltdown?](#faq-why-meltdown)

The vulnerability basically melts security boundaries which are normally enforced by the hardware.

#### [Why is it called Spectre?](#faq-why-spectre)

The name is based on the root cause, speculative execution. As it is not easy to fix, it will haunt us for quite some time.

#### [Is there more technical information about Meltdown and Spectre?](#faq-papers)

Yes, there is an  [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01207) and  [a blog post](http://blog.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2018-01-03-meltdown.html) about Meltdown, and an  [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01203) about Spectre.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3522-3: Linux kernel regression

10 January 2018

USN-3522-1 introduced a regression in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

USN-3522-1 fixed a vulnerability in the Linux kernel to address

Meltdown ([CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754)). Unfortunately, that update introduced

a regression where a few systems failed to boot successfully. This

update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-109-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-109.132](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-109.132)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-109-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.4.0-109.132](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.4.0-109.132)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

An update that solves 17 vulnerabilities and has 13 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP4 kernel was updated to receive various
security and bugfixes.
This update adds mitigations for various side channel attacks against
modern CPUs that could disclose content of otherwise unreadable memory
(bnc#1068032).
- CVE-2017-5753: Local attackers on systems with modern CPUs featuring
deep instruction pipelining could use attacker controllable speculative
execution over code patterns in the Linux Kernel to leak content from
otherwise not readable memory in the same address space, allowing
retrieval of passwords, cryptographic keys and other secrets.
This problem is mitigated by adding speculative fencing on affected code
paths throughout the Linux kernel.
This issue is addressed for the x86\_64, the IBM Power and IBM zSeries
architecture.
- CVE-2017-5715: Local attackers on systems with modern CPUs featuring
branch prediction could use mispredicted branches to speculatively
execute code patterns that in turn could be made to leak other
non-readable content in the same address space, an attack similar to
CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by disabling predictive branches, depending
on CPU architecture either by firmware updates and/or fixes in the
user-kernel privilege boundaries.
This is done with help of Linux Kernel fixes on the Intel/AMD x86\_64 and
IBM zSeries architectures. On x86\_64, this requires also updates of the
CPU microcode packages, delivered in seperate updates.
For IBM Power and zSeries the required firmware updates are supplied
over regular channels by IBM.
As this feature can have a performance impact, it can be disabled using
the "nospec" kernel commandline option.
- CVE-2017-5754: Local attackers on systems with modern CPUs featuring
deep instruction pipelining could use code patterns in userspace to
speculative executive code that would read otherwise read protected
memory, an attack similar to CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by unmapping the Linux Kernel from the user
address space during user code execution, following a approach called
"KAISER". The terms used here are "KAISER" / "Kernel Address Isolation"
and "PTI" / "Page Table Isolation".
This update does this on the Intel x86\_64 and IBM Power architecture.
Updates are also necessary for the ARM architecture, but will be delivered
in the next round of updates.
This feature can be enabled / disabled by the "pti=[on|off|auto]" or
"nopti" commandline options.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-17806: The HMAC implementation (crypto/hmac.c) in the Linux
kernel did not validate that the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm
is unkeyed, allowing a local attacker able to use the AF\_ALG-based hash
interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_HASH) and the SHA-3 hash algorithm
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_SHA3) to cause a kernel stack buffer overflow by
executing a crafted sequence of system calls that encounter a missing
SHA-3 initialization (bnc#1073874).
- CVE-2017-17805: The Salsa20 encryption algorithm in the Linux kernel did
not correctly handle zero-length inputs, allowing a local attacker able
to use the AF\_ALG-based skcipher interface
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_SKCIPHER) to cause a denial of service
(uninitialized-memory free and kernel crash) or have unspecified other
impact by executing a crafted sequence of system calls that use the
blkcipher\_walk API. Both the generic implementation
(crypto/salsa20\_generic.c) and x86 implementation
(arch/x86/crypto/salsa20\_glue.c) of Salsa20 were vulnerable
(bnc#1073792).
- CVE-2017-15868: The bnep\_add\_connection function in
net/bluetooth/bnep/core.c in the Linux kernel did not ensure that an
l2cap socket is available, which allowed local users to gain privileges
via a crafted application (bnc#1071470).
- CVE-2017-13167: An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the kernel
sound timer. (bnc#1072876).
- CVE-2017-16538: drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/lmedm04.c in the Linux
kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (general
protection fault and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via a crafted USB device, related to a missing warm-start check
and incorrect attach timing (dm04\_lme2510\_frontend\_attach versus
dm04\_lme2510\_tuner) (bnc#1066569).
- CVE-2017-17558: The usb\_destroy\_configuration function in
drivers/usb/core/config.c in the USB core subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not consider the maximum number of configurations and interfaces
before attempting to release resources, which allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write access) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device (bnc#1072561).
- CVE-2017-17450: net/netfilter/xt\_osf.c in the Linux kernel did not
require the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability for add\_callback and
remove\_callback operations, which allowed local users to bypass intended
access restrictions because the xt\_osf\_fingers data structure is shared
across all net namespaces (bnc#1071695).
- CVE-2017-8824: The dccp\_disconnect function in net/dccp/proto.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of
service (use-after-free) via an AF\_UNSPEC connect system call during the
DCCP\_LISTEN state (bnc#1070771).
- CVE-2017-16939: The XFRM dump policy implementation in
net/xfrm/xfrm\_user.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain
privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a crafted
SO\_RCVBUF setsockopt system call in conjunction with XFRM\_MSG\_GETPOLICY
Netlink messages (bnc#1069702).
- CVE-2017-15115: The sctp\_do\_peeloff function in net/sctp/socket.c in the
Linux kernel did not check whether the intended netns is used in a
peel-off action, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other
impact via crafted system calls (bnc#1068671).
- CVE-2017-14106: The tcp\_disconnect function in net/ipv4/tcp.c in the

# USN-3524-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerability

10 January 2018

The system could be made to expose sensitive information.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3524-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-139-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-139.188~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-139.188~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.139.129](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-139.188~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-139-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-139.188~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-139.188~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.139.129](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-139.188~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3522-2: Linux (Xenial HWE) vulnerability

9 January 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3522-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

([CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1009-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.4.0-1009.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.4.0-1009.9)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-108-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)
  -
  [4.4.0-108.131~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial/4.4.0-108.131~14.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-108-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)
  -
  [4.4.0-108.131~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial/4.4.0-108.131~14.04.1)

"category": "summary",
"title": "Summary",
"text": "On January 3, 2018, researchers disclosed three vulnerabilities that take advantage of the implementation of speculative execution of instructions on many modern microprocessor architectures to perform side-channel information disclosure attacks. These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes or memory allocated to the operating system kernel.\r\n\r\nThe first two vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715, are collectively known as Spectre. The third vulnerability, CVE-2017-5754, is known as Meltdown. The vulnerabilities are all variants of the same attack and differ in the way that speculative execution is exploited.\r\n\r\nTo exploit any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.\r\n\r\nA Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying hardware, as well as operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cisco cloud services are not directly affected by these vulnerabilities, the infrastructure on which they run may be impacted. Refer to the ���Affected Products��� section of this advisory for information about the impact of these vulnerabilities on Cisco cloud services.\r\n\r\nCisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180104-cpusidechannel [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180104-cpusidechannel\"]"

"text": "Cisco is investigating its product line to determine which products and cloud services may be affected by these vulnerabilities. As the investigation progresses, Cisco will update this advisory with information about affected products and services, including the Cisco bug ID for each affected product or service.\r\n\r\nAny product or service not listed in the ���Products Under Investigation��� or ���Vulnerable Products��� section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable. The criteria for considering whether a product is vulnerable is explained in the ���Summary��� section of this advisory. Because this is an ongoing investigation, please be aware that products and services currently considered not vulnerable may subsequently be considered vulnerable as additional information becomes available.\r\n\r\nProducts Under Investigation\r\nNo products are currently under active investigation to determine whether they are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory."

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## CPU hardware utilizing speculative execution may be vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#180049

Original Release Date: 2018-05-21 | Last Revised: 2018-06-19

---

### Overview

CPU hardware utilizing speculative execution may be vulnerable to cache timing side-channel analysis. Two vulnerabilities are identified, known as "Variant 3a" and "Variant 4".

### Description

| Speculative execution is a technique used by many modern processors to improve performance by predicting which instructions may be executed based on past execution history. An attacker with local user access may be able to utilize sequences of speculative execution to perform a cache timing side-channel analysis.  [**CWE-208**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html)**: Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy**CVE-2018-3639 – Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) – also known as "Variant 4"Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and speculative execution of memory reads before the addresses of all prior memory writes are known may read an earlier value of the data. Subsequent speculative memory accesses cause allocations into the cache, which may allow a sequence of speculative loads to be used to perform timing side-channel attacks. In particular, if an attacker has control of a previously cached value, or the first store and load instructions are accesses onto the stack, an attacker may be able to control future speculative execution and access arbitrary privileged data by using less privileged code with timing side-channel analysis.CVE-2018-3640 – Rogue System Register Read (RSRE) – also known as "Variant 3a"Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and that perform speculative reads of system registers may return a speculative register value that is then used in subsequent speculative load instructions. These subsequence speculative loads cause allocations into the cache that may allow a sequence of speculative loads to be used to perform timing side-channel attacks. An attacker with local user access may be able to use timing side-channel analysis to determine the values stored in system registers.For more information and technical details, please see the original Project Zero [bug report](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1528), Intel's security advisory [INTEL-SA-00115](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00115.html), AMD's [whitepaper](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/124441_AMD64_SpeculativeStoreBypassDisable_Whitepaper_final.pdf), and ARM's [whitepaper](https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability).These vulnerabilities have been noted in the media for their similarity to previously-disclosed vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-5753 (Variant 1, "Spectre"), CVE-2017-5715 (Variant 2, "Spectre"), CVE-2017-5754 (Variant 3, "Meltdown"). See [VU#584653](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/584653) for further information. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with local user access may be able to read arbitrary privileged data or system register values by utilizing cache timing side-channel analysis. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update system software**Affected users should check with OEM and system software vendors and apply any available updates as soon as possible. Microcode updates and other system updates are expected to be available within the coming weeks. The Vendor Status links below provide further information.**Update your browser**Affected users should update to the latest version of any web browser in use. Most leading browser providers have recently deployed mitigations in their Managed Runtimes – mitigations that substantially increase the difficulty of exploiting side channels in a modern web browser. These techniques would likewise increase the difficulty of exploiting a side channel in a browser based on SSB. |

## CPU hardware vulnerable to side-channel attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#584653

Original Release Date: 2018-01-04 | Last Revised: 2022-01-07

---

### Overview

CPU hardware implementations are vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks. These vulnerabilities are referred to as [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) and [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/).

### Description

CPU hardware implementations are vulnerable to side-channel attacks referred to as [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) and [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/). Both Spectre and Meltdown take advantage of the ability to extract information from instructions that have executed on a CPU using the CPU cache as a side-channel. These attacks are described in detail by [Google Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html), the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK) at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) and Anders Fogh. The issues are organized into three variants:

+ Variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753, [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)): Bounds check bypass

+ Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715, also [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)): Branch target injection

+ Variant 3 (CVE-2017-5754, [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)): Rogue data cache load, memory access permission check performed after kernel memory read

**Spectre**

Spectre attacks take advantage of a CPU's branch prediction capabilities. Modern CPUs include a feature called branch prediction, which speculatively executes instructions at a location that the CPU believes it will branch to. Such speculative execution helps to more fully utilize the parts of the CPU, minimizing the time waiting, and therefore improving performance. When a branch is successfully predicted, instructions will retire, which means the outcomes of the instructions such as register and memory writes will be committed. If a branch is mispredicted, the speculatively-executed instructions will be discarded, and the direct side-effects of the instructions are undone. What is not undone are the indirect side-effects, such as CPU cache changes. By measuring latency of memory access operations, the cache can be used to extract values from speculatively-executed instructions.

With Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753), the instructions after a conditional branch are speculatively executed as the result of a misprediction. With Spectre variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715), the CPU executes instructions at a location determined by a mispredicted branch target.

With both variants of the Spectre attack, the impact is that a process may leak sensitive data to other processes on a system. Spectre may also allow one part of an application to access other parts of the same process memory space that would otherwise not be permitted.

While the Spectre attack itself does not cross a user/kernel memory privilege boundary, depending on the configuration of the target platform, the Spectre attack may indirectly allow a user-space application to access kernel memory. For example, the [Project Zero blog post](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html) describes a scenario that uses eBPF to exfiltrate kernel memory contents into user-space code. This is made possible because eBPF JIT allows for userspace applications to inject code that is executed in kernel space. While this code is verified by the kernel, eBPF-compliant code will be allowed to execute with kernel permissions. The exploit described by Project Zero leverages eBPF to execute the Spectre attack in kernel space, while exfiltrating the data to user space. It is possible that other technologies that allow in-kernel code execution may also possibly be leveraged to leak kernel memory using Spectre.

**Meltdown**

Meltdown is related to the Spectre attack in that it also uses a cache side channel to access data that otherwise wouldn't be available. The main difference is that it leverages out-of-order execution capabilities in modern CPUs. Like speculative execution due to branch prediction, as used by Spectre, out-of-order execution on a CPU is a technique for ensuring fullest utilization of the CPU's parts. Although instructions may appear sequentially in the machine language, a CPU that supports out-of-order execution may execute instructions in a non-sequential manner, which can minimize the time that a CPU spends idle.

Meltdown leverages insecure behavior that has been demonstrated in Intel CPUs and may affect CPUs from other vendors. Vulnerable CPUs allow memory reads in out-of-order instruction execution, and also contain a race condition between the raising of exceptions and the out-of-order instruction execution. The Meltdown attack reads a kernel memory value, which raises an exception because code running with user-space privileges are not permitted to directly read kernel memory. However, due to the race condition, out-of-order instructions following the faulting instruction may also execute. Even though instructions appear after the faulting instruction, out-of-order execution allows them to execute, using data retrieved from the instruction that raises the exception. By the time the exception is raised, some number of out-of-order instructions have executed. Although the raised exception causes the CPU to roll back the out-of-order instructions, the cache state is not reverted. This allows data from out-of-order instructions to persist beyond the point when the exception has been raised.

The impact of Meltdown is that a process running in user space is able to view the contents of kernel memory. Meltdown may also allow Spectre-like memory content leaking that does not cross the user/kernel privilege boundary.

The Linux kernel mitigations for Meltdown are referred to as KAISER, and subsequently KPTI, which aim to improve separation of kernel and user memory pages. Because the Spectre attacks do not cross user/kernel boundaries, the protections introduced with KAISER/KPTI do not add any protection against them.

The following table compares Spectre and Meltdown.

|  | **Spectre** | **Meltdown** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CPU mechanism for triggering** | Speculative execution from branch prediction | Out-of-order execution |
| **Affected platforms** | CPUs that perform speculative execution from branch prediction | CPUs that allow memory reads in out-of-order instructions |
| **Difficulty of successful attack** | High - Requires tailoring to the software environment of the victim process | Low - Kernel memory access exploit code is mostly universal |
| **Impact** | Cross- and intra-process (including kernel) memory disclosure | Kernel memory disclosure to userspace |
| **Software mitigations** | Variant 1: Compiler changes. Web browser updates to help prevent exploitation from JavaScriptVariant 2: Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation ([IBRS](https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/1/4/615)). **Note:** The software mitigation for Spectre variant 2 requires CPU microcode updates | Kernel page-table isolation ([KPTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation)) |

### Impact

An attacker able to execute code with user privileges can achieve various impacts. The Meltdown attack allows reading of kernel memory from userspace. This can result in privilege escalation, disclosure of sensitive information, or it can weaken kernel-level protections, such as KASLR. The Spectre attack can allow inter-process or intra-process data leaks.

To execute code locally, an attacker would require a valid account or independent compromise of the target. Attacks using JavaScript in web browsers are possible. Multi-user and multi-tenant systems (including virtualized and cloud environments) likely face the greatest risk. Systems used to browse arbitrary web sites are also at risk. Single-user systems that do not readily provide a way for attackers to execute code locally face significantly lower risk.

### Solution

**Apply updates**

Operating system, CPU microcode updates, and some application updates mitigate these attacks. Note that in many cases, the software fixes for these vulnerabilities will have a negative affect on system performance. Also note that Microsoft Windows systems [will no longer receive security updates](https://doublepulsar.com/important-information-about-microsoft-meltdown-cpu-security-fixes-antivirus-vendors-and-you-a852ba0292ec) via Windows Update if they are not running compliant anti-virus software. As with deploying any software updates, be sure to prioritize and test updates as necessary.

**Consider CPU Options**

Initial reports from the field indicate that overall system performance is impacted by many of the available patches for these vulnerabilities. Depending on the software workflow and the CPU capabilities present, the performance impact of software mitigations may be non-trivial and therefore may become an ongoing operational concern for some organizations. While we recognize that replacing existing CPUs in already deployed systems is not practical, organizations acquiring new systems should evaluate their CPU selection in light of the expected longevity of this vulnerability in available hardware as well as the performance impacts resulting from the various platform-specific software patches. Deployment contexts and performance requirements vary widely, and must be balanced by informed evaluation of the associated security risks. Contact your system vendor to determine if the CPU and operating system combination will experience a performance penalty due to software mitigations for these vulnerabilities.

                                 version 12

        Information leak via side effects of speculative execution

UPDATES IN VERSION 12
=====================

Corrections to ARM SP2 information:

* ARM 32-bit requires new firmware on some CPUs.
* Provide link to the ARM firmware page, accordingly.
* ARM 32-bit mitigations are complete for Cortex-A CPUs.
  We do not have information for other ARM CPUs at this time.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Processors give the illusion of a sequence of instructions executed
one-by-one.  However, in order to most efficiently use cpu resources,
modern superscalar processors actually begin executing many
instructions in parallel.  In cases where instructions depend on the
result of previous instructions or checks which have not yet
completed, execution happens based on guesses about what the outcome
will be.  If the guess is correct, execution has been sped up.  If the
guess is incorrect, partially-executed instructions are cancelled and
architectural state changes (to registers, memory, and so on)
reverted; but the whole process is no slower than if no guess had been
made at all.  This is sometimes called "speculative execution".

Unfortunately, although architectural state is rolled back, there are
other side effects, such as changes to TLB or cache state, which are
not rolled back.  These side effects can subsequently be detected by
an attacker to determine information about what happened during the
speculative execution phase.  If an attacker can cause speculative
execution to access sensitive memory areas, they may be able to infer
what that sensitive memory contained.

Furthermore, these guesses can often be 'poisoned', such that attacker
can cause logic to reliably 'guess' the way the attacker chooses.
This advisory discusses three ways to cause speculative execution to
access sensitive memory areas (named here according to the
discoverer's naming scheme):

"Bounds-check bypass" (aka SP1, "Variant 1", Spectre CVE-2017-5753):
Poison the branch predictor, such that victim code is speculatively
executed past boundary and security checks.  This would allow an
attacker to, for instance, cause speculative code in the normal
hypercall / emulation path to execute with wild array indexes.

"Branch Target Injection" (aka SP2, "Variant 2", Spectre CVE-2017-5715):
Poison the branch predictor.  Well-abstracted code often involves
calling function pointers via indirect branches; reading these
function pointers may involve a (slow) memory access, so the CPU
attempts to guess where indirect branches will lead.  Poisoning this
enables an attacker to speculatively branch to any code that is
executable by the victim (eg, anywhere in the hypervisor).

"Rogue Data Load" (aka SP3, "Variant 3", Meltdown, CVE-2017-5754):
On some processors, certain pagetable permission checks only happen
when the instruction is retired; effectively meaning that speculative
execution is not subject to pagetable permission checks.  On such
processors, an attacker can speculatively execute arbitrary code in
userspace with, effectively, the highest privilege level.

More information is available here:
  <https://meltdownattack.com>/
  <https://spectreattack.com>/
  <https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.co.uk/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html>

Additional Xen-specific background:

Xen hypervisors on most systems map all of physical RAM, so code
speculatively executed in a hypervisor context can read all of system
RAM.

When running PV guests, the guest and the hypervisor share the address
space; guest kernels run in a lower privilege level, and Xen runs in
the highest privilege level.  (x86 HVM and PVH guests, and ARM guests,
run in a separate address space to the hypervisor.)  However, only
64-bit PV guests can generate addresses large enough to point to
hypervisor memory.

IMPACT
======

Xen guests may be able to infer the contents of arbitrary host memory,
including memory assigned to other guests.

An attacker's choice of code to speculatively execute (and thus the
ease of extracting useful information) goes up with the numbers.  For
SP1, an attacker is limited to windows of code after bound checks of
user-supplied indexes.  For SP2, the attacker will in many cases will
be limited to executing arbitrary pre-existing code inside of Xen.
For SP3 (and other cases for SP2), an attacker can write arbitrary
code to speculatively execute.

Additionally, in general, attacks within a guest (from guest user to
guest kernel) will be the same as on real hardware.  Consult your
operating system provider for more information.

NOTE ON TIMING
==============

This vulnerability was originally scheduled to be made public on 9
January.  It was accelerated at the request of the discloser due to
one of the issues being made public.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

For SP1 and SP2, both Intel and AMD are vulnerable.  Vulnerability of
ARM processors to SP1 and SP2 varies by model and manufacturer.  ARM
has information on affected models on the following website:
   <https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update>

For SP3, only Intel processors are vulnerable.  (The hypervisor cannot
be attacked using SP3 on any ARM processors, even those that are
listed as affected by SP3.)

Furthermore, only 64-bit PV guests can exploit SP3 against Xen.  PVH,
HVM, and 32-bit PV guests cannot exploit SP3.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation for SP1.

SP2 can be mitigated by a combination of new microcode and compiler
and hypervisor changes.  See Resolution below.

SP3 can be mitigated by page-table isolation ("PTI").
See Resolution below.

SP3 can, alternatively, be mitigated by running guests in HVM or PVH
mode.  (Within-guest attacks are still possible unless the guest OS
has also been updated with an SP3 mitigation series such as
KPTI/Kaiser.)

For guests with legacy PV kernels which cannot be run in HVM or PVH
mode directly, we have developed two "shim" hypervisors that allow PV
guests to run in HVM mode or PVH mode.  This prevents attacks on the
host, but it leaves the guest vulnerable to Meltdown attacks by its
own unprivileged processes, even if the guest OS has KPTI or similar
Meltdown mitigation.

The HVM shim (codenamed "Vixen") is available now, as is the PVH shim
(codenamed "Comet") for Xen 4.10 and Xen 4.8.   Please read
README.which-shim to determine which shim is suitable for you.

RESOLUTION
==========

These are hardware bugs, so technically speaking they cannot be
properly fixed in software.  However, it is possible in many cases to
provide patches to software to work around the problems.

There is no available resolution for SP1.  A solution may be available
in the future.

SP2 can be mitigated on x86 by combinations of new CPU microcode and
new hypervisor code.  The required hypervisor changes for Xen 4.6,
4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10 are detailed in the attached README.bti.

For AMD hardware, and for Intel hardware pre-dating the Skylake
microarchitecture, the hypervisor changes alone are sufficient to
mitigate the issue for Xen itself.  No microcode updates are required.
For the Intel Skylake microarchitecture the hypervisor changes are
insufficient to protect Xen without appropriate new microcode.
Microcode updates are required in any event to guard against one guest
attacking another.

Consult Intel, your hardware vendor, or your dom0 OS distributor for the
microcode updates.

Additionally, compiler support for `indirect thunk' is required.
Again, without appropriate compiler support, the hypervisor patches
are insufficient.  Consult your compiler distributor.

SP2 is mitigated on ARM 32-bit by a set of changes to the hypervisor;
on some processors, in combination with new firmware.  SP2 can be
mitigated on ARM 64-bit (aarch64) by a combination of new PSCI
firmware and new hypervisor code.  The required hypervisor changes for
Xen 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10 are detailed in the attached
README.bti.

For ARM 32-bit these changes are complete for Cortex-A processors.
For other processors, please contact the vendor for information.

For ARM 64-bit the hypervisor changes are still in development and are
expected to be available soon.

SP3 can be mitigated by page-table isolation ("PTI").

We have a "stage 1" implementation.  It allows 64-bit PV guests to be
run natively while restricting what can be accessed via SP3 to the Xen
stack of the current pcpu (which may contain remnants of information
from other guests, but should be much more difficult to attack
reliably).

Unfortunately these "stage 1" patches incur a non-negligible
performance overhead; about equivalent to the "PV shim" approaches
above.  Moving to plain HVM or PVH guests is recommended where
possible.  For more information on that, see below.

Patches for the "stage-1" PTI implementation are available in the Xen
staging-NN branches for each Xen revision.  See README.pti for
specific revisons.

[1] PVH is supported in Xen 4.8 only with the 4.8 "Comet" security
release branch.

[2] Some features in PVH/HVM shim guests are not inherently broken,
but buggy in the currently available versions.  These may be fixed in
future proper releases of the same feature.

[3] Most unikernels have Xen support based on a version of mini-os.
mini-os master can boot PVH.  But this is very recent.

[4] Some guests which have support for Xen PV fail to boot properly in
Xen HVM.  Some such guests can made to boot HVM by disabling the
PV-on-HVM support entirely in the guest or in Xen; in that case the
guest may work but IO performance will be poor.  Some PV-supporting
guests can boot as HVM, with PV drivers, but fail when migrated.

[5] The Comet and Vixen shim hypervisors direct-map all of their
"physical" memory, and that direct-map can be accessed using Meltdown
by unprivileged processes in the guest.  So the guest is vulnerable to
within-guest Meltdown attacks and the guest operating system cannot
protect itself.

[6] "Vixen" HVM shim is not expected to be incorporated in future Xen
stable releases.  At some point, support for it will be withdrawn.
However, HVM shim functionality may be available in a future Xen 4.10
stable point release and would then probably be useable with the
existing conversion script provided in this advisory.

[7] The lifetime of the special Comet branches is limited, but we will
not desupport them until some time after the same functionality is in
appropriate Xen stable point releases.

[8] The 64-bit x86 PV guest ABI precludes a guest from mapping its
kernel and userspace in the same address space.  So these guests are
inherently immune to within-guest Meltdown attacks, without
within-guest patching.  (This applies to 64-bit x86 PV guests only.)

[9] It is not possible to run dom0 as HVM.  dom0 PVH is a planned
enhancement which is not yet available even in preview form.

---

### Bulletin Summary

NVIDIA is providing an initial security update to mitigate aspects of Google Project Zero's January 3, 2018, publication of novel information disclosure attacks that combine CPU speculative execution with known side channels.

NVIDIA believes SHIELD TV GPU hardware is immune to the reported security issue. SHIELD TV integrates an Arm (CPU) processor that may, in certain circumstances, benefit from software mitigations to reduce the risk of the exploits identified in the Google Project Zero disclosure. For more information, refer to the [Arm Security Update](https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update).

This bulletin addresses NVIDIA software updates for SHIELD TV to mitigate aspects of the potential Arm CPU vulnerabilities.

These potential vulnerabilities have three known variants:

* **Variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753)**: Software mitigations for the Arm CPU issue are provided with the security update included in this bulletin. NVIDIA expects to work together with its ecosystem partners as future updates are released to further strengthen mitigations for the potentially affected CPU.
* **Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715)**: Software mitigations for the Arm CPU issue are provided with the security update included in this bulletin. NVIDIA expects to work together with its ecosystem partners as future updates are released to further strengthen mitigations for the potentially affected CPU.
* **Variant 3 (CVE-2017-5754)**: NVIDIA believes that SHIELD TV is not vulnerable to this variant.
* **Variant 3a (CVE-2017-5754)**: Based on [Arm's Security Update](https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update), NVIDIA believes that SHIELD TV does not need software mitigations for this variant.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

([CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly check the relationship between pointer

values and the BPF stack. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17863](/security/CVE-2017-17863))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16995](/security/CVE-2017-16995))

Alexei Starovoitov discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)

implementation in the Linux kernel contained a branch-pruning logic issue

around unreachable code. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service. ([CVE-2017-17862](/security/CVE-2017-17862))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel mishandled pointer data values in some situations. A

local attacker could use this to to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2017-17864](/security/CVE-2017-17864))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-25-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-25.29](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-25.29)
* [linux-image-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.25.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-25.29)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-25-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-25.29](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-25.29)
* [linux-image-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.25.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-25.29)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 297 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2494878.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://www.java.com/en/](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 35 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  33 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2019), [My Oracle Support Note 2514102.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2514102.1).

### Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 11 new security fixes for the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite.  7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2019 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2498664.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2498664.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 5 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1068032](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1068032) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074562](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074562) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074578](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074578) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1074701](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074701) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075006](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075006) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1075008](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075008) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087939](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087939) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1089055](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1089055) [NEW], [1115045](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1115045) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1136865](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136865) [NEW], [1178658](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178658) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1201877](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1201877) [RESOLVED / WORKSFORME]

## CPU hardware vulnerable to side-channel attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#584653

Original Release Date: 2018-01-04 | Last Revised: 2022-01-07

---

### Overview

CPU hardware implementations are vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks. These vulnerabilities are referred to as [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) and [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/).

### Description

CPU hardware implementations are vulnerable to side-channel attacks referred to as [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) and [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/). Both Spectre and Meltdown take advantage of the ability to extract information from instructions that have executed on a CPU using the CPU cache as a side-channel. These attacks are described in detail by [Google Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html), the Institute of Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK) at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) and Anders Fogh. The issues are organized into three variants:

+ Variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753, [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)): Bounds check bypass

+ Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715, also [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf)): Branch target injection

+ Variant 3 (CVE-2017-5754, [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)): Rogue data cache load, memory access permission check performed after kernel memory read

**Spectre**

Spectre attacks take advantage of a CPU's branch prediction capabilities. Modern CPUs include a feature called branch prediction, which speculatively executes instructions at a location that the CPU believes it will branch to. Such speculative execution helps to more fully utilize the parts of the CPU, minimizing the time waiting, and therefore improving performance. When a branch is successfully predicted, instructions will retire, which means the outcomes of the instructions such as register and memory writes will be committed. If a branch is mispredicted, the speculatively-executed instructions will be discarded, and the direct side-effects of the instructions are undone. What is not undone are the indirect side-effects, such as CPU cache changes. By measuring latency of memory access operations, the cache can be used to extract values from speculatively-executed instructions.

With Spectre variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753), the instructions after a conditional branch are speculatively executed as the result of a misprediction. With Spectre variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715), the CPU executes instructions at a location determined by a mispredicted branch target.

With both variants of the Spectre attack, the impact is that a process may leak sensitive data to other processes on a system. Spectre may also allow one part of an application to access other parts of the same process memory space that would otherwise not be permitted.

While the Spectre attack itself does not cross a user/kernel memory privilege boundary, depending on the configuration of the target platform, the Spectre attack may indirectly allow a user-space application to access kernel memory. For example, the [Project Zero blog post](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html) describes a scenario that uses eBPF to exfiltrate kernel memory contents into user-space code. This is made possible because eBPF JIT allows for userspace applications to inject code that is executed in kernel space. While this code is verified by the kernel, eBPF-compliant code will be allowed to execute with kernel permissions. The exploit described by Project Zero leverages eBPF to execute the Spectre attack in kernel space, while exfiltrating the data to user space. It is possible that other technologies that allow in-kernel code execution may also possibly be leveraged to leak kernel memory using Spectre.

**Meltdown**

Meltdown is related to the Spectre attack in that it also uses a cache side channel to access data that otherwise wouldn't be available. The main difference is that it leverages out-of-order execution capabilities in modern CPUs. Like speculative execution due to branch prediction, as used by Spectre, out-of-order execution on a CPU is a technique for ensuring fullest utilization of the CPU's parts. Although instructions may appear sequentially in the machine language, a CPU that supports out-of-order execution may execute instructions in a non-sequential manner, which can minimize the time that a CPU spends idle.

Meltdown leverages insecure behavior that has been demonstrated in Intel CPUs and may affect CPUs from other vendors. Vulnerable CPUs allow memory reads in out-of-order instruction execution, and also contain a race condition between the raising of exceptions and the out-of-order instruction execution. The Meltdown attack reads a kernel memory value, which raises an exception because code running with user-space privileges are not permitted to directly read kernel memory. However, due to the race condition, out-of-order instructions following the faulting instruction may also execute. Even though instructions appear after the faulting instruction, out-of-order execution allows them to execute, using data retrieved from the instruction that raises the exception. By the time the exception is raised, some number of out-of-order instructions have executed. Although the raised exception causes the CPU to roll back the out-of-order instructions, the cache state is not reverted. This allows data from out-of-order instructions to persist beyond the point when the exception has been raised.

The impact of Meltdown is that a process running in user space is able to view the contents of kernel memory. Meltdown may also allow Spectre-like memory content leaking that does not cross the user/kernel privilege boundary.

The Linux kernel mitigations for Meltdown are referred to as KAISER, and subsequently KPTI, which aim to improve separation of kernel and user memory pages. Because the Spectre attacks do not cross user/kernel boundaries, the protections introduced with KAISER/KPTI do not add any protection against them.

The following table compares Spectre and Meltdown.

|  | **Spectre** | **Meltdown** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CPU mechanism for triggering** | Speculative execution from branch prediction | Out-of-order execution |
| **Affected platforms** | CPUs that perform speculative execution from branch prediction | CPUs that allow memory reads in out-of-order instructions |
| **Difficulty of successful attack** | High - Requires tailoring to the software environment of the victim process | Low - Kernel memory access exploit code is mostly universal |
| **Impact** | Cross- and intra-process (including kernel) memory disclosure | Kernel memory disclosure to userspace |
| **Software mitigations** | Variant 1: Compiler changes. Web browser updates to help prevent exploitation from JavaScriptVariant 2: Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation ([IBRS](https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/1/4/615)). **Note:** The software mitigation for Spectre variant 2 requires CPU microcode updates | Kernel page-table isolation ([KPTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation)) |

### Impact

An attacker able to execute code with user privileges can achieve various impacts. The Meltdown attack allows reading of kernel memory from userspace. This can result in privilege escalation, disclosure of sensitive information, or it can weaken kernel-level protections, such as KASLR. The Spectre attack can allow inter-process or intra-process data leaks.

To execute code locally, an attacker would require a valid account or independent compromise of the target. Attacks using JavaScript in web browsers are possible. Multi-user and multi-tenant systems (including virtualized and cloud environments) likely face the greatest risk. Systems used to browse arbitrary web sites are also at risk. Single-user systems that do not readily provide a way for attackers to execute code locally face significantly lower risk.

### Solution

**Apply updates**

Operating system, CPU microcode updates, and some application updates mitigate these attacks. Note that in many cases, the software fixes for these vulnerabilities will have a negative affect on system performance. Also note that Microsoft Windows systems [will no longer receive security updates](https://doublepulsar.com/important-information-about-microsoft-meltdown-cpu-security-fixes-antivirus-vendors-and-you-a852ba0292ec) via Windows Update if they are not running compliant anti-virus software. As with deploying any software updates, be sure to prioritize and test updates as necessary.

**Consider CPU Options**

Initial reports from the field indicate that overall system performance is impacted by many of the available patches for these vulnerabilities. Depending on the software workflow and the CPU capabilities present, the performance impact of software mitigations may be non-trivial and therefore may become an ongoing operational concern for some organizations. While we recognize that replacing existing CPUs in already deployed systems is not practical, organizations acquiring new systems should evaluate their CPU selection in light of the expected longevity of this vulnerability in available hardware as well as the performance impacts resulting from the various platform-specific software patches. Deployment contexts and performance requirements vary widely, and must be balanced by informed evaluation of the associated security risks. Contact your system vendor to determine if the CPU and operating system combination will experience a performance penalty due to software mitigations for these vulnerabilities.

# USN-3516-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

5 January 2018

Firefox could be made to expose sensitive information.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 17.04](/security/notices?release=zesty)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

It was discovered that speculative execution performed by modern CPUs

could leak information through a timing side-channel attack, and that

this could be exploited in web browser JavaScript engines. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from other

domains, bypassing same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715),

[CVE-2017-5753](/security/CVE-2017-5753), [CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754)).

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

Hi again,

This is version two of the patches previously posted here:

  [http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/201...](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2017-November/542751.html)

Changes since v1 include:

  * Based on v4.15-rc1
  * Trampoline moved into FIXMAP area
  * Explicit static key replaced by cpu cap
  * Disable SPE for userspace profiling if kernel unmapped at EL0
  * Changed polarity of cpu feature to match config option
  * Changed command-line option so we can force on in future if necessary
  * Changed Falkor workaround to invalidate different page within 2MB region
  * Reworked alternative sequences in entry.S, since the NOP slides with
    kaiser=off were measurable

I experimented with leaving the vbar set to point at the kaiser vectors,
but I couldn't measure any performance improvement from that and it made
the code slightly more complicated, so I've left it as-is.

Patches based on 4.15-rc1 and also pushed here:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/will/linux.git kaiser

Feedback welcome, particularly on a better name for the command-line option.

Abstract

The security of computer systems fundamentally relies
on memory isolation, e.g., kernel address ranges are
marked as non-accessible and are protected from user
access. In this paper, we present Meltdown. Meltdown
exploits side effects of out-of-order execution on mod-
ern processors to read arbitrary kernel-memory locations
including personal data and passwords. Out-of-order
execution is an indispensable performance feature and
present in a wide range of modern processors. The attack
is independent of the operating system, and it does not
rely on any software vulnerabilities. Meltdown breaks
all security guarantees provided by address space isola-
tion as well as paravirtualized environments and, thus,
every security mechanism building upon this foundation.
On affected systems, Meltdown enables an adversary to
read memory of other processes or virtual machines in
the cloud without any permissions or privileges, affect-
ing millions of customers and virtually every user of a
personal computer. We show that the KAISER defense
mechanism for KASLR has the important (but inadver-
tent) side effect of impeding Meltdown. We stress that
KAISER must be deployed immediately to prevent large-
scale exploitation of this severe information leakage.

Introduction

A central security feature of today’s operating systems
is memory isolation. Operating systems ensure that user
programs cannot access each other’s memory or kernel
memory. This isolation is a cornerstone of our computing
environments and allows running multiple applications at
the same time on personal devices or executing processes
of multiple users on a single machine in the cloud.

On modern processors, the isolation between the ker-
nel and user processes is typically realized by a supervi-

sity of Pennsylvania and University of Maryland.

sor bit of the processor that deﬁnes whether a memory
page of the kernel can be accessed or not. The basic
idea is that this bit can only be set when entering kernel
code and it is cleared when switching to user processes.
This hardware feature allows operating systems to map
the kernel into the address space of every process and
to have very efﬁcient transitions from the user process
to the kernel, e.g., for interrupt handling. Consequently,
in practice, there is no change of the memory mapping
when switching from a user process to the kernel.

In this work, we present Meltdown10. Meltdown is
a novel attack that allows overcoming memory isolation
completely by providing a simple way for any user pro-
cess to read the entire kernel memory of the machine it
executes on, including all physical memory mapped in
the kernel region. Meltdown does not exploit any soft-
ware vulnerability, i.e., it works on all major operating
systems. Instead, Meltdown exploits side-channel infor-
mation available on most modern processors, e.g., mod-
ern Intel microarchitectures since 2010 and potentially
on other CPUs of other vendors.

While side-channel attacks typically require very spe-
ciﬁc knowledge about the target application and are tai-
lored to only leak information about its secrets, Melt-
down allows an adversary who can run code on the vul-
nerable processor to obtain a dump of the entire kernel
address space, including any mapped physical memory.
The root cause of the simplicity and strength of Melt-
down are side effects caused by out-of-order execution.
Out-of-order execution is an important performance
feature of today’s processors in order to overcome laten-
cies of busy execution units, e.g., a memory fetch unit
needs to wait for data arrival from memory. Instead of
stalling the execution, modern processors run operations

10Using the practice of responsible disclosure, disjoint groups of au-
thors of this paper provided preliminary versions of our results to par-
tially overlapping groups of CPU vendors and other affected compa-
nies. In coordination with industry, the authors participated in an em-
bargo of the results. Meltdown is documented under CVE-2017-5754.

out-of-order i.e., they look ahead and schedule subse-
quent operations to idle execution units of the core. How-
ever, such operations often have unwanted side-effects,
e.g., timing differences [55, 63, 23] can leak information
from both sequential and out-of-order execution.

From a security perspective, one observation is partic-
ularly signiﬁcant: vulnerable out-of-order CPUs allow
an unprivileged process to load data from a privileged
(kernel or physical) address into a temporary CPU regis-
ter. Moreover, the CPU even performs further computa-
tions based on this register value, e.g., access to an array
based on the register value. By simply discarding the
results of the memory lookups (e.g., the modiﬁed regis-
ter states), if it turns out that an instruction should not
have been executed, the processor ensures correct pro-
gram execution. Hence, on the architectural level (e.g.,
the abstract deﬁnition of how the processor should per-
form computations) no security problem arises.

However, we observed that out-of-order memory
lookups inﬂuence the cache, which in turn can be de-
tected through the cache side channel. As a result, an
attacker can dump the entire kernel memory by reading
privileged memory in an out-of-order execution stream,
and transmit the data from this elusive state via a mi-
croarchitectural covert channel (e.g., Flush+Reload) to
the outside world. On the receiving end of the covert
channel, the register value is reconstructed. Hence, on
the microarchitectural level (e.g., the actual hardware im-
plementation), there is an exploitable security problem.
Meltdown breaks all security guarantees provided by
the CPU’s memory isolation capabilities. We evaluated
the attack on modern desktop machines and laptops, as
well as servers in the cloud. Meltdown allows an unpriv-
ileged process to read data mapped in the kernel address
space, including the entire physical memory on Linux,
Android and OS X, and a large fraction of the physi-
cal memory on Windows. This may include the physical
memory of other processes, the kernel, and in the case
of kernel-sharing sandbox solutions (e.g., Docker, LXC)
or Xen in paravirtualization mode, the memory of the
kernel (or hypervisor), and other co-located instances.
While the performance heavily depends on the speciﬁc
machine, e.g., processor speed, TLB and cache sizes, and
DRAM speed, we can dump arbitrary kernel and physi-
cal memory with 3.2 KB/s to 503 KB/s. Hence, an enor-
mous number of systems are affected.

The countermeasure KAISER [20], developed initially
to prevent side-channel attacks targeting KASLR, inad-
vertently protects against Meltdown as well. Our evalu-
ation shows that KAISER prevents Meltdown to a large
extent. Consequently, we stress that it is of utmost im-
portance to deploy KAISER on all operating systems im-
mediately. Fortunately, during a responsible disclosure
window, the three major operating systems (Windows,

Linux, and OS X) implemented variants of KAISER and
recently rolled out these patches.

Meltdown is distinct from the Spectre Attacks [40] in
several ways, notably that Spectre requires tailoring to
the victim process’s software environment, but applies
more broadly to CPUs and is not mitigated by KAISER.

Contributions. The contributions of this work are:
1. We describe out-of-order execution as a new, ex-
tremely powerful, software-based side channel.
2. We show how out-of-order execution can be com-
bined with a microarchitectural covert channel to
transfer the data from an elusive state to a receiver
on the outside.

3. We present an end-to-end attack combining out-of-
order execution with exception handlers or TSX, to
read arbitrary physical memory without any permis-
sions or privileges, on laptops, desktop machines,
mobile phones and on public cloud machines.

4. We evaluate the performance of Meltdown and the

effects of KAISER on it.

Outline. The remainder of this paper is structured as
follows: In Section 2, we describe the fundamental prob-
lem which is introduced with out-of-order execution. In
Section 3, we provide a toy example illustrating the side
channel Meltdown exploits. In Section 4, we describe the
building blocks of Meltdown. We present the full attack
in Section 5. In Section 6, we evaluate the performance
of the Meltdown attack on several different systems and
discuss its limitations. In Section 7, we discuss the ef-
fects of the software-based KAISER countermeasure and
propose solutions in hardware. In Section 8, we discuss
related work and conclude our work in Section 9.

2 Background

In this section, we provide background on out-of-order
execution, address translation, and cache attacks.

2.1 Out-of-order execution

Out-of-order execution is an optimization technique that
allows maximizing the utilization of all execution units
of a CPU core as exhaustive as possible. Instead of pro-
cessing instructions strictly in the sequential program or-
der, the CPU executes them as soon as all required re-
sources are available. While the execution unit of the
current operation is occupied, other execution units can
run ahead. Hence, instructions can be run in parallel as
long as their results follow the architectural deﬁnition.

In practice, CPUs supporting out-of-order execution
allow running operations speculatively to the extent that

bus (CDB). If an operand is not available, the reservation
unit can listen on the CDB until it is available and then
directly begin the execution of the instruction.

On the Intel architecture, the pipeline consists of the
front-end, the execution engine (back-end) and the mem-
ory subsystem [32]. x86 instructions are fetched by the
front-end from memory and decoded to micro-operations
(µOPs) which are continuously sent to the execution en-
gine. Out-of-order execution is implemented within the
execution engine as illustrated in Figure 1. The Reorder
Buffer is responsible for register allocation, register re-
naming and retiring. Additionally, other optimizations
like move elimination or the recognition of zeroing id-
ioms are directly handled by the reorder buffer. The
µOPs are forwarded to the Uniﬁed Reservation Station
(Scheduler) that queues the operations on exit ports that
are connected to Execution Units. Each execution unit
can perform different tasks like ALU operations, AES
operations, address generation units (AGU) or memory
loads and stores. AGUs, as well as load and store execu-
tion units, are directly connected to the memory subsys-
tem to process its requests.

Since CPUs usually do not run linear instruction
streams, they have branch prediction units that are used
to obtain an educated guess of which instruction is ex-
ecuted next. Branch predictors try to determine which
direction of a branch is taken before its condition is ac-
tually evaluated. Instructions that lie on that path and do
not have any dependencies can be executed in advance
and their results immediately used if the prediction was
correct. If the prediction was incorrect, the reorder buffer
allows to rollback to a sane state by clearing the reorder
buffer and re-initializing the uniﬁed reservation station.
There are various approaches to predict a branch: With
static branch prediction [28], the outcome is predicted
solely based on the instruction itself. Dynamic branch
prediction [8] gathers statistics at run-time to predict the
outcome. One-level branch prediction uses a 1-bit or 2-
bit counter to record the last outcome of a branch [45].
Modern processors often use two-level adaptive predic-
tors [64] with a history of the last n outcomes, allowing to
predict regularly recurring patterns. More recently, ideas
to use neural branch prediction [62, 38, 60] have been
picked up and integrated into CPU architectures [9].

2.2 Address Spaces

To isolate processes from each other, CPUs support vir-
tual address spaces where virtual addresses are translated
to physical addresses. A virtual address space is divided
into a set of pages that can be individually mapped to
physical memory through a multi-level page translation
table. The translation tables deﬁne the actual virtual
to physical mapping and also protection properties that

tel’s Skylake microarchitecture. Instructions are decoded
into µOPs and executed out-of-order in the execution en-
gine by individual execution units.

the processor’s out-of-order logic processes instructions
before the CPU is certain that the instruction will be
needed and committed. In this paper, we refer to spec-
ulative execution in a more restricted meaning, where it
refers to an instruction sequence following a branch, and
use the term out-of-order execution to refer to any way
of getting an operation executed before the processor has
committed the results of all prior instructions.

In 1967, Tomasulo [61] developed an algorithm that
enabled dynamic scheduling of instructions to allow out-
of-order execution. Tomasulo [61] introduced a uniﬁed
reservation station that allows a CPU to use a data value
as it has been computed instead of storing it in a reg-
ister and re-reading it. The reservation station renames
registers to allow instructions that operate on the same
physical registers to use the last logical one to solve read-
after-write (RAW), write-after-read (WAR) and write-
after-write (WAW) hazards. Furthermore, the reserva-
tion unit connects all execution units via a common data

are used to enforce privilege checks, such as readable,
writable, executable and user-accessible. The currently
used translation table is held in a special CPU register.
On each context switch, the operating system updates
this register with the next process’ translation table ad-
dress in order to implement per-process virtual address
spaces. Because of that, each process can only reference
data that belongs to its virtual address space. Each vir-
tual address space itself is split into a user and a kernel
part. While the user address space can be accessed by the
running application, the kernel address space can only be
accessed if the CPU is running in privileged mode. This
is enforced by the operating system disabling the user-
accessible property of the corresponding translation ta-
bles. The kernel address space does not only have mem-
ory mapped for the kernel’s own usage, but it also needs
to perform operations on user pages, e.g., ﬁlling them
with data. Consequently, the entire physical memory is
typically mapped in the kernel. On Linux and OS X, this
is done via a direct-physical map, i.e., the entire physi-
cal memory is directly mapped to a pre-deﬁned virtual
address (cf. Figure 2).

Instead of a direct-physical map, Windows maintains
a multiple so-called paged pools, non-paged pools, and
the system cache. These pools are virtual memory re-
gions in the kernel address space mapping physical pages
to virtual addresses which are either required to remain
in the memory (non-paged pool) or can be removed from
the memory because a copy is already stored on the disk
(paged pool). The system cache further contains map-
pings of all ﬁle-backed pages. Combined, these memory
pools will typically map a large fraction of the physical
memory into the kernel address space of every process.

The exploitation of memory corruption bugs often re-
quires knowledge of addresses of speciﬁc data.
In or-
der to impede such attacks, address space layout ran-
domization (ASLR) has been introduced as well as non-
executable stacks and stack canaries. To protect the
kernel, kernel ASLR (KASLR) randomizes the offsets
where drivers are located on every boot, making attacks
harder as they now require to guess the location of kernel

data structures. However, side-channel attacks allow to
detect the exact location of kernel data structures [21, 29,
37] or derandomize ASLR in JavaScript [16]. A com-
bination of a software bug and the knowledge of these
addresses can lead to privileged code execution.

2.3 Cache Attacks

In order to speed-up memory accesses and address trans-
lation, the CPU contains small memory buffers, called
caches, that store frequently used data. CPU caches hide
slow memory access latencies by buffering frequently
used data in smaller and faster internal memory. Mod-
ern CPUs have multiple levels of caches that are either
private per core or shared among them. Address space
translation tables are also stored in memory and, thus,
also cached in the regular caches.

Cache side-channel attacks exploit timing differences
that are introduced by the caches. Different cache attack
techniques have been proposed and demonstrated in the
past, including Evict+Time [55], Prime+Probe [55, 56],
and Flush+Reload [63]. Flush+Reload attacks work on
a single cache line granularity. These attacks exploit the
shared, inclusive last-level cache. An attacker frequently
ﬂushes a targeted memory location using the clflush
instruction. By measuring the time it takes to reload the
data, the attacker determines whether data was loaded
into the cache by another process in the meantime. The
Flush+Reload attack has been used for attacks on various
computations, e.g., cryptographic algorithms [63, 36, 4],
web server function calls [65], user input [23, 47, 58],
and kernel addressing information [21].

A special use case of a side-channel attack is a covert
channel. Here the attacker controls both, the part that in-
duces the side effect, and the part that measures the side
effect. This can be used to leak information from one
security domain to another, while bypassing any bound-
aries existing on the architectural level or above. Both
Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload have been used in high-
performance covert channels [48, 52, 22].

3 A Toy Example

In this section, we start with a toy example, i.e., a simple
code snippet, to illustrate that out-of-order execution can
change the microarchitectural state in a way that leaks
information. However, despite its simplicity, it is used as
a basis for Section 4 and Section 5, where we show how
this change in state can be exploited for an attack.

Listing 1 shows a simple code snippet ﬁrst raising an
(unhandled) exception and then accessing an array. The
property of an exception is that the control ﬂow does not
continue with the code after the exception, but jumps to
an exception handler in the operating system. Regardless

Physicalmemory0maxUser0247Kernel−247−11 raise_exception();
2 // the line below is never reached
3 access(probe_array[data * 4096]);

Listing 1: A toy example to illustrate side-effects of out-
of-order execution.

Figure 3: If an executed instruction causes an exception,
diverting the control ﬂow to an exception handler, the
subsequent instruction must not be executed. Due to out-
of-order execution, the subsequent instructions may al-
ready have been partially executed, but not retired. How-
ever, architectural effects of the execution are discarded.

of whether this exception is raised due to a memory ac-
cess, e.g., by accessing an invalid address, or due to any
other CPU exception, e.g., a division by zero, the control
ﬂow continues in the kernel and not with the next user
space instruction.

Thus, our toy example cannot access the array in the-
ory, as the exception immediately traps to the kernel and
terminates the application. However, due to the out-of-
order execution, the CPU might have already executed
the following instructions as there is no dependency on
the instruction triggering the exception. This is illus-
trated in Figure 3. Due to the exception, the instructions
executed out of order are not retired and, thus, never have
architectural effects.

Although the instructions executed out of order do not
have any visible architectural effect on registers or mem-
ory, they have microarchitectural side effects. During the
out-of-order execution, the referenced memory is fetched
into a register and also stored in the cache. If the out-
of-order execution has to be discarded, the register and
memory contents are never committed. Nevertheless, the
cached memory contents are kept in the cache. We can
leverage a microarchitectural side-channel attack such
as Flush+Reload [63], which detects whether a speciﬁc
memory location is cached, to make this microarchitec-
tural state visible. Other side channels can also detect
whether a speciﬁc memory location is cached, including
Prime+Probe [55, 48, 52], Evict+Reload [47], or Flush+
Flush [22]. As Flush+Reload is the most accurate known
cache side channel and is simple to implement, we do not
consider any other side channel for this example.

Figure 4: Even if a memory location is only accessed
during out-of-order execution, it remains cached. Iterat-
ing over the 256 pages of probe array shows one cache
hit, exactly on the page that was accessed during the out-
of-order execution.

Based on the value of data in this example, a different
part of the cache is accessed when executing the memory
access out of order. As data is multiplied by 4096, data
accesses to probe array are scattered over the array
with a distance of 4 KB (assuming an 1 B data type for
probe array). Thus, there is an injective mapping from
the value of data to a memory page, i.e., different values
for data never result in an access to the same page. Con-
sequently, if a cache line of a page is cached, we know
the value of data. The spreading over pages eliminates
false positives due to the prefetcher, as the prefetcher
cannot access data across page boundaries [32].

Figure 4 shows the result of a Flush+Reload measure-
ment iterating over all pages, after executing the out-of-
order snippet with data = 84. Although the array ac-
cess should not have happened due to the exception, we
can clearly see that the index which would have been ac-
cessed is cached.
Iterating over all pages (e.g., in the
exception handler) shows only a cache hit for page 84
This shows that even instructions which are never actu-
ally executed, change the microarchitectural state of the
CPU. Section 4 modiﬁes this toy example not to read a
value but to leak an inaccessible secret.

4 Building Blocks of the Attack

The toy example in Section 3 illustrated that side-effects
of out-of-order execution can modify the microarchitec-
tural state to leak information. While the code snippet
reveals the data value passed to a cache-side channel, we
want to show how this technique can be leveraged to leak
otherwise inaccessible secrets. In this section, we want
to generalize and discuss the necessary building blocks
to exploit out-of-order execution for an attack.

The adversary targets a secret value that is kept some-
where in physical memory. Note that register contents
are also stored in memory upon context switches, i.e.,
they are also stored in physical memory. As described in
Section 2.2, the address space of every process typically
includes the entire user space, as well as the entire kernel

with a dependency on a secret value.

The second building block of Meltdown is to transfer
the microarchitectural side effect of the transient instruc-
tion sequence to an architectural state to further process
the leaked secret. Thus, the second building described
in Section 4.2 describes building blocks to transfer a mi-
croarchitectural side effect to an architectural state using
a covert channel.

4.1 Executing Transient Instructions

The ﬁrst building block of Meltdown is the execution
of transient instructions. Transient instructions occur all
the time, as the CPU continuously runs ahead of the
current instruction to minimize the experienced latency
and, thus, to maximize the performance (cf. Section 2.1).
Transient instructions introduce an exploitable side chan-
nel if their operation depends on a secret value. We focus
on addresses that are mapped within the attacker’s pro-
cess, i.e., the user-accessible user space addresses as well
as the user-inaccessible kernel space addresses. Note that
attacks targeting code that is executed within the context
(i.e., address space) of another process are possible [40],
but out of scope in this work, since all physical memory
(including the memory of other processes) can be read
through the kernel address space regardless.

Accessing user-inaccessible pages, such as kernel
pages, triggers an exception which generally terminates
the application. If the attacker targets a secret at a user-
inaccessible address, the attacker has to cope with this
exception. We propose two approaches: With excep-
tion handling, we catch the exception effectively occur-
ring after executing the transient instruction sequence,
and with exception suppression, we prevent the excep-
tion from occurring at all and instead redirect the control
ﬂow after executing the transient instruction sequence.
We discuss these approaches in detail in the following.

Exception handling. A trivial approach is to fork the
attacking application before accessing the invalid mem-
ory location that terminates the process and only access
the invalid memory location in the child process. The
CPU executes the transient instruction sequence in the
child process before crashing. The parent process can
then recover the secret by observing the microarchitec-
tural state, e.g., through a side-channel.

It is also possible to install a signal handler that is exe-
cuted when a certain exception occurs, e.g., a segmenta-
tion fault. This allows the attacker to issue the instruction
sequence and prevent the application from crashing, re-
ducing the overhead as no new process has to be created.

Figure 5: The Meltdown attack uses exception handling
or suppression, e.g., TSX, to run a series of transient in-
structions. These transient instructions obtain a (persis-
tent) secret value and change the microarchitectural state
of the processor based on this secret value. This forms
the sending part of a microarchitectural covert chan-
nel. The receiving side reads the microarchitectural state,
making it architectural and recovers the secret value.

space, which typically also has all physical memory (in-
use) mapped. However, these memory regions are only
accessible in privileged mode (cf. Section 2.2).

In this work, we demonstrate leaking secrets by by-
passing the privileged-mode isolation, giving an attacker
full read access to the entire kernel space, including
any physical memory mapped and, thus, the physical
memory of any other process and the kernel. Note that
Kocher et al. [40] pursue an orthogonal approach, called
Spectre Attacks, which trick speculatively executed in-
structions into leaking information that the victim pro-
cess is authorized to access. As a result, Spectre Attacks
lack the privilege escalation aspect of Meltdown and re-
quire tailoring to the victim process’s software environ-
ment, but apply more broadly to CPUs that support spec-
ulative execution and are not prevented by KAISER.

The full Meltdown attack consists of two building
blocks, as illustrated in Figure 5. The ﬁrst building block
of Meltdown is to make the CPU execute one or more
instructions that would never occur in the executed path.
In the toy example (cf. Section 3), this is an access to
an array, which would normally never be executed, as
the previous instruction always raises an exception. We
call such an instruction, which is executed out of order
and leaving measurable side effects, a transient instruc-
tion. Furthermore, we call any sequence of instructions
containing at least one transient instruction a transient
instruction sequence.

In order to leverage transient instructions for an attack,
the transient instruction sequence must utilize a secret
value that an attacker wants to leak. Section 4.1 describes

ExceptionHandling/SuppressionTransientInstructionsSecretMicroarchitecturalStateChangeSection4.1ArchitecturalStateTransfer(CovertChannel)RecoveredSecretRecoveryLeakedAccessedSection4.2Exception suppression. A different approach to deal
with exceptions is to prevent them from being raised in
the ﬁrst place. Transactional memory allows to group
memory accesses into one seemingly atomic operation,
giving the option to roll-back to a previous state if an er-
ror occurs. If an exception occurs within the transaction,
the architectural state is reset, and the program execution
continues without disruption.

Furthermore, speculative execution issues instructions
that might not occur on the executed code path due to
a branch misprediction. Such instructions depending on
a preceding conditional branch can be speculatively ex-
ecuted. Thus, the invalid memory access is put within
a speculative instruction sequence that is only executed
if a prior branch condition evaluates to true. By making
sure that the condition never evaluates to true in the ex-
ecuted code path, we can suppress the occurring excep-
tion as the memory access is only executed speculatively.
This technique may require sophisticated training of the
branch predictor. Kocher et al. [40] pursue this approach
in orthogonal work, since this construct can frequently
be found in code of other processes.

4.2 Building a Covert Channel

The second building block of Meltdown is the transfer
of the microarchitectural state, which was changed by
the transient instruction sequence, into an architectural
state (cf. Figure 5). The transient instruction sequence
can be seen as the sending end of a microarchitectural
covert channel. The receiving end of the covert channel
receives the microarchitectural state change and deduces
the secret from the state. Note that the receiver is not
part of the transient instruction sequence and can be a
different thread or even a different process e.g., the parent
process in the fork-and-crash approach.

We leverage techniques from cache attacks, as the
cache state is a microarchitectural state which can be re-
liably transferred into an architectural state using vari-
ous techniques [55, 63, 22]. Speciﬁcally, we use Flush+
Reload [63], as it allows to build a fast and low-noise
covert channel. Thus, depending on the secret value, the
transient instruction sequence (cf. Section 4.1) performs
a regular memory access, e.g., as it does in the toy exam-
ple (cf. Section 3).

After the transient instruction sequence accessed an
accessible address, i.e., this is the sender of the covert
channel; the address is cached for subsequent accesses.
The receiver can then monitor whether the address has
been loaded into the cache by measuring the access time
to the address. Thus, the sender can transmit a ‘1’-bit by
accessing an address which is loaded into the monitored
cache, and a ‘0’-bit by not accessing such an address.

Using multiple different cache lines, as in our toy ex-
ample in Section 3, allows to transmit multiple bits at
once. For every of the 256 different byte values, the
sender accesses a different cache line. By performing
a Flush+Reload attack on all of the 256 possible cache
lines, the receiver can recover a full byte instead of just
one bit. However, since the Flush+Reload attack takes
much longer (typically several hundred cycles) than the
transient instruction sequence, transmitting only a single
bit at once is more efﬁcient. The attacker can simply do
that by shifting and masking the secret value accordingly.
Note that the covert channel is not limited to microar-
chitectural states which rely on the cache. Any microar-
chitectural state which can be inﬂuenced by an instruc-
tion (sequence) and is observable through a side channel
can be used to build the sending end of a covert channel.
The sender could, for example, issue an instruction (se-
quence) which occupies a certain execution port such as
the ALU to send a ‘1’-bit. The receiver measures the la-
tency when executing an instruction (sequence) on the
same execution port. A high latency implies that the
sender sends a ‘1’-bit, whereas a low latency implies
that sender sends a ‘0’-bit. The advantage of the Flush+
Reload cache covert channel is the noise resistance and
the high transmission rate [22]. Furthermore, the leakage
can be observed from any CPU core [63], i.e., reschedul-
ing events do not signiﬁcantly affect the covert channel.

5 Meltdown

In this section, we present Meltdown, a powerful at-
tack allowing to read arbitrary physical memory from
an unprivileged user program, comprised of the build-
ing blocks presented in Section 4. First, we discuss the
attack setting to emphasize the wide applicability of this
attack. Second, we present an attack overview, show-
ing how Meltdown can be mounted on both Windows
and Linux on personal computers, on Android on mo-
bile phones as well as in the cloud. Finally, we discuss a
concrete implementation of Meltdown allowing to dump
arbitrary kernel memory with 3.2 KB/s to 503 KB/s.

In our attack, we consider personal

computers and virtual machines in the cloud.
In the
attack scenario, the attacker has arbitrary unprivileged
code execution on the attacked system, i.e., the attacker
can run any code with the privileges of a normal user.
However, the attacker has no physical access to the ma-
chine. Furthermore, we assume that the system is fully
protected with state-of-the-art software-based defenses
such as ASLR and KASLR as well as CPU features like
SMAP, SMEP, NX, and PXN. Most importantly, we as-
sume a completely bug-free operating system, thus, no

software vulnerability exists that can be exploited to gain
kernel privileges or leak information. The attacker tar-
gets secret user data, e.g., passwords and private keys, or
any other valuable information.

5.1 Attack Description

Meltdown combines the two building blocks discussed
in Section 4. First, an attacker makes the CPU execute
a transient instruction sequence which uses an inacces-
sible secret value stored somewhere in physical memory
(cf. Section 4.1). The transient instruction sequence acts
as the transmitter of a covert channel (cf. Section 4.2),
ultimately leaking the secret value to the attacker.

Meltdown consists of 3 steps:

Step 1 The content of an attacker-chosen memory loca-
tion, which is inaccessible to the attacker, is loaded
into a register.
Step 2 A transient

instruction accesses a cache line

based on the secret content of the register.

Step 3 The attacker uses Flush+Reload to determine the
accessed cache line and hence the secret stored at the
chosen memory location.

By repeating these steps for different memory locations,
the attacker can dump the kernel memory, including the
entire physical memory.

Listing 2 shows the basic implementation of the tran-
sient instruction sequence and the sending part of the
covert channel, using x86 assembly instructions. Note
that this part of the attack could also be implemented en-
tirely in higher level languages like C. In the following,
we will discuss each step of Meltdown and the corre-
sponding code line in Listing 2.

Step 1: Reading the secret. To load data from the
main memory into a register, the data in the main mem-
ory is referenced using a virtual address. In parallel to
translating a virtual address into a physical address, the
CPU also checks the permission bits of the virtual ad-

dress, i.e., whether this virtual address is user accessible
or only accessible by the kernel. As already discussed in
Section 2.2, this hardware-based isolation through a per-
mission bit is considered secure and recommended by the
hardware vendors. Hence, modern operating systems al-
ways map the entire kernel into the virtual address space
of every user process.

As a consequence, all kernel addresses lead to a valid
physical address when translating them, and the CPU can
access the content of such addresses. The only differ-
ence to accessing a user space address is that the CPU
raises an exception as the current permission level does
not allow to access such an address. Hence, the user
space cannot simply read the contents of such an address.
However, Meltdown exploits the out-of-order execution
of modern CPUs, which still executes instructions in the
small time window between the illegal memory access
and the raising of the exception.

In line 4 of Listing 2, we load the byte value located
at the target kernel address, stored in the RCX register,
into the least signiﬁcant byte of the RAX register repre-
sented by AL. As explained in more detail in Section 2.1,
the MOV instruction is fetched by the core, decoded into
µOPs, allocated, and sent to the reorder buffer. There, ar-
chitectural registers (e.g., RAX and RCX in Listing 2) are
mapped to underlying physical registers enabling out-of-
order execution. Trying to utilize the pipeline as much as
possible, subsequent instructions (lines 5-7) are already
decoded and allocated as µOPs as well. The µOPs are
further sent to the reservation station holding the µOPs
while they wait to be executed by the corresponding ex-
ecution unit. The execution of a µOP can be delayed if
execution units are already used to their corresponding
capacity, or operand values have not been computed yet.

When the kernel address is loaded in line 4, it is likely
that the CPU already issued the subsequent instructions
as part of the out-of-order execution, and that their cor-
responding µOPs wait in the reservation station for the
content of the kernel address to arrive. As soon as the
fetched data is observed on the common data bus, the
µOPs can begin their execution. Furthermore, processor
interconnects [31, 3] and cache coherence protocols [59]
guarantee that the most recent value of a memory address
is read, regardless of the storage location in a multi-core
or multi-CPU system.

When the µOPs ﬁnish their execution, they retire in-
order, and, thus, their results are committed to the archi-
tectural state. During the retirement, any interrupts and
exceptions that occurred during the execution of the in-
struction are handled. Thus, if the MOV instruction that
loads the kernel address is retired, the exception is regis-
tered, and the pipeline is ﬂushed to eliminate all results
of subsequent instructions which were executed out of

order. However, there is a race condition between raising
this exception and our attack step 2 as described below.
As reported by Gruss et al. [21], prefetching kernel ad-
dresses sometimes succeeds. We found that prefetching
the kernel address can slightly improve the performance
of the attack on some systems.

Step 2: Transmitting the secret. The instruction se-
quence from step 1 which is executed out of order has to
be chosen in a way that it becomes a transient instruction
sequence. If this transient instruction sequence is exe-
cuted before the MOV instruction is retired (i.e., raises the
exception), and the transient instruction sequence per-
formed computations based on the secret, it can be uti-
lized to transmit the secret to the attacker.

As already discussed, we utilize cache attacks that al-
low building fast and low-noise covert channels using the
CPU’s cache. Thus, the transient instruction sequence
has to encode the secret into the microarchitectural cache
state, similar to the toy example in Section 3.

We allocate a probe array in memory and ensure that
no part of this array is cached. To transmit the secret, the
transient instruction sequence contains an indirect mem-
ory access to an address which is computed based on the
secret (inaccessible) value. In line 5 of Listing 2, the se-
cret value from step 1 is multiplied by the page size, i.e.,
4 KB. The multiplication of the secret ensures that ac-
cesses to the array have a large spatial distance to each
other. This prevents the hardware prefetcher from load-
ing adjacent memory locations into the cache as well.
Here, we read a single byte at once. Hence, our probe
array is 256

4096 bytes, assuming 4 KB pages.

Note that in the out-of-order execution we have a
noise-bias towards register value ‘0’. We discuss the rea-
sons for this in Section 5.2. However, for this reason, we
introduce a retry-logic into the transient instruction se-
quence. In case we read a ‘0’, we try to reread the secret
(step 1). In line 7, the multiplied secret is added to the
base address of the probe array, forming the target ad-
dress of the covert channel. This address is read to cache
the corresponding cache line. The address will be loaded
into the L1 data cache of the requesting core and, due to
the inclusiveness, also the L3 cache where it can be read
from other cores. Consequently, our transient instruction
sequence affects the cache state based on the secret value
that was read in step 1.

Since the transient instruction sequence in step 2 races
against raising the exception, reducing the runtime of
step 2 can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the
attack. For instance, taking care that the address trans-
lation for the probe array is cached in the translation-
lookaside buffer (TLB) increases the attack performance
on some systems.

In step 3, the attacker
Step 3: Receiving the secret.
recovers the secret value (step 1) by leveraging a mi-
croarchitectural side-channel attack (i.e., the receiving
end of a microarchitectural covert channel) that transfers
the cache state (step 2) back into an architectural state.
As discussed in Section 4.2, our implementation of Melt-
down relies on Flush+Reload for this purpose.

When the transient instruction sequence of step 2 is
executed, exactly one cache line of the probe array is
cached. The position of the cached cache line within the
probe array depends only on the secret which is read in
step 1. Thus, the attacker iterates over all 256 pages of
the probe array and measures the access time for every
ﬁrst cache line (i.e., offset) on the page. The number of
the page containing the cached cache line corresponds
directly to the secret value.

Dumping the entire physical memory. Repeating all
3 steps of Meltdown, an attacker can dump the entire
memory by iterating over all addresses. However, as the
memory access to the kernel address raises an exception
that terminates the program, we use one of the methods
from Section 4.1 to handle or suppress the exception.

As all major operating systems also typically map the
entire physical memory into the kernel address space (cf.
Section 2.2) in every user process, Meltdown can also
read the entire physical memory of the target machine.

5.2 Optimizations and Limitations

Inherent bias towards 0. While CPUs generally stall
if a value is not available during an out-of-order load op-
eration [28], CPUs might continue with the out-of-order
execution by assuming a value for the load [12]. We
observed that the illegal memory load in our Meltdown
implementation (line 4 in Listing 2) often returns a ‘0’,
which can be clearly observed when implemented using
an add instruction instead of the mov. The reason for this
bias to ‘0’ may either be that the memory load is masked
out by a failed permission check, or a speculated value
because the data of the stalled load is not available yet.

This inherent bias results from the race condition in
the out-of-order execution, which may be won (i.e., reads
the correct value), but is often lost (i.e., reads a value of
‘0’). This bias varies between different machines as well
as hardware and software conﬁgurations and the speciﬁc

implementation of Meltdown.
sion, the probability that a value of ’0’ is erroneously
returned is high. Consequently, our Meltdown imple-
mentation performs a certain number of retries when the
code in Listing 2 results in reading a value of ‘0’ from the
Flush+Reload attack. The maximum number of retries is
an optimization parameter inﬂuencing the attack perfor-
mance and the error rate. On the Intel Core i5-6200U

using exeception handling, we read a ’0’ on average in
5.25 % (σ = 4.15) with our unoptimized version. With
a simple retry loop, we reduced the probability to 0.67 %
(σ = 1.47). On the Core i7-8700K, we read on average
a ’0’ in 1.78 % (σ = 3.07). Using Intel TSX, the proba-
bility is further reduced to 0.008 %.

the number of bits read and transmitted at once is a trade-
off between some implicit error-reduction and the overall
transmission rate of the covert channel.

However, since the error rates are quite small in either
case, our evaluation (cf. Section 6) is based on the single-
bit transmission mechanics.

Optimizing the case of 0. Due to the inherent bias of
Meltdown, a cache hit on cache line ‘0’ in the Flush+
Reload measurement, does not provide the attacker with
any information. Hence, measuring cache line ‘0’ can
be omitted and in case there is no cache hit on any other
cache line, the value can be assumed to be ‘0’. To min-
imize the number of cases where no cache hit on a non-
zero line occurs, we retry reading the address in the tran-
sient instruction sequence until it encounters a value dif-
ferent from ‘0’ (line 6). This loop is terminated either
by reading a non-zero value or by the raised exception of
the invalid memory access. In either case, the time un-
til exception handling or exception suppression returns
the control ﬂow is independent of the loop after the in-
valid memory access, i.e., the loop does not slow down
the attack measurably. Hence, these optimizations may
increase the attack performance.

In the attack description in
Single-bit transmission.
Section 5.1, the attacker transmitted 8 bits through the
covert channel at once and performed 28 = 256 Flush+
Reload measurements to recover the secret. However,
there is a trade-off between running more transient in-
struction sequences and performing more Flush+Reload
measurements. The attacker could transmit an arbitrary
number of bits in a single transmission through the covert
channel, by reading more bits using a MOV instruction for
a larger data value. Furthermore, the attacker could mask
bits using additional instructions in the transient instruc-
tion sequence. We found the number of additional in-
structions in the transient instruction sequence to have a
negligible inﬂuence on the performance of the attack.

The performance bottleneck in the generic attack de-
scribed above is indeed, the time spent on Flush+Reload
measurements. In fact, with this implementation, almost
the entire time is spent on Flush+Reload measurements.
By transmitting only a single bit, we can omit all but
one Flush+Reload measurement, i.e., the measurement
on cache line 1.
If the transmitted bit was a ‘1’, then
we observe a cache hit on cache line 1. Otherwise, we
observe no cache hit on cache line 1.

Transmitting only a single bit at once also has draw-
backs. As described above, our side channel has a bias
If we read and transmit
towards a secret value of ‘0’.
multiple bits at once, the likelihood that all bits are ‘0’
may be quite small for actual user data. The likelihood
that a single bit is ‘0’ is typically close to 50 %. Hence,

In Sec-
Exception Suppression using Intel TSX.
tion 4.1, we discussed the option to prevent that an ex-
ception is raised due an invalid memory access. Using
Intel TSX, a hardware transactional memory implemen-
tation, we can completely suppress the exception [37].

With Intel TSX, multiple instructions can be grouped
to a transaction, which appears to be an atomic opera-
tion, i.e., either all or no instruction is executed. If one
instruction within the transaction fails, already executed
instructions are reverted, but no exception is raised.

If we wrap the code from Listing 2 with such a TSX
instruction, any exception is suppressed. However, the
microarchitectural effects are still visible, i.e., the cache
state is persistently manipulated from within the hard-
ware transaction [19]. This results in higher channel ca-
pacity, as suppressing the exception is signiﬁcantly faster
than trapping into the kernel for handling the exception,
and continuing afterward.

In 2013, kernel address space
Dealing with KASLR.
layout randomization (KASLR) was introduced to the
Linux kernel (starting from version 3.14 [11]) allowing
to randomize the location of kernel code at boot time.
However, only as recently as May 2017, KASLR was
enabled by default in version 4.12 [54]. With KASLR
also the direct-physical map is randomized and not ﬁxed
at a certain address such that the attacker is required to
obtain the randomized offset before mounting the Melt-
down attack. However, the randomization is limited to
40 bit.

Thus, if we assume a setup of the target machine with
8 GB of RAM, it is sufﬁcient to test the address space
for addresses in 8 GB steps. This allows covering the
search space of 40 bit with only 128 tests in the worst
case. If the attacker can successfully obtain a value from
a tested address, the attacker can proceed to dump the
entire memory from that location. This allows mount-
ing Meltdown on a system despite being protected by
KASLR within seconds.

leak, and Section 6.2 evaluates the performance of Melt-
down, including countermeasures. Finally, we discuss
limitations for AMD and ARM in Section 6.3.

Table 1 shows a list of conﬁgurations on which we
successfully reproduced Meltdown. For the evaluation of
Meltdown, we used both laptops as well as desktop PCs
with Intel Core CPUs and an ARM-based mobile phone.
For the cloud setup, we tested Meltdown in virtual ma-
chines running on Intel Xeon CPUs hosted in the Ama-
zon Elastic Compute Cloud as well as on DigitalOcean.
Note that for ethical reasons we did not use Meltdown on
addresses referring to physical memory of other tenants.

6.1 Leakage and Environments

We evaluated Meltdown on both Linux (cf. Sec-
tion 6.1.1), Windows 10 (cf. Section 6.1.3) and Android
(cf. Section 6.1.4), without the patches introducing the
KAISER mechanism. On these operating systems, Melt-
down can successfully leak kernel memory. We also
evaluated the effect of the KAISER patches on Meltdown
on Linux, to show that KAISER prevents the leakage of
kernel memory (cf. Section 6.1.2). Furthermore, we dis-
cuss the information leakage when running inside con-
tainers such as Docker (cf. Section 6.1.5). Finally, we
evaluate Meltdown on uncached and uncacheable mem-
ory (cf. Section 6.1.6).

6.1.1 Linux

We successfully evaluated Meltdown on multiple ver-
sions of the Linux kernel, from 2.6.32 to 4.13.0, with-
out the patches introducing the KAISER mechanism. On
all these versions of the Linux kernel, the kernel address
space is also mapped into the user address space. Thus,
all kernel addresses are also mapped into the address
space of user space applications, but any access is pre-
vented due to the permission settings for these addresses.

As Meltdown bypasses these permission settings, an at-
tacker can leak the complete kernel memory if the vir-
tual address of the kernel base is known. Since all major
operating systems also map the entire physical memory
into the kernel address space (cf. Section 2.2), all physi-
cal memory can also be read.

Before kernel 4.12, kernel address space layout ran-
domization (KASLR) was not active by default [57]. If
KASLR is active, Meltdown can still be used to ﬁnd the
kernel by searching through the address space (cf. Sec-
tion 5.2). An attacker can also simply de-randomize the
direct-physical map by iterating through the virtual ad-
dress space. Without KASLR, the direct-physical map
starts at address 0xffff 8800 0000 0000 and linearly
maps the entire physical memory. On such systems, an
attacker can use Meltdown to dump the entire physical
memory, simply by reading from virtual addresses start-
ing at 0xffff 8800 0000 0000.

On newer systems, where KASLR is active by default,
the randomization of the direct-physical map is limited
to 40 bit. It is even further limited due to the linearity of
the mapping. Assuming that the target system has at least
8 GB of physical memory, the attacker can test addresses
in steps of 8 GB, resulting in a maximum of 128 memory
locations to test. Starting from one discovered location,
the attacker can again dump the entire physical memory.

Hence, for the evaluation, we can assume that the ran-
domization is either disabled, or the offset was already
retrieved in a pre-computation step.

6.1.2 Linux with KAISER Patch

The KAISER patch by Gruss et al. [20] implements
a stronger isolation between kernel and user space.
KAISER does not map any kernel memory in the user
space, except for some parts required by the x86 archi-
tecture (e.g., interrupt handlers). Thus, there is no valid
mapping to either kernel memory or physical memory
(via the direct-physical map) in the user space, and such
addresses can therefore not be resolved. Consequently,
Meltdown cannot leak any kernel or physical memory
except for the few memory locations which have to be
mapped in user space.

We veriﬁed that KAISER indeed prevents Meltdown,
and there is no leakage of any kernel or physical memory.

Furthermore, if KASLR is active, and the few re-
maining memory locations are randomized, ﬁnding these
memory locations is not trivial due to their small size of
several kilobytes. Section 7.2 discusses the security im-
plications of these mapped memory locations.

6.1.3 Microsoft Windows

We successfully evaluated Meltdown on a recent Mi-
crosoft Windows 10 operating system, last updated just
before patches against Meltdown were rolled out. In line
with the results on Linux (cf. Section 6.1.1), Meltdown
also can leak arbitrary kernel memory on Windows. This
is not surprising, since Meltdown does not exploit any
software issues, but is caused by a hardware issue.

In contrast to Linux, Windows does not have the con-
cept of an identity mapping, which linearly maps the
physical memory into the virtual address space. Instead,
a large fraction of the physical memory is mapped in
the paged pools, non-paged pools, and the system cache.
Furthermore, Windows maps the kernel into the address
space of every application too. Thus, Meltdown can read
kernel memory which is mapped in the kernel address
space, i.e., any part of the kernel which is not swapped
out, and any page mapped in the paged and non-paged
pool, and the system cache.

Note that there are physical pages which are mapped
in one process but not in the (kernel) address space of
another process, i.e., physical pages which cannot be at-
tacked using Meltdown. However, most of the physical
memory will still be accessible through Meltdown.

We were successfully able to read the binary of the
Windows kernel using Meltdown. To verify that the
leaked data is actual kernel memory, we ﬁrst used the
Windows kernel debugger to obtain kernel addresses
containing actual data. After leaking the data, we again
used the Windows kernel debugger to compare the leaked
data with the actual memory content, conﬁrming that
Meltdown can successfully leak kernel memory.

6.1.4 Android

We successfully evaluated Meltdown on a Samsung
Galaxy S7 mohile phone running LineageOS Android
14.1 with a Linux kernel 3.18.14. The device is equipped
with a Samsung Exynos 8 Octa 8890 SoC consisting
of a ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with 4 cores as well as an
Exynos M1 ”Mongoose” CPU with 4 cores [6]. While
we were not able to mount the attack on the Cortex-
A53 CPU, we successfully mounted Meltdown on Sam-
sung’s custom cores. Using exception suppression de-
scribed in Section 4.1, we successfully leaked a pre-
deﬁned string using the direct-physical map located at
the virtual address 0xffff ffbf c000 0000.

6.1.5 Containers

We evaluated Meltdown in containers sharing a kernel,
including Docker, LXC, and OpenVZ and found that the
attack can be mounted without any restrictions. Running
Meltdown inside a container allows to leak information

not only from the underlying kernel but also from all
other containers running on the same physical host.

The commonality of most container solutions is that
every container uses the same kernel, i.e., the kernel is
shared among all containers. Thus, every container has
a valid mapping of the entire physical memory through
the direct-physical map of the shared kernel. Further-
more, Meltdown cannot be blocked in containers, as it
uses only memory accesses. Especially with Intel TSX,
only unprivileged instructions are executed without even
trapping into the kernel.

Thus, the isolation of containers sharing a kernel can
be entirely broken using Meltdown. This is especially
critical for cheaper hosting providers where users are not
separated through fully virtualized machines, but only
through containers. We veriﬁed that our attack works in
such a setup, by successfully leaking memory contents
from a container of a different user under our control.

6.1.6 Uncached and Uncacheable Memory

In this section, we evaluate whether it is a requirement
for data to be leaked by Meltdown to reside in the L1 data
cache [33]. Therefore, we constructed a setup with two
processes pinned to different physical cores. By ﬂush-
ing the value, using the clflush instruction, and only
reloading it on the other core, we create a situation where
the target data is not in the L1 data cache of the attacker
core. As described in Section 6.2, we can still leak the
data at a lower reading rate. This clearly shows that data
presence in the attacker’s L1 data cache is not a require-
ment for Meltdown. Furthermore, this observation has
also been conﬁrmed by other researchers [7, 35, 5].

The reason why Meltdown can leak uncached mem-
ory may be that Meltdown implicitly caches the data.
We devise a second experiment, where we mark pages
as uncacheable and try to leak data from them. This
has the consequence that every read or write operation to
one of those pages will directly go to the main memory,
thus, bypassing the cache. In practice, only a negligible
amount of system memory is marked uncacheable. We
observed that if the attacker is able to trigger a legitimate
load of the target address, e.g., by issuing a system call
(regular or in speculative execution [40]), on the same
CPU core as the Meltdown attack, the attacker can leak
the content of the uncacheable pages. We suspect that
Meltdown reads the value from the line ﬁll buffers. As
the ﬁll buffers are shared between threads running on the
same core, the read to the same address within the Melt-
down attack could be served from one of the ﬁll buffers
allowing the attack to succeed. However, we leave fur-
ther investigations on this matter open for future work.

A similar observation on uncacheable memory was
also made with Spectre attacks on the System Manage-

ment Mode [10]. While the attack works on memory
set uncacheable over Memory-Type Range Registers, it
does not work on memory-mapped I/O regions, which
is the expected behavior as accesses to memory-mapped
I/O can always have architectural effects.

6.2 Meltdown Performance

To evaluate the performance of Meltdown, we leaked
known values from kernel memory. This allows us to
not only determine how fast an attacker can leak mem-
ory, but also the error rate, i.e., how many byte errors to
expect. The race condition in Meltdown (cf. Section 5.2)
has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the performance of the at-
tack, however, the race condition can always be won. If
the targeted data resides close to the core, e.g., in the
L1 data cache, the race condition is won with a high
probability. In this scenario, we achieved average read-
ing rates of up to 582 KB/s (µ = 552.4, σ = 10.2) with
an error rate as low as 0.003 % (µ = 0.009, σ = 0.014)
using exception suppression on the Core i7-8700K over
10 runs over 10 seconds. With the Core i7-6700K we
achieved 569 KB/s (µ = 515.5, σ = 5.99) with an min-
imum error rate of 0.002 % (µ = 0.003, σ = 0.001) and
491 KB/s (µ = 466.3, σ = 16.75) with a minimum error
rate of 10.7 % (µ = 11.59, σ = 0.62) on the Xeon E5-
1630. However, with a slower version with an average
reading speed of 137 KB/s, we were able to reduce the
error rate to 0. Furthermore, on the Intel Core i7-6700K
if the data resides in the L3 data cache but not in L1,
the race condition can still be won often, but the average
reading rate decreases to 12.4 KB/s with an error rate as
low as 0.02 % using exception suppression. However, if
the data is uncached, winning the race condition is more
difﬁcult and, thus, we have observed reading rates of less
than 10 B/s on most systems. Nevertheless, there are
two optimizations to improve the reading rate: First, by
simultaneously letting other threads prefetch the memory
locations [21] of and around the target value and access
the target memory location (with exception suppression
or handling). This increases the probability that the spy-
ing thread sees the secret data value in the right moment
during the data race. Second, by triggering the hardware
prefetcher through speculative accesses to memory loca-
tions of and around the target value. With these two opti-
mizations, we can improve the reading rate for uncached
data to 3.2 KB/s.

For all tests, we used Flush+Reload as a covert chan-
nel to leak the memory as described in Section 5, and In-
tel TSX to suppress the exception. An extensive evalua-
tion of exception suppression using conditional branches
was done by Kocher et al. [40] and is thus omitted in this
paper for the sake of brevity.

6.3 Limitations on ARM and AMD

We also tried to reproduce the Meltdown bug on several
ARM and AMD CPUs. While we were able to suc-
cessfully leak kernel memory with the attack described
in Section 5 on different Intel CPUs and a Samsung
Exynos M1 processor, we did not manage to mount Melt-
down on other ARM cores nor on AMD. In the case of
ARM, the only affected processor is the Cortex-A75 [17]
which has not been available and, thus, was not among
our devices under test. However, appropriate kernel
patches have already been provided [2]. Furthermore, an
altered attack of Meltdown targeting system registers in-
stead of inaccessible memory locations is applicable on
several ARM processors [17]. Meanwhile, AMD pub-
licly stated that none of their CPUs are not affected by
Meltdown due to architectural differences [1].

The major part of a microarchitecture is usually not
publicly documented. Thus, it is virtually impossible
to know the differences in the implementations that al-
low or prevent Meltdown without proprietary knowledge
and, thus, the intellectual property of the individual CPU
manufacturers. The key point is that on a microarchitec-
tural level the load to the unprivileged address and the
subsequent instructions are executed while the fault is
only handled when the faulting instruction is retired. It
can be assumed that the execution units for the load and
the TLB are designed differently on ARM, AMD and
Intel and, thus, the privileges for the load are checked
differently and occurring faults are handled differently,
e.g., issuing a load only after the permission bit in the
page table entry has been checked. However, from a
performance perspective, issuing the load in parallel or
only checking permissions while retiring an instruction
is a reasonable decision. As trying to load kernel ad-
dresses from user space is not what programs usually do
and by guaranteeing that the state does not become ar-
chitecturally visible, not squashing the load is legitimate.
However, as the state becomes visible on the microarchi-
tectural level, such implementations are vulnerable.

However, for both ARM and AMD, the toy example
as described in Section 3 works reliably, indicating that
out-of-order execution generally occurs and instructions
past illegal memory accesses are also performed.

7 Countermeasures

In this section, we discuss countermeasures against the
Meltdown attack. At ﬁrst, as the issue is rooted in the
hardware itself, we discuss possible microcode updates
and general changes in the hardware design. Second, we
discuss the KAISER countermeasure that has been de-
veloped to mitigate side-channel attacks against KASLR
which inadvertently also protects against Meltdown.

7.1 Hardware

Meltdown bypasses the hardware-enforced isolation of
security domains. There is no software vulnerabil-
ity involved in Meltdown. Any software patch (e.g.,
KAISER [20]) will leave small amounts of memory ex-
posed (cf. Section 7.2). There is no documentation
whether a ﬁx requires the development of completely
new hardware, or can be ﬁxed using a microcode update.
As Meltdown exploits out-of-order execution, a trivial
countermeasure is to disable out-of-order execution com-
pletely. However, performance impacts would be devas-
tating, as the parallelism of modern CPUs could not be
leveraged anymore. Thus, this is not a viable solution.

Meltdown is some form of race condition between the
fetch of a memory address and the corresponding per-
mission check for this address. Serializing the permis-
sion check and the register fetch can prevent Meltdown,
as the memory address is never fetched if the permission
check fails. However, this involves a signiﬁcant overhead
to every memory fetch, as the memory fetch has to stall
until the permission check is completed.

A more realistic solution would be to introduce a hard
split of user space and kernel space. This could be en-
abled optionally by modern kernels using a new hard-
split bit in a CPU control register, e.g., CR4. If the hard-
split bit is set, the kernel has to reside in the upper half
of the address space, and the user space has to reside in
the lower half of the address space. With this hard split,
a memory fetch can immediately identify whether such a
fetch of the destination would violate a security bound-
ary, as the privilege level can be directly derived from
the virtual address without any further lookups. We ex-
pect the performance impacts of such a solution to be
minimal. Furthermore, the backwards compatibility is
ensured, since the hard-split bit is not set by default and
the kernel only sets it if it supports the hard-split feature.
Note that these countermeasures only prevent Melt-
down, and not the class of Spectre attacks described by
Kocher et al. [40]. Likewise, their presented countermea-
sures [40] do not affect Meltdown. We stress that it is im-
portant to deploy countermeasures against both attacks.

7.2 KAISER

As existing hardware is not as easy to patch, there is a
need for software workarounds until new hardware can
be deployed. Gruss et al. [20] proposed KAISER, a
kernel modiﬁcation to not have the kernel mapped in
the user space. This modiﬁcation was intended to pre-
vent side-channel attacks breaking KASLR [29, 21, 37].
However, it also prevents Meltdown, as it ensures that
there is no valid mapping to kernel space or physical
In concurrent work
memory available in user space.

to KAISER, Gens et al. [14] proposed LAZARUS as a
modiﬁcation to the Linux kernel to thwart side-channel
attacks breaking KASLR by separating address spaces
similar to KAISER. As the Linux kernel continued the
development of the original KAISER patch and Win-
dows [53] and macOS [34] based their implementation
on the concept of KAISER to defeat Meltdown, we will
discuss KAISER in more depth.

Although KAISER provides basic protection against
Meltdown, it still has some limitations. Due to the design
of the x86 architecture, several privileged memory loca-
tions are still required to be mapped in user space [20],
leaving a residual attack surface for Meltdown, i.e., these
memory locations can still be read from user space. Even
though these memory locations do not contain any se-
crets, e.g., credentials, they might still contain pointers.
Leaking one pointer can sufﬁce to break KASLR, as the
randomization can be computed from the pointer value.
Still, KAISER is the best short-time solution currently
available and should therefore be deployed on all sys-
tems immediately. Even with Meltdown, KAISER can
avoid having any kernel pointers on memory locations
that are mapped in the user space which would leak in-
formation about the randomized offsets. This would re-
quire trampoline locations for every kernel pointer, i.e.,
the interrupt handler would not call into kernel code di-
rectly, but through a trampoline function. The trampo-
line function must only be mapped in the kernel. It must
be randomized with a different offset than the remaining
kernel. Consequently, an attacker can only leak pointers
to the trampoline code, but not the randomized offsets of
the remaining kernel. Such trampoline code is required
for every kernel memory that still has to be mapped in
user space and contains kernel addresses. This approach
is a trade-off between performance and security which
has to be assessed in future work.

The original KAISER patch [18] for the Linux kernel
has been improved [24, 25, 26, 27] with various opti-
mizations, e.g., support for PCIDs. Afterwards, before
merging it into the mainline kernel, it has been renamed
to kernel page-table isolation (KPTI) [49, 15]. KPTI is
active in recent releases of the Linux kernel and has been
backported to older versions as well [30, 43, 44, 42].

Microsoft implemented a similar patch inspired by
KAISER [53] named KVA Shadow [39]. While KVA
Shadow only maps a minimum of kernel
transition
code and data pages required to switch between address
spaces, it does not protect against side-channel attacks
against KASLR [39].

Apple released updates in iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2
and tvOS 11.2 to mitigate Meltdown. Similar to Linux
and Windows, macOS shared the kernel and user address
spaces in 64-bit mode unless the -no-shared-cr3 boot
option was set [46]. This option unmaps the user space

while running in kernel mode but does not unmap the
kernel while running in user mode [51]. Hence, it has
no effect on Meltdown. Consequently, Apple introduced
Double Map [34] following the principles of KAISER to
mitigate Meltdown.

8 Discussion

Meltdown fundamentally changes our perspective on the
security of hardware optimizations that manipulate the
state of microarchitectural elements. The fact that hard-
ware optimizations can change the state of microar-
chitectural elements, and thereby imperil secure soft-
ware implementations,
is known since more than 20
years [41]. Both industry and the scientiﬁc community
so far accepted this as a necessary evil for efﬁcient com-
puting. Today it is considered a bug when a crypto-
graphic algorithm is not protected against the microar-
chitectural leakage introduced by the hardware optimiza-
tions. Meltdown changes the situation entirely. Melt-
down shifts the granularity from a comparably low spa-
tial and temporal granularity, e.g., 64-bytes every few
hundred cycles for cache attacks, to an arbitrary granu-
larity, allowing an attacker to read every single bit. This
is nothing any (cryptographic) algorithm can protect it-
self against. KAISER is a short-term software ﬁx, but the
problem we have uncovered is much more signiﬁcant.

We expect several more performance optimizations in
modern CPUs which affect the microarchitectural state
in some way, not even necessarily through the cache.
Thus, hardware which is designed to provide certain se-
curity guarantees, e.g., CPUs running untrusted code, re-
quires a redesign to avoid Meltdown- and Spectre-like
attacks. Meltdown also shows that even error-free soft-
ware, which is explicitly written to thwart side-channel
attacks, is not secure if the design of the underlying hard-
ware is not taken into account.

With the integration of KAISER into all major oper-
ating systems, an important step has already been done
to prevent Meltdown. KAISER is a fundamental change
in operating system design. Instead of always mapping
everything into the address space, mapping only the min-
imally required memory locations appears to be a ﬁrst
step in reducing the attack surface. However, it might not
be enough, and even stronger isolation may be required.
In this case, we can trade ﬂexibility for performance and
security, by e.g., enforcing a certain virtual memory lay-
out for every operating system. As most modern oper-
ating systems already use a similar memory layout, this
might be a promising approach.

Meltdown also heavily affects cloud providers, espe-
cially if the guests are not fully virtualized. For per-
formance reasons, many hosting or cloud providers do
In
not have an abstraction layer for virtual memory.

such environments, which typically use containers, such
as Docker or OpenVZ, the kernel is shared among all
guests. Thus, the isolation between guests can simply be
circumvented with Meltdown, fully exposing the data of
all other guests on the same host. For these providers,
changing their infrastructure to full virtualization or us-
ing software workarounds such as KAISER would both
increase the costs signiﬁcantly.

Concurrent work has investigated the possibility to
read kernel memory via out-of-order or speculative ex-
ecution, but has not succeeded [13, 50]. We are the ﬁrst
to demonstrate that it is possible. Even if Meltdown is
ﬁxed, Spectre [40] will remain an issue, requiring differ-
ent defenses. Mitigating only one of them will leave the
security of the entire system at risk. Meltdown and Spec-
tre open a new ﬁeld of research to investigate to what ex-
tent performance optimizations change the microarchi-
tectural state, how this state can be translated into an ar-
chitectural state, and how such attacks can be prevented.

9 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented Meltdown, a novel software-
based attack exploiting out-of-order execution and side
channels on modern processors to read arbitrary ker-
nel memory from an unprivileged user space program.
Without requiring any software vulnerability and inde-
pendent of the operating system, Meltdown enables an
adversary to read sensitive data of other processes or vir-
tual machines in the cloud with up to 503 KB/s, affect-
ing millions of devices. We showed that the counter-
measure KAISER, originally proposed to protect from
side-channel attacks against KASLR, inadvertently im-
pedes Meltdown as well. We stress that KAISER needs
to be deployed on every operating system as a short-term
workaround, until Meltdown is ﬁxed in hardware, to pre-
vent large-scale exploitation of Meltdown.

Several authors of this paper found Meltdown indepen-
dently, ultimately leading to this collaboration. We want
to thank everyone who helped us in making this collabo-
ration possible, especially Intel who handled our respon-
sible disclosure professionally, comunicated a clear time-
line and connected all involved researchers. We thank
Mark Brand from Google Project Zero for contributing

A Meltdown in Practice

In this section, we show how Meltdown can be used in
practice. In Appendix A.1, we show physical memory
dumps obtained via Meltdown, including passwords of
the Firefox password manager.
In Appendix A.2, we
demonstrate a real-world exploit.

A.1 Physical-memory Dump using Melt-

down

Listing 3 shows a memory dump using Meltdown on
an Intel Core i7-6700K running Ubuntu 16.10 with the
In this example, we can identify
Linux kernel 4.8.0.
HTTP headers of a request to a web server running on
the machine. The XX cases represent bytes where the side
channel did not yield any results, i.e., no Flush+Reload
hit. Additional repetitions of the attack may still be able
to read these bytes.

Listing 4 shows a memory dump of Firefox 56 using
Meltdown on the same machine. We can clearly iden-
tify some of the passwords that are stored in the internal
password manager, i.e., Dolphin18, insta 0203, and
secretpwd0. The attack also recovered a URL which
appears to be related to a Firefox add-on.

A.2 Real-world Meltdown Exploit

In this section, we present a real-world exploit showing
the applicability of Meltdown in practice, implemented
by Pavel Boldin in collaboration with Raphael Carvalho.
The exploit dumps the memory of a speciﬁc process, pro-
vided either the process id (PID) or the process name.

First, the exploit de-randomizes the kernel address
space layout to be able to access internal kernel struc-
tures. Second, the kernel’s task list is traversed until the
victim process is found. Finally, the root of the victim’s
multilevel page table is extracted from the task structure
and traversed to dump any of the victim’s pages.

The three steps of the exploit are combined to an end-
to-end exploit which targets a speciﬁc kernel build and
a speciﬁc victim. The exploit can easily be adapted to
work on any kernel build. The only requirement is ac-
cess to either the binary or the symbol table of the kernel,
which is true for all public kernels which are distributed
as packages, i.e., not self-compiled.
In the remainder
of this section, we provide a detailed explanation of the
three steps.

A.2.1 Breaking KASLR

The ﬁrst step is to de-randomize KASLR to access in-
ternal kernel structures. The exploit locates a known
value inside the kernel, speciﬁcally the Linux banner
string, as the content is known and it is large enough to
rule out false positives. It starts looking for the banner
string at the (non-randomized) default address according
to the symbol table of the running kernel. If the string
is not found, the next attempt is made at the next pos-
sible randomized address until the target is found. As
the Linux KASLR implementation only has an entropy
of 6 bits [37], there are only 64 possible randomization
offsets, making this approach practical.

The difference between the found address and the non-
randomized base address is then the randomization offset

of the kernel address space. The remainder of this section
assumes that addresses are already de-randomized using
the detected offset.

A.2.2 Locating the Victim Process

Linux manages all processes (including their hierarchy)
in a linked list. The head of this task list is stored in the
init task structure, which is at a ﬁxed offset that only
varies among different kernel builds. Thus, knowledge
of the kernel build is sufﬁcient to locate the task list.

Among other members, each task list structure con-
tains a pointer to the next element in the task list as well
as a task’s PID, name, and the root of the multilevel page
table. Thus, the exploit traverses the task list until the
victim process is found.

A.2.3 Dumping the Victim Process

The root of the multilevel page table is extracted from
the victim’s task list entry. The page table entries on
all levels are physical page addresses. Meltdown can
read these addresses via the direct-physical map, i.e., by
adding the base address of the direct-physical map to the
physical addresses. This base address is 0xffff 8800
0000 0000 if the direct-physical map is not randomized.
If the direct-physical map is randomized, it can be ex-
tracted from the kernel’s page offset base variable.

Starting at the root of the victim’s multilevel page ta-
ble, the exploit can simply traverse the levels down to the
lowest level. For a speciﬁc address of the victim, the ex-
ploit uses the paging structures to resolve the respective
physical address and read the content of this physical ad-
dress via the direct-physical map. The exploit can also
be easily extended to enumerate all pages belonging to
the victim process, and then dump any (or all) of these
pages.

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has 19 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 42.2 kernel was updated to 4.4.104 to receive various
security and bugfixes.
This update adds mitigations for various side channel attacks against
modern CPUs that could disclose content of otherwise unreadable memory
(bnc#1068032).
- CVE-2017-5753 / "SpectreAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring deep instruction pipelining could use attacker
controllable speculative execution over code patterns in the Linux
Kernel to leak content from otherwise not readable memory in the same
address space, allowing retrieval of passwords, cryptographic keys and
other secrets.
This problem is mitigated by adding speculative fencing on affected code
paths throughout the Linux kernel.
- CVE-2017-5715 / "SpectreAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring branch prediction could use mispredicted branches to
speculatively execute code patterns that in turn could be made to leak
other non-readable content in the same address space, an attack similar
to CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by disabling predictive branches, depending
on CPU architecture either by firmware updates and/or fixes in the
user-kernel privilege boundaries.
Please also check with your CPU / Hardware vendor on updated firmware
or BIOS images regarding this issue.
As this feature can have a performance impact, it can be disabled using
the "nospec" kernel commandline option.
- CVE-2017-5754 / "MeltdownAttack": Local attackers on systems with modern
CPUs featuring deep instruction pipelining could use code patterns in
userspace to speculative executive code that would read
otherwise read protected memory, an attack similar to CVE-2017-5753.
This problem is mitigated by unmapping the Linux Kernel from the user
address space during user code execution, following a approach called
"KAISER". The terms used here are "KAISER" / "Kernel Address Isolation"
and "PTI" / "Page Table Isolation".
Note that this is only done on affected platforms.
This feature can be enabled / disabled by the "pti=[on|off|auto]" or
"nopti" commandline options.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-17806: The HMAC implementation (crypto/hmac.c) in the Linux
kernel did not validate that the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm
is unkeyed, allowing a local attacker able to use the AF\_ALG-based hash
interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_HASH) and the SHA-3 hash algorithm
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_SHA3) to cause a kernel stack buffer overflow by
executing a crafted sequence of system calls that encounter a missing
SHA-3 initialization (bnc#1073874).
- CVE-2017-17805: The Salsa20 encryption algorithm in the Linux kernel did
not correctly handle zero-length inputs, allowing a local attacker able
to use the AF\_ALG-based skcipher interface
(CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_SKCIPHER) to cause a denial of service
(uninitialized-memory free and kernel crash) or have unspecified other
impact by executing a crafted sequence of system calls that use the
blkcipher\_walk API. Both the generic implementation
(crypto/salsa20\_generic.c) and x86 implementation
(arch/x86/crypto/salsa20\_glue.c) of Salsa20 were vulnerable
(bnc#1073792).

### Bulletin Summary

NVIDIA is providing an initial security update to mitigate aspects of Google Project Zero's January 3, 2018, publication of novel information disclosure attacks that combine CPU speculative execution with known side channels.

NVIDIA believes SHIELD Tablet GPU hardware is immune to the reported security issue. SHIELD Tablet integrates an Arm (CPU) processor that may, in certain circumstances, benefit from software mitigations to reduce the risk of the exploits identified in the Google Project Zero disclosure. For more information, refer to the [Arm Security Update](https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update).

This bulletin addresses NVIDIA software updates for SHIELD Tablet to mitigate aspects of the potential Arm CPU vulnerabilities.

These potential vulnerabilities have three known variants:

* **Variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753)**: Software mitigations for the Arm CPU issue are provided with the security update included in this bulletin. NVIDIA expects to work together with its ecosystem partners as future updates are released to further strengthen mitigations for the potentially affected CPU.
* **Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715)**: Software mitigations for the Arm CPU issue are provided with the security update included in this bulletin. NVIDIA expects to work together with its ecosystem partners as future updates are released to further strengthen mitigations for the potentially affected CPU.
* **Variant 3 (CVE-2017-5754)**: NVIDIA believes that SHIELD Tablet is not vulnerable to this variant.
* **Variant 3a (CVE-2017-5754)**: Based on [Arm's Security Update](https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update), NVIDIA believes that SHIELD Tablet does not need software mitigations for this variant.

For updates and additional information, actively monitor the [NVIDIA Product Security](http://www.nvidia.com/security) page.

Corrected: 2018-02-17 18:00:01 UTC (stable/11, 11.1-STABLE)
2018-03-14 04:00:00 UTC (releng/11.1, 11.1-RELEASE-p8)
CVE Name: CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5754
Special Note: Speculative execution vulnerability mitigation is a work
in progress. This advisory addresses the most significant
issues for FreeBSD 11.1 on amd64 CPUs. We expect to update
this advisory to include 10.x for amd64 CPUs. Future FreeBSD
releases will address this issue on i386 and other CPUs.
freebsd-update will include changes on i386 as part of this
update due to common code changes shared between amd64 and
i386, however it contains no functional changes for i386 (in
particular, it does not mitigate the issue on i386).
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
Many modern processors have implementation issues that allow unprivileged
attackers to bypass user-kernel or inter-process memory access restrictions
by exploiting speculative execution and shared resources (for example,
caches).
II. Problem Description
A number of issues relating to speculative execution were found last year
and publicly announced January 3rd. Two of these, known as Meltdown and
Spectre V2, are addressed here.
CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown)
- ------------------------
This issue relies on an affected CPU speculatively executing instructions
beyond a faulting instruction. When this happens, changes to architectural
state are not committed, but observable changes may be left in micro-
architectural state (for example, cache). This may be used to infer
privileged data.
CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre V2)
- --------------------------
Spectre V2 uses branch target injection to speculatively execute kernel code
at an address under the control of an attacker.
III. Impact
An attacker may be able to read secret data from the kernel or from a
process when executing untrusted code (for example, in a web browser).
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and reboot.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility, followed
by a reboot into the new kernel:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r now
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:03/speculative\_execution-amd64-11.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:03/speculative\_execution-amd64-11.patch.asc
# gpg --verify speculative\_execution-amd64-11.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown)
- ------------------------
The mitigation is known as Page Table Isolation (PTI). PTI largely separates
kernel and user mode page tables, so that even during speculative execution
most of the kernel's data is unmapped and not accessible.
A demonstration of the Meltdown vulnerability is available at
https://github.com/dag-erling/meltdown. A positive result is definitive
(that is, the vulnerability exists with certainty). A negative result
indicates either that the CPU is not affected, or that the test is not
capable of demonstrating the issue on the CPU (and may need to be modified).
A patched kernel will automatically enable PTI on Intel CPUs. The status can
be checked via the vm.pmap.pti sysctl:
# sysctl vm.pmap.pti
vm.pmap.pti: 1
The default setting can be overridden by setting the loader tunable
vm.pmap.pti to 1 or 0 in /boot/loader.conf. This setting takes effect only
at boot.
PTI introduces a performance regression. The observed performance loss is
significant in microbenchmarks of system call overhead, but is much smaller
for many real workloads.
CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre V2)
- --------------------------
There are two common mitigations for Spectre V2. This patch includes a
mitigation using Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation, a feature available
via a microcode update from processor manufacturers. The alternate
mitigation, Retpoline, is a feature available in newer compilers. The
feasibility of applying Retpoline to stable branches and/or releases is under
investigation.
The patch includes the IBRS mitigation for Spectre V2. To use the mitigation
the system must have an updated microcode; with older microcode a patched
kernel will function without the mitigation.
IBRS can be disabled via the hw.ibrs\_disable sysctl (and tunable), and the
status can be checked via the hw.ibrs\_active sysctl. IBRS may be enabled or
disabled at runtime. Additional detail on microcode updates will follow.
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/11/ r329462
releng/11.1/ r330908
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

# Mitigations landing for new class of timing attack

Luke Wagner
January 3, 2018

Several recently-published [research](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf) [articles](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html) have demonstrated a new class of timing attacks (Meltdown and Spectre) that work on modern CPUs.  Our internal experiments confirm that it is possible to use similar techniques from Web content to read private information between different origins.  The full extent of this class of attack is still under investigation and we are working with security researchers and other browser vendors to fully understand the threat and fixes.  Since this new class of attacks involves measuring precise time intervals, as a partial, short-term, mitigation we are disabling or reducing the precision of several time sources in Firefox.  This includes both explicit sources, like `performance.now()`, and implicit sources that allow building high-resolution timers, viz., `SharedArrayBuffer`.

Specifically, in all release channels, starting with 57:

* The resolution of `performance.now()` will be reduced to 20µs. (UPDATE: see the [MDN documentation for performance.now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now) for up-to-date precision information.)
* The `SharedArrayBuffer` feature is being disabled by default.

Furthermore, other [timing sources and time-fuzzing techniques](https://gruss.cc/files/fantastictimers.pdf) are being worked on.

In the longer term, we have started experimenting with techniques to remove the information leak closer to the source, instead of just hiding the leak by disabling timers.  This project requires time to understand, implement and test, but might allow us to consider reenabling `SharedArrayBuffer` and the other high-resolution timers as these features provide important capabilities to the Web platform.

**Update [January 4, 2018]:** We have released the [two timing-related mitigations](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-01/) described above with Firefox 57.0.4, Beta and Developers Edition 58.0b14, and Nightly 59.0a1 dated “2018-01-04” and later. Firefox 52 ESR does not support `SharedArrayBuffer` and is less at risk; the `performance.now()` mitigations will be included in the regularly scheduled Firefox 52.6 ESR release on January 23, 2018.

#### Summary

Critical vulnerabilities within several CPUs have been identified by security researchers. These hardware vulnerabilities allow programs to learn about the contents of a system's memory, using side-channel attacks. Potential attack vectors against these vulnerabilities have been published and dubbed Meltdown and Spectre. While programs are typically not permitted to read data from the OS kernel or from other programs, a malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to get hold of secrets stored in kernel memory or the memory of other programs executed on the same CPU. As a consequence, an exploit could allow attackers to get access to any sensitive data, including passwords or cryptographic keys.

#### Impact

Pepperl+Fuchs analysed their HMI products in respect of the Meltdown and Spectre attacks. To the vendor's current knowledge, their VisuNet and Box Thin Client HMI devices, based on an Intel® CPU, are potentially affected by these vulnerabilities.

In order to exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary code on the CPU of the target system.

Since Pepperl+Fuchs HMI devices are designed and intended to be used in Industrial Control System networks, typically these devices are segregated from enterprise networks and do not have direct internet access. Additionally, VisuNet HMI devices use a kiosk mode for normal operation. Within this mode access policies of thin client based VisuNet Remote Monitors and Box Thin Clients are restricted, such that users can only access predefined servers. This implies that outgoing connections and local software installations have to be configured by administrators. Hence, operators are restricted in a way such that they can only use the system as configured by administrators. If these steps are taken, this greatly reduces the risk of unwittingly accessing malicious content and executing unknown code, e.g. by accessing a website that was prepared by an attacker.

However, if a malicious website is accessed, the attacker could gain knowledge of all data in the memory of the HMI device, including passwords.

#### Solution

Pepperl+Fuchs recommend users of their HMI devices of the VisuNet RM\*, VisuNet PC\* or Box Thin Client BTC\* product families should follow these guidelines:

Pepperl+Fuchs HMI devices should be segregated from enterprise networks and the Internet.
Preconfigured server connections / websites should be restricted to secured and trusted servers. The use of secure protocols, e.g. HTTPS, is recommended.
In case websites are configured in kiosk mode, it should be ensured that whitelisted websites do not redirect to untrusted servers / websites.
For VisuNet RM\* and Box Thin Client with Shell 4.x, update 18-33537, which includes Windows security updates published by Microsoft, is available on the Pepperl+Fuchs website.
For VisuNet PC\* systems with Microsoft Windows operating systems, Microsoft offers security updates, which can be downloaded from the Microsoft website.
Please note that the Microsoft security updates directly affect machine code execution on the CPU. Users should be aware that installing these patches might negatively affect system performance and/or system stability.

This advisory will be updated as further details and/or software updates become available.

This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 17.10 for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

([CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly check the relationship between pointer

values and the BPF stack. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17863](/security/CVE-2017-17863))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16995](/security/CVE-2017-16995))

Alexei Starovoitov discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)

implementation in the Linux kernel contained a branch-pruning logic issue

around unreachable code. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service. ([CVE-2017-17862](/security/CVE-2017-17862))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel mishandled pointer data values in some situations. A

local attacker could use this to to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2017-17864](/security/CVE-2017-17864))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1005-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1005.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1005.7)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1006-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.13.0-1006.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.13.0-1006.9)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1015-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem)
  -
  [4.13.0-1015.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem/4.13.0-1015.16)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-26-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-26-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-26-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Is CPU microcode available to address CVE-2017-5715 via the microcode\_ctl package?

Updated 2018-10-05T18:43:40+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

Microcode/firmware/millicode is software that microprocessor manufacturers supply to operating system vendors to take advantage of internal features of the CPU. The authoritative source for this software is the CPU manufacturer.

The `microcode_ctl` mechanism to update system firmware is non-persistent in nature. The microcode is loaded during each boot operation; however, it is only applied in the event that the microcode available within `/lib/firmware/` for the installed CPU is newer than the revision loaded during the hardware initialization phase of boot. Updating the system firmware to a revision that includes updated microcode is applicable to any resident software, and is recommended as a more permanent solution.

Historically, Red Hat has provided updated microcode, developed by our microprocessor partners, as a customer convenience. Red Hat temporarily suspended this practice in January 2018 while microcode stabilized.

Red Hat is once again providing an updated Intel microcode package, `microcode_ctl`, and AMD microcode package, `linux-firmware`, to customers in order to simplify deployment processes and minimize downtime.

**Note**: RHEL7 splits the microcode into two rpms: Intel in microcode\_ctl and AMD in linux-firmware. RHEL6 and earlier releases have both Intel and AMD in the same microcode\_ctl rpm.

Red Hat will continue to update these microcode packages as necessary. Please contact your hardware vendor to determine whether more recent BIOS/firmware updates are recommended, as additional improvements may be available.

Please use the following Red Hat Customer Portal Lab App to verify systems have the necessary microprocessor firmware to address CVE-2017-5715 (variant 2).

**Note:** To check your system's CPU model:

```
egrep -e 'model|cpu family|stepping|microcode' /proc/cpuinfo | sort | uniq

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1068032](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1068032) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074562](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074562) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074578](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074578) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1074701](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074701) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075006](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075006) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1075419](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075419) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075748](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075748) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1080039](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1080039) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087084](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087084) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087939](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087939) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1089055](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1089055) [NEW], [1136865](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136865) [NEW], [1178658](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178658) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1201877](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1201877) [RESOLVED / WORKSFORME], [1209547](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1209547) [IN\_PROGRESS]

# CVE-2017-17806

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2017-17805.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2017-17807.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2017-17806 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17806)

#### Description

The HMAC implementation (crypto/hmac.c) in the Linux kernel before 4.14.8 does not validate that the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm is unkeyed, allowing a local attacker able to use the AF\_ALG-based hash interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_HASH) and the SHA-3 hash algorithm (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_SHA3) to cause a kernel stack buffer overflow by executing a crafted sequence of system calls that encounter a missing SHA-3 initialization.

# USN-3523-2: Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerabilities

10 January 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel
* [linux-oem](/security/cves?package=linux-oem) - Linux kernel for OEM processors

## Details

USN-3523-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 17.10.

This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 17.10 for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via

sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information, including kernel memory.

([CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly check the relationship between pointer

values and the BPF stack. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17863](/security/CVE-2017-17863))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16995](/security/CVE-2017-16995))

Alexei Starovoitov discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)

implementation in the Linux kernel contained a branch-pruning logic issue

around unreachable code. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service. ([CVE-2017-17862](/security/CVE-2017-17862))

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel mishandled pointer data values in some situations. A

local attacker could use this to to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2017-17864](/security/CVE-2017-17864))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1005-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1005.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1005.7)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1006-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.13.0-1006.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.13.0-1006.9)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1015-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem)
  -
  [4.13.0-1015.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem/4.13.0-1015.16)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-26-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-26-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-26-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-26.29~16.04.2)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCPU Side-Channel Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20180104-cpusidechannel  First Published: 2018 January 4 22:20 GMT  Last Updated:  2018 July 6 21:11 GMT  Version 1.31:  [Interim](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#interim)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  CVE-2017-5715 CVE-2017-5753 CVE-2017-5754     CWE-200          CVE-2017-5715 CVE-2017-5753 CVE-2017-5754     CWE-200       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180104-cpusidechannel/csaf/cisco-sa-20180104-cpusidechannel.json)   Email      Summary  * On January 3, 2018, researchers disclosed three vulnerabilities that take advantage of the implementation of speculative execution of instructions on many modern microprocessor architectures to perform side-channel information disclosure attacks. These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes or memory allocated to the operating system kernel.      The first two vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715, are collectively known as *Spectre*. The third vulnerability, CVE-2017-5754, is known as *Meltdown*. The vulnerabilities are all variants of the same attack and differ in the way that speculative execution is exploited.       To exploit any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.      A Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure that the underlying hardware, as well as operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.      Although Cisco cloud services are not directly affected by these vulnerabilities, the infrastructure on which they run may be impacted. Refer to the “Affected Products” section of this advisory for information about the impact of these vulnerabilities on Cisco cloud services.      Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.      This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180104-cpusidechannel>  Affected Products  * Cisco is investigating its product line to determine which products and cloud services may be affected by these vulnerabilities. As the investigation progresses, Cisco will update this advisory with information about affected products and services, including the Cisco bug ID for each affected product or service.         Any product or service not listed in the “Products Under Investigation” or “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable. The criteria for considering whether a product is vulnerable is explained in the “Summary” section of this advisory. Because this is an ongoing investigation, please be aware that products and services currently considered not vulnerable may subsequently be considered vulnerable as additional information becomes available.      Products Under Investigation No products are currently under active investigation to determine whether they are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

#### Summary:

This is the 2nd version of the Performance Considerations with results from testing updated kernels for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 6, based on "Retpoline" optimizations recently accepted upstream.

> [Kernel Side-Channel Attacks - CVE-2017-5754 CVE-2017-5753 CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/speculativeexecution)

The recent speculative execution CVEs address three potential attacks across a wide variety of architectures and hardware platforms, each requiring slightly different fixes. In many cases, these fixes also require microcode updates from the hardware vendors. Red Hat has delivered updated Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernels that focus on securing customer deployments. The nature of these vulnerabilities and their fixes introduces the possibility of reduced performance on patched systems. The performance impact depends on the hardware and the applications in place. We are actively working with our technology partners to reduce or eliminate these performance impacts as quickly as possible.

#### Details:

The Red Hat Performance Engineering team characterized application workloads to help guide partners and customers on the potential impact of the fixes supplied to correct CVE-2017-5754, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5715, including "Retpoline" kernels to secure pre-Skylake class machines to mitigate part of the Spectre vulnerability for `ibrs`. These machines still need OEM microcode to mitigate `ibpb` part of Spectre, which has little to no impact on performance. The performance impact of these patches still has considerable variations based on workload under test and the hardware configuration. Measurements are reported based on Industry Standard Benchmarks (ISB) representing a set of workloads that most closely mirror common customer deployments.

Red Hat has tested complete solutions, including updated kernels and updated microcode, on variants of the following modern high volume Intel systems: Haswell / Broadwell (not including Skylake in this report). In each instance, there is performance impact caused by the additional overhead required for security hardening in user-to kernel and kernel-to-user transitions. The impact varies with workload and hardware implementation and configuration. As is typical with performance, the impact that we measured ranged in Jan 2018 was between **1-20%** and has now improved to be within **1-8%** for the ISB set of application workloads tested.

In order to provide more detail, Red Hat’s performance team is sharing performance results measured on RHEL7, (with similar behavior on RHEL6/5), for a wide variety of benchmarks based on performance impact:

* **Measurable: previously 8-19% - updated w/ retpoline to be 4-8% -** Highly cached random memory, with buffered I/O, OLTP database workloads, HPC (High Performance Computing) scale-out environments using MPI and benchmarks with high kernel-to-user space transitions were measured to be impacted the most. Examples include OLTP Workloads (tpc), sysbench, pgbench.
* **Modest: previously 3-7% - updated w/ retpoline to be 2-5% -** Database analytics, Decision Support System (DSS), and Java VMs were measured to be impacted less than the “Measurable” category. These applications may have a significant sequential disk or network traffic, but kernel/device drivers are able to aggregate requests to moderate level of kernel-to-user transitions. Examples include SPECjbb2005, Queries/Hour and overall analytic timing (sec).
* **Small: previously 2-5% - updated w/ retpoline to be 1-2% -** Computation loads like HPC (High Performance Computing) in scale-up using OpenMP, CPU-intensive workloads that spend little time in the kernel were measured to have a very small performance penalty. Examples include Linpack NxN on x86 and SPECcpu2006.
* **Minimal:** Linux accelerator technologies that generally bypass the kernel in favor of user direct access were measured to have the least performance impact with less than 1% overhead measured. Examples tested include DPDK (VsPERF at 64 byte) and OpenOnload (STAC-N), Mellanox RDMA. Userspace accesses to VDSO, like gettimeofday (64-bit) were not impacted.
* **NOTE:** Because microbenchmarks like netperf/uperf, iozone, and fio are designed to stress a specific hardware component or operation, their results may not be generally representative of customer workload. Some microbenchmarks have shown a larger performance impacts.

Because containers are implemented as generic Linux processes, applications deployed in containers incur the same performance impact as those deployed on bare metal. We expect the impact on applications deployed in virtual guests to be higher than bare metal because of the increased frequency of user-to-kernel transitions.

The actual performance impact that customers see may vary considerably based on the nature of their workload, hardware/devices, and system constraints such as whether the workloads are CPU bound or memory bound. If an application is running on a system that has consumed the full capacity of memory and CPU, the overhead of this fix may max out the configuration, resulting in more significant performance degradation. Consequently, the only deterministic way to characterize the impact is to run your workloads in your environment.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux settings for these patches default to maximum security. Recognizing, however, that customers' needs vary, these patches may be enabled or disabled at boot time or at runtime. As a diagnostic approach, some customers may want to measure results on the patched kernel in configurations with and without the CVE patches enabled. In order to facilitate this, the kernel team has added dynamic tunables to enable/disable most of the CVE microcode/security patches through debugfs tunables as described below.

> [Controlling the Performance Impact of Microcode and Security Patches for CVE-2017-5754 CVE-2017-5715 and CVE-2017-5753 using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Tunables](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3311301)

Red Hat continues to look for ways to minimize the performance impact of these security mitigations in future versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. We fully expect that hardware vendors will prevent these vulnerabilities in new implementations of silicon/microcode. Meanwhile, Red Hat continues to focus on improving customer application performance by better characterizing relevant workloads and isolating factors that affect performance. As always, our experts will be available for consultation about the specifics of your applications and environments.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3540-1 addressed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the

Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative

execution and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory

reads via sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information,

including kernel memory. This update provides mitigations for the

i386 ([CVE-2017-5753](/security/CVE-2017-5753) only), amd64, ppc64el, and s390x architectures.

architecture in the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding

mitigations for the ppc64el architecture. Original advisory details:

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre Variant 2)

requires corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the IBRS and IBPB features are required to enable the

kernel mitigations. Ubuntu is working with Intel and AMD to provide

future microcode updates that implement IBRS and IBPB as they are made

available. Ubuntu users with a processor from a different vendor should

contact the vendor to identify necessary firmware updates. Ubuntu

will provide corresponding QEMU updates in the future for users of

self-hosted virtual environments in coordination with upstream QEMU.

Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact the cloud provider

to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new

CPU features to virtual machines.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to

apply the necessary changes.

SUMMARY

Important

01/03/2018

01/03/2018

CVE-2017-5754

Today a team of security researchers disclosed several software analysis methods that, when used for
malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from many types of computing
devices with many different vendors’ processors and operating systems.

Intel is committed to product and customer security and to responsible disclosure. We worked closely
with many other technology companies, including AMD, ARM Holdings and several operating system
vendors, to develop an industry-wide approach to mitigate this issue promptly and constructively.

For facts about these new exploits, and steps you can take to help protect your systems and information
please visit: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/facts-about-side-
channel-analysis-and-intel-products.html.

DESCRIPTION

Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch prediction may allow
unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis of
the data cache.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Most modern operating systems are impacted. Intel recommends checking with your Operating System
Vendor(s) for updates or patches.

AMD and ARM, Intel has worked with operating system vendors, equipment manufacturers, and other
ecosystem partners to develop software updates that can help protect systems from these methods. End
users and systems administrators should check with their operating system vendors and apply any
available updates as soon as practical.

## Side-Channel Analysis Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: 18-0001

Publish Date: 2018-01-08

Last Updated: 2018-07-17

Revision: 3.0

**Summary**

On January 3rd, 2018, researchers disclosed three vulnerabilities that leverage speculative
execution capabilities of many modern processors. These vulnerabilities may allow unauthorized disclosure of
information between different user processors and between user and kernel processes.

The vulnerabilities are referred to as Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754), that
differ in the specific type of speculative execution exploited.

To successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, the attack vector requires malicious code executing on the same
processor. Many Mitel products do not support installing custom software and are not directly vulnerable when
running on dedicated systems. When running as a virtual machine in a shared hosting environment, Mitel products may
be impacted by malicious code on the host.

Speculative execution is a capability to improve the performance of processors. As such, security updates to
mitigate these vulnerabilities are expected to have performance penalties, the extent depending on the specific
processor, operating system and application workload. Early results indicate performance benchmark testing, designed
to stress specific processor components, may see negative performance impacts of 10 - 30%. These results are
generally not representative of typical application workloads where various system bottlenecks constrain
performance. The performance penalty is not expected to have a significant impact for most Mitel systems which
operate well within their performance limits. Mitel is continuing to investigate performance impacts and will
provide further information as available.

Security updates are being released by processor, operating system and virtualization providers. Early guidance
indicates that server updates support tuneable configuration to allow a trade-off between security and performance.
Customers concerned about performance impacts are encouraged to review the available guidance and to assess the
trade off between security exposure and performance impacts as applied to their own deployment environment.

Mitel recommends customers apply all available security updates as they become available. For Mitel products which
include the underlying operating system, Mitel will be providing product updates.

Mitel is not aware of any active exploits of these vulnerabilities.

Mitel continues to investigate these vulnerabilities and information may change as the investigation continues. This
advisory will be updated as information is available.

advisory will be updated with additional information as it becomes available.

If you do not see your product listed above, please contact Mitel Product Support.

**Risk Assessment**

The risk of this vulnerability is rated as moderate to low for Mitel products.

Successful exploit requires an attacker to execute malicious code with user privileges, requiring an account with
privileges to install code or a separate system compromise. Exploit of these vulnerabilities may expose confidential
information but is not expected to directly impact the integrity or availability of the system.

Web browsers provide a vector for local code execution, such as JavaScript embedded in web pages. Such execution is
normally contained by the browser but these vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited by this vector. Browser
security updates have been or will soon be released for most common browsers.

Proof of concept code is publicly available. Mitel is not aware of active exploits.

**Mitigation / Recommended Action**Customers are advised to follow good security practices including using caution when browsing to unknown
and potentially malicious web sites. Specifically, customers are advised to avoid browsing to unknown sites on
servers hosting Mitel products.

For software not provided by Mitel, Mitel recommends customers apply available security updates as they become
available. Customers are advised to ensure operating system updates, including Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android, are
applied to hosts and devices running Mitel software. Several vendors are providing guidance on potential performance
impacts related to their security updates. Customers concerned about performance impacts are encouraged to review
this vendor guidance.

Mitel continues to monitor for component updates and will be providing product updates. This advisory will be
updated when Mitel product security updates are released.

There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. Note: CVE-2017-5754 affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors. AMD x86-64 microprocessors are not affected by this issue. | | | Clone Of: | [CVE-2017-5715](show_bug.cgi?id=1519780 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-5715 hw: cpu: speculative execution branch target injection") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-05-28 13:59:15 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c0)  Petr Matousek    2017-12-01 13:01:16 UTC  ``` An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.  Variant [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5754) relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.  Note: [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5754) affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors. AMD x86-64 microprocessors are not affected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c4)  Petr Matousek    2018-01-03 19:35:33 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Google Project Zero   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c7)  Petr Matousek    2018-01-03 22:54:43 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1530826](show_bug.cgi?id=1530826 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-5754 kernel: hw: cpu: speculative execution permission faults handling [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-03 23:18:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:0010 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0010](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0010)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 00:05:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:0009 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0009](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0009)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 00:19:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:0011 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0011](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0011)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 00:43:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:0007 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0007](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0007)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 00:46:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:0008 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0008](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0008)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 05:51:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:0016 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0016](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0016)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 05:53:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:0017 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0017](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0017)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 13:08:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:0018 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0018](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0018)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 16:55:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:0020 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0020](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0020)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 16:57:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2018:0021 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0021](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0021)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-04 17:08:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:0022 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0022](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0022)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c20)  Justin M.

Statement:  Please see the Vulnerability Response article for the full list of updates available and a detailed discussion of this issue.  Meltdown patches for 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ------------------------------------------------------  Red Hat has no current plans to provide mitigations for the Meltdown vulnerability in 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environments.  Following many hours of engineering investigation and analysis, Red Hat has determined that introducing changes to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment would destabilize customer deployments and violate our  application binary interface (ABI) and kernel ABI commitments to customers who rely on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to be absolutely stable.  Although Red Hat has delivered patches to mitigate the Meltdown vulnerability in other supported product offerings, the 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment presents unique challenges.  The combination of limited address space in 32-bit environments plus the mechanism for passing control from the userspace to kernel and limitations on the stack during this transfer make the projected changes too invasive and disruptive for deployments that require the highest level of system stability.  By contrast, 32-bit Meltdown mitigations have been delivered for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, where the changes are far less invasive and risky.   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c53)  Doran Moppert    2020-03-27 02:43:08 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html> <https://spectreattack.com/> <https://meltdownattack.com>   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative

execution and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory

reads via sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information,

including kernel memory. This update provides mitigations for the

i386 ([CVE-2017-5753](/security/CVE-2017-5753) only), amd64, ppc64el, and s390x architectures.

([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715), [CVE-2017-5753](/security/CVE-2017-5753))

USN-3523-1 mitigated [CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754) (Meltdown) for the amd64

architecture in Ubuntu 17.10. This update provides the corresponding

mitigations for the ppc64el architecture. Original advisory details:

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative

execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory

reads via sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including

kernel memory. ([CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-31-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-31.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-31.34)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-31-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-31.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-31.34)
* [linux-image-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.31.33](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-31.34)
* [linux-image-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.31.33](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-31.34)

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre Variant 2)

requires corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the IBRS and IBPB features are required to enable the

kernel mitigations. Ubuntu is working with Intel and AMD to provide

future microcode updates that implement IBRS and IBPB as they are made

available. Ubuntu users with a processor from a different vendor should

contact the vendor to identify necessary firmware updates. Ubuntu

will provide corresponding QEMU updates in the future for users of

self-hosted virtual environments in coordination with upstream QEMU.

Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact the cloud provider

to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new

CPU features to virtual machines.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to

apply the necessary changes.

# Android Security Bulletin—April 2018

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published April 2, 2018 | Updated April 4, 2018*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2018-04-05 or later address
all of these issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check and update
your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705).

Android partners are notified of all issues at least a month before publication.
Source code patches for these issues have been released to the Android Open
Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin
also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in Media
framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to
execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google Play Protect mitigations](#mitigations)
section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and Google Play Protect, which improve the security of the Android platform.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air update (OTA) and
firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[April 2018
Pixel / Nexus Security Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2018-04-01).

## Announcements

We would like to thank Qualcomm for their dedicated efforts to improve the
security of mobile devices. The 2018-04-05 SPL includes a cumulative list of
addressed security issues taken from Qualcomm’s 2014–2016 partner focused
bulletins, and is a reflection of their continued effort and commitment.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as
[Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect).
These capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities
could be successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through
  [Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect)
  and warns users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is
  especially important for users who install apps from outside of Google
  Play.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check
and update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2018-04-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2018-04-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2018-04-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2018-04-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2018-04-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2018-04-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2018-04-01 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues
  reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2018-04-05 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device/partner security bulletins, such as the Pixel / Nexus bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android devices.
Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in the device/partner
security bulletins are not required for declaring a security patch level.
Android device and chipset manufacturers are encouraged to document the presence
of other fixes on their devices through their own security websites, such as the
[Samsung](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb),
[LGE](https://lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates.html), or
[Pixel / Nexus](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel)
security bulletins.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1068032](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1068032) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074562](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074562) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074578](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074578) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1074701](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074701) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075006](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075006) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1075419](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075419) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075748](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075748) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1080039](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1080039) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087084](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087084) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087939](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087939) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1089055](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1089055) [NEW], [1136865](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136865) [NEW], [1178658](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178658) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1201877](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1201877) [RESOLVED / WORKSFORME], [1209547](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1209547) [IN\_PROGRESS]

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel
* [linux-oem](/security/cves?package=linux-oem) - Linux kernel for OEM processors

## Details

USN-3541-1 addressed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu

17.10. This update provides the corresponding updates for the

Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 17.10 for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative

execution and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory

reads via sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information,

including kernel memory. This update provides mitigations for the

i386 ([CVE-2017-5753](/security/CVE-2017-5753) only), amd64, ppc64el, and s390x architectures.

([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715), [CVE-2017-5753](/security/CVE-2017-5753))

USN-3523-2 mitigated [CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754) (Meltdown) for the amd64

architecture in the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

17.10 for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding

mitigations for the ppc64el architecture. Original advisory details:

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative

execution and indirect branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory

reads via sidechannel attacks. This flaw is known as Meltdown. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information, including

kernel memory. ([CVE-2017-5754](/security/CVE-2017-5754))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1006-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1006.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1006.8)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1007-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.13.0-1007.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.13.0-1007.10)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1017-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem)
  -
  [4.13.0-1017.18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem/4.13.0-1017.18)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-31-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-31.34~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-31.34~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-31-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-31.34~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-31.34~16.04.1)

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre Variant 2)

requires corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the IBRS and IBPB features are required to enable the

kernel mitigations. Ubuntu is working with Intel and AMD to provide

future microcode updates that implement IBRS and IBPB as they are made

available. Ubuntu users with a processor from a different vendor should

contact the vendor to identify necessary firmware updates. Ubuntu

will provide corresponding QEMU updates in the future for users of

self-hosted virtual environments in coordination with upstream QEMU.

Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact the cloud provider

to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new

CPU features to virtual machines.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to

apply the necessary changes.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

SUSE is aware of the Spectre Attack named side channel attack and will be publishing updates.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1068032](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1068032) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074562](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074562) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074578](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074578) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1074701](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074701) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074741](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074741) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074919](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074919) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075006](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075006) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1075007](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075007) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075262](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075262) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075419](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075419) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1076115](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1076115) [RESOLVED / INVALID], [1076372](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1076372) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1076606](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1076606) [NEW], [1078353](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1078353) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1080039](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1080039) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087887](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087887) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087939](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087939) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1088147](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1088147) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1089055](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1089055) [NEW], [1091815](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1091815) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1095735](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1095735) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1102517](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1102517) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1105108](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1105108) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1126516](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1126516) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [1173489](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1173489) [CONFIRMED], [1178658](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178658) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1201457](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1201457) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [1201877](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1201877) [RESOLVED / WORKSFORME], [1203236](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1203236) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

#### Impact

Microprocessors from Intel and AMD using the x86 architecture and some microprocessors using the ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS architecture may be susceptible to a group of attacks named Meltdown and Spectre. These attacks may lead to a (complete) disclosure of information in the memory of systems. Integrity and availability are not affected, but information gained using these weaknesses may be used in further attacks.

Meltdown [[CVE-2017-5754](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5754 "CVE-2017-5754")] allows reading the complete memory of the attacked system using a specifically crafted executable code.

Spectre [version 1: [CVE-2017-5753](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753 "CVE-2017-5753"), version 2: [CVE-2017-5715](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5715 "CVE-2017-5715")] allows reading the memory of other processes using a specifically crafted executable code or dynamic code as used in web browsers.

Only those systems can be affected that allow the installation/execution of custom code or load dynamic contents from foreign/untrusted sources. If only the root/administrative user can install/execute custom code, no additional risk exists, as the root/administrative user can read the information without exploiting this vulnerability. If a web browser can be used to view foreign web pages, the Spectre attack must be considered.

Systems that do not allow installation/execution of custom code are not affected.

#### Solution

On Industrial PCs and HMIs that operate with user installable or upgradable operating systems (mainly Windows) the latest version or update may be installed if required in the use case. As the update may have a performance impact, the application should be tested accordingly.

#### Reported by

Jann Horn (Google Project Zero), Werner Haas, Thomas Prescher (Cyberus Technology), Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard, Michael Schwarz (Graz University of Technology) published the Meltdown attack on <https://meltdownattack.com/>.

Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) and Paul Kocher, Daniel Genkin (University of Pennsylvania and University of Maryland), Mike Hamburg (Rambus), Moritz Lipp (Graz University of Technology), and Yuval Yarom (University of Adelaide and Data61) published the Spectre attack on <https://meltdownattack.com/>.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1068032](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1068032) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074562](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074562) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074578](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074578) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1074701](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074701) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074741](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074741) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1074919](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074919) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075006](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075006) [RESOLVED / DUPLICATE], [1075007](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075007) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075262](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075262) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1075419](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1075419) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1076115](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1076115) [RESOLVED / INVALID], [1076372](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1076372) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1076606](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1076606) [NEW], [1078353](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1078353) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1080039](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1080039) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087887](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087887) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1087939](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087939) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1088147](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1088147) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1089055](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1089055) [NEW], [1091815](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1091815) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1095735](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1095735) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1102517](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1102517) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1105108](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1105108) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1126516](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1126516) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [1173489](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1173489) [CONFIRMED], [1178658](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178658) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1201457](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1201457) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [1201877](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1201877) [RESOLVED / WORKSFORME], [1203236](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1203236) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

**Betreff: CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5754**

**Aktualisierung vom**: 05.03.2018 15:00 Uhr PST

Hierbei handelt es sich um eine Aktualisierung zu diesem Problem.

Ein aktualisierter Kernel für Amazon Linux steht in den Amazon Linux-Repositorys zur Verfügung. EC2-Instances, die ab dem 13. Januar 2018 mit der Amazon Linux-Standardkonfiguration gestartet wurden, enthalten das aktualisierte Paket. Dieses umfasst die aktuellsten, stabilen Open-Source-Sicherheitsverbesserungen von Linux zur Behandlung von CVE-2017-5715 im Kernel und baut auf der zuvor zur Behandlung von CVE-2017-5754 umgesetzten KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation) auf.Kunden müssen auf den neuesten Amazon Linux-Kernel oder AMI upgraden, damit die Probleme zwischen Prozessen von CVE-2017-5715 und Probleme zwischen Prozessen und dem Kernel von CVE-2017-5754 in ihren Instances wirksam behoben werden. Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter „[Processor Speculative Execution – Betriebssystem-Aktualisierungen](https://aws.amazon.com/speculative-execution-os-updates/)“.

Unten finden Sie unter "PV Instance-Empfehlungen" weitere Informationen zu paravirtualisierten (PV) Instances.

**Amazon EC2**

Alle Instances in der Amazon EC2-Flotte sind vor allen bekannten Problemen zwischen Instances von CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753 und CVE-2017-5754 geschützt. Bei Problemen zwischen Instances wird davon ausgegangen, dass eine nicht vertrauenswürdige Nachbar-Instance den Speicher einer anderen Instance oder des AWS Hypervisors auslesen könnte. Dieses Problem wurde für AWS Hypervisors behoben. Keine Instance kann den Speicher einer anderen Instance lesen. Auch kann keine Instance den AWS Hypervisor-Speicher lesen. Wie zuvor bereits angegeben, haben wir keine spürbaren Auswirkungen auf die Leistung der großen Mehrheit aller EC2 Workloads festgestellt.

Mit Stand vom 12. Januar 2018 haben wir die Deaktivierung der Teile des neuen Microcodes für Intel-CPUs der Plattformen in AWS abgeschlossen, bei denen eine geringe Anzahl von Abstürzen und andere unvorhergesehene Verhaltensweisen durch die Aktualisierung des Intel-Microcodes verursacht wurden. Diese Änderung verringerte die Probleme bei diesen wenigen Instances.

**Empfohlene Maßnahmen für AWS Batch, Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic MapReduce und Amazon Lightsail**

Es sind zwar alle Instances der Kunden wie oben beschrieben geschützt, wir empfehlen aber dennoch, dass die Kunden die Betriebssysteme ihrer Instances patchen, damit Probleme zwischen Prozessen oder Prozessen und dem Kernel behoben werden. Weitere Empfehlungen und Anweisungen für Amazon Linux und Amazon Linux 2, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Microsoft Windows, Red Hat, SUSE und Ubuntu finden Sie unter „[Processor Speculative Execution – Betriebssystem-Aktualisierungen](https://aws.amazon.com/speculative-execution-os-updates/)“.

**PV Instance-Empfehlungen**

Anhand laufender Forschungen und detaillierter Analysen der für dieses Problem verfügbaren Patches der Betriebssysteme haben wir ermittelt, dass der Schutz der Betriebssysteme für die Probleme zwischen Prozessen in paravirtualisierten (PV) Instances unzureichend ist. PV Instances werden zwar von AWS Hypervisors wie oben beschrieben vor Problemen zwischen Instances geschützt, wir empfehlen aber Kunden, die um die Prozessisolation in ihren PV Instances besorgt sind (z. B. in Bezig auf die Verarbeitung von nicht vertrauenswürdigen Daten, die Ausführung von nicht vertrauenswürdigem Code, das Hosten von nicht vertrauenswürdigen Benutzern), für langfristige Sicherheitsvorteile auf HVM Instance-Typen zu migrieren.

Weitere Informationen zu den Unterschieden zwischen PV und HVM (sowie die Dokumentation des Pfads für das Upgrade von Instances) finden Sie unter:

<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html>

Bitte wenden Sie sich an den [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support), wenn Sie bei einem Upgrade-Pfad für PV-Instances Unterstützung benötigen.

**Updates weiterer AWS-Services**

Die folgenden Services, bei denen das Patchen von im Namen von Kunden verwalteten EC2-Instances erforderlich war, haben alle Arbeiten jetzt abgeschlossen und es besteht kein Handlungsbedarf vonseiten der Kunden:

* Fargate
* Lambda

Sofern nicht anders angegeben besteht bei allen weiteren AWS-Services kein Handlungsbedarf vonseiten der Kunden.

**ECS-optimiertes AMI**

Wir haben die für Amazon ECS optimierte AMI-Version 2017.09.g entwickelt. Diese umfasst alle Schutzmaßnahmen in Bezug auf dieses Problem für Amazon Linux. Wir empfehlen allen Amazon ECS-Kunden das Upgrade auf diese neueste Version, die im AWS Marketplace erhältlich ist.

Kunden, die vorhandene, für ECS optimierte AMI Instances optimieren möchten, sollten den folgenden Befehl ausführen, damit sie das Aktualisierungspaket erhalten.

sudo yum update kernel

Wie bei jedem Update des Linux-Kernels ist nach Abschluss des yum-Updates standardmäßig ein Neustart erforderlich, damit die Updates wirksam werden.

Linux-Kunden, die das für ECS optimierte AMI nicht nutzen, werden empfohlen, sich für Updates und Anweisungen an den jeweiligen Betriebssystem-, Software- oder AMI-Drittanbieter zu wenden. Anweisungen zu Amazon Linux erhalten Sie im [Sicherheitszentrum für Amazon Linux AMI](https://alas.aws.amazon.com).

Wir haben die für Amazon ECS optimierte Windows AMI-Version 2018.01.10 veröffentlicht. Einzelheiten zur Anwendung von Patches auf ausgeführte Instances finden Sie unter „[Processor Speculative Execution – Betriebssystem-Aktualisierungen](https://aws.amazon.com/speculative-execution-os-updates/)“.

**Elastic Beanstalk**

Wir haben alle Linux-basierten Plattformen so aktualisiert, dass sie alle Amazon Linux-Schutzmaßnahmen für dieses Problem beinhalten. Siehe [Versionshinweise](https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/release-aws-elastic-beanstalk-linux-based-platform-security-updates-on-january-10-2018) für spezifische Plattformversionen. Kunden, die Elastic Beanstalk nutzen, empfehlen wir die Aktualisierung ihrer Umgebungen auf die neuesten verfügbaren Plattformversionen. Umgebungen mit verwalteten Aktualisierungen werden automatisch während des konfigurierten Wartungsfensters aktualisiert.

Windows-basierte Plattformen wurden auch so aktualisiert, dass alle Schutzmaßnahmen für EC2 Windows für dieses Problem eingeschlossen sind. Den Kunden wird empfohlen, Windows-basierte Elastic Beanstalk-Umgebungen auf die neueste verfügbare Plattformkonfiguration zu aktualisieren.

**ElastiCache**

Mit ElastiCache verwaltete Cache-Knoten von Kunden sind jeweils nur für die Ausführung einer Cache-Engine für einen einzigen Kunden dediziert. Sie haben keine vom Kunden aufrufbare Prozesse und die Kunden können auf der zu Grunde liegenden Instance keinen Code ausführen. Da AWS den Schutz der gesamten ElastiCache zu Grunde liegenden Infrastruktur abgeschlossen hat, sollten für den Kunden keine Probleme zwischen Prozessen und Kernel bzw. zwischen Prozessen untereinander auftreten. Für beide Cache Engines, die von ElastiCache unterstützt werden, sind zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine Probleme zwischen den Prozessen bekannt.

**EMR**

Amazon EMR startet Cluster von Amazon EC2 Instances, die auf Amazon Linux ausgeführt werden, im Namen von Kunden in deren Konto. Kunden, die um die Prozessisolierung innerhalb der Instances ihrer Amazon EMR-Cluster besorgt sind, sollten wie oben empfohlen ein Upgrade auf den neuesten Amazon Linux-Kernel durchführen. Wir haben den neuesten Amazon Linux-Kernel in die neuen Nebenversionen 5.11.1, 5.8.1, 5.5.1, und 4.9.3 integriert. Die Kunden können neue Amazon EMR-Cluster mit diesen Versionen erstellen.

Für aktuelle Amazon EMR-Versionen und dazugehörige ausgeführte Instances der Kunden empfehlen wir die Aktualisierung auf den neuesten Amazon Linux-Kernel wie oben empfohlen. Für neue Cluster können Kunden eine Bootstrap-Aktion zur Aktualisierung des Linux-Kernels verwenden und jede Instance neu starten. Für ausgeführte Cluster können Kunden das Linux-Kernel-Update rollierend für jede Instance im Cluster ausführen und diese neu starten. Bitte beachten Sie, dass sich der Neustart bestimmter Prozesse auf laufende Anwendungen im Cluster auswirken kann.

**RDS**

Die RDS verwaltete Datenbank-Instances von Kunden werden jeweils nur dafür reserviert, eine Datenbank-Engine für einen einzigen Kunden auszuführen. Diese Instances haben keine vom Kunden aufrufbare Prozesse und die Kunden können auf der zu Grunde liegenden Instance keinen Code ausführen. Da AWS den Schutz der gesamten RDS zu Grunde liegenden Infrastruktur abgeschlossen hat, sollten für die Kunden keine Probleme zwischen Prozessen und Kernel bzw. zwischen Prozessen untereinander auftreten. Für die meisten Datenbank-Engines, die von RDS unterstützt werden, sind zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine Probleme zwischen den Prozessen bekannt. Weitere für die Datenbank-Engine spezifische Informationen finden Sie unten. Sofern nicht anders angegeben, besteht vonseiten des Kunden kein Handlungsbedarf.

Für RDS for SQL Server Database Instances haben wir in den folgenden Engine-Versionen Betriebssystem- und Engine-Patches veröffentlicht, die Patches von Microsoft enthalten:

SQL Server 2017 (14.00.3015.40.v1)
 SQL Server 2016 (13.00.4466.4.v1)
 SQL Server 2014 (12.00.5571.0.v1)
 SQL Server 2012 (11.00.7462.6.v1)
 SQL Server 2008 R2 (10.50.6560.0.v1)

Die Kunden sollten die Empfehlungen zur Anwendung dieser Patches von Microsoft befolgen und diese zu einem für sie passenden Zeitpunkt anwenden:

<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073225/guidance-for-sql-server>

RDS PostgreSQL und Aurora PostgreSQL: Bei DB Instances, die in der Standardkonfiguration ausgeführt werden, besteht vonseiten der Kunden derzeit kein Handlungsbedarf. Wir bieten den Benutzern von plv8-Erweiterungen entsprechende Patches, sobald diese erhältlich sind. In der Zwischenzeit sollten Kunden, die plv8-Erweiterungen aktiviert haben (standardmäßig deaktiviert), sich überlegen, diese zu deaktivieren, und den folgenden V8-Leitfaden lesen: <https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Untrusted-code-mitigations>.

RDS for MariaDB, RDS for MySQL, Aurora MySQL und RDS for Oracle Database Instances: Vonseiten des Kunden besteht derzeit kein Handlungsbedarf.

**VMware Cloud on AWS**

Laut VMware „sind die in [VMSA-2018-0002](https://www.vmware.com/us/security/advisories/VMSA-2018-0002.html) beschriebenen Korrekturmaßnahmen seit Anfang Dezember 2017 in VMware Cloud on AWS vorhanden.“

Weitere Einzelheiten finden Sie im [VMware Security & Compliance Blog](https://blogs.vmware.com/security). Den aktuellen Status können Sie unter <https://status.vmware-services.io> einsehen.

**WorkSpaces**

Für Kunden, die die Windows 7-Oberfläche unter Windows Server 2008 R2 verwenden:

Microsoft hat neue Sicherheits-Updates für Windows Server 2008 R2 in Bezug auf dieses Problem veröffentlicht. Für eine erfolgreiche Bereitstellung dieser Aktualisierungen ist eine kompatible Antiviren-Software erforderlich, die wie im Sicherheits-Update von Microsoft angegeben auf dem Server ausgeführt wird: [https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/4072699/january-3-2018-windows-security-updates-and-antivirus-software](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4072699/january-3-2018-windows-security-updates-and-antivirus-software). WorkSpaces-Kunden müssen selbst Maßnahmen ergreifen, um diese Aktualisierungen zu erhalten. Führen Sie die folgenden Anweisungen von Microsoft aus: [https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/4072698/windows-server-guidance-to-protect-against-the-speculative-execution.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4072698/windows-server-guidance-to-protect-against-the-speculative-execution)

Für Kunden, die die Windows 10-Oberfläche unter Windows Server 2016 verwenden:

AWS hat Sicherheits-Updates auf WorkSpaces angewendet, auf denen die Windows 10-Oberfläche unter Windows Server 2016 ausgeführt wird. Windows 10 verfügt über die integrierte Antiviren-Software Windows Defender, die mit diesen Sicherheits-Updates kompatibel ist. Vonseiten der Kunden besteht kein Handlungsbedarf.

Kunden mit eigener Lizenz und geänderten Standardeinstellungen für die Aktualisierung:

Kunden, die WorkSpaces mit eigener Lizenz nutzen oder die Standardeinstellungen für die Aktualisierung in WorkSpaces geändert haben, müssen die von Microsoft bereitgestellten Sicherheits-Updates manuell anwenden. Wenn das auf Sie zutrifft, führen Sie die folgenden Anweisungen von Microsoft Security Advisory aus: [https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/de-de/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180002](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180002). Hier finden Sie Links zu Knowledge Base-Artikeln für Windows Server- und Client-Betriebssysteme, die detailliertere Informationen enthalten.

Aktualisierte WorkSpaces-Pakete werden bald mit den Sicherheitsupdates verfügbar sein. Kunden, die benutzerdefinierte Pakete erstellt haben, müssen diese Pakete selbst aktualisieren, damit sie die Sicherheits-Updates enthalten. Neue WorkSpaces, die von noch nicht aktualisierten Paketen ausgeführt werden, erhalten kurz nach dem Start Patches, sofern die Kunden die Standardeinstellung für die Aktualisierung in ihrem WorkSpace nicht geändert oder inkompatible Antiviren-Software installiert haben. In diesem Fall müssen Sie die obigen Schritte zum manuellen Anwenden der von Microsoft bereitgestellten Updates befolgen.

**WorkSpaces Application Manager (WAM)**

Wir empfehlen den Kunden, eine der folgenden Handlungsweisen zu wählen:

Option 1: Wenden Sie die Microsoft-Updates manuell auf ausgeführte Instances von WAM Packager und Validator an. Führen Sie dazu die Anweisungen von Microsoft aus: [https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/help/4072698/windows-server-guidance-to-protect-against-the-speculative-execution](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4072698/windows-server-guidance-to-protect-against-the-speculative-execution). Auf dieser Seite finden Sie weitere Anweisungen und relevante Downloads.

Option 2: Beenden Sie die vorhandenen Instances von Packager und Validator. Starten Sie die neuen Instances mithilfe unserer aktualisierten AMIs mit der Bezeichnung "Amazon WAM Admin Studio 1.5.1" und "Amazon WAM Admin Player 1.5.1".

The latest news and insights from Google on security and safety on the Internet

## [Today's CPU vulnerability: what you need to know](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/todays-cpu-vulnerability-what-you-need.html "Today's CPU vulnerability: what you need to know")

January 3, 2018

Posted by Matt Linton, Senior Security Engineer and Pat Parseghian, Technical Program Manager

*[Google Cloud, G Suite, and Chrome customers can visit the [Google Cloud blog](https://blog.google/topics/google-cloud/what-google-cloud-g-suite-and-chrome-customers-need-know-about-industry-wide-cpu-vulnerability/) for details about those products]*

*[For more technical details about this issue, please read [Project Zero's blog post](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)]*

Last year, [Google’s Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2014/07/announcing-project-zero.html) team discovered serious security flaws caused by “[speculative execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution),” a technique used by most modern processors (CPUs) to optimize performance.

The Project Zero researcher, Jann Horn, demonstrated that malicious actors could take advantage of speculative execution to read system memory that should have been inaccessible. For example, an unauthorized party may read sensitive information in the system’s memory such as passwords, encryption keys, or sensitive information open in applications. Testing also showed that an attack running on one virtual machine was able to access the physical memory of the host machine, and through that, gain read-access to the memory of a different virtual machine on the same host.

These vulnerabilities affect many CPUs, including those from AMD, ARM, and Intel, as well as the devices and operating systems running on them.

As soon as we learned of this new class of attack, our security and product development teams mobilized to defend Google’s systems and our users’ data. We have updated our systems and affected products to protect against this new type of attack. We also collaborated with hardware and software manufacturers across the industry to help protect their users and the broader web. These efforts have included collaborative analysis and the development of novel mitigations.

We are posting before an originally coordinated disclosure date of January 9, 2018 because of existing public reports and growing speculation in the press and security research community about the issue, which raises the risk of exploitation. The full Project Zero report is forthcoming (update: this has been published; see above).

**Mitigation status for Google products**

A list of affected Google products and their current status of mitigation against this attack appears [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138). As this is a new class of attack, our patch status refers to our mitigation for currently known vectors for exploiting the flaw. The issue has been mitigated in many products (or wasn’t a vulnerability in the first place). In some instances, users and customers may need to take additional steps to ensure they’re using a protected version of a product. This list and a product’s status may change as new developments warrant. In the case of new developments, we will post updates to this blog.

* All Google products not explicitly listed below require no user or customer action.
* Android

+ Devices with the [latest security update](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-01-01) are protected. Furthermore, we are unaware of any successful reproduction of this vulnerability that would allow unauthorized information disclosure on ARM-based Android devices.
+ Supported Nexus and Pixel devices with the latest security update are protected.
+ Further information is available [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#android).

* Google Apps / G Suite (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sites, etc.):

+ No additional user or customer action needed.

* Google Chrome

+ Some user or customer action needed. More information [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#chrome).

* Google Chrome OS (e.g., Chromebooks):

+ Some additional user or customer action needed. More information [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#chromeos).

* Google Cloud Platform

+ Google App Engine: No additional customer action needed.
+ Google Compute Engine: Some additional customer action needed. More information [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#gce).
+ Google Kubernetes Engine: Some additional customer action needed. More information [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#gke).
+ Google Cloud Dataflow: Some additional customer action needed. More information [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#clouddataflow).
+ Google Cloud Dataproc: Some additional customer action needed. More information [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#clouddataproc).
+ All other Google Cloud products and services: No additional action needed.

* Google Home / Chromecast:

+ No additional user action needed.

* Google Wifi/OnHub:

+ No additional user action needed.

**Multiple methods of attack**

To take advantage of this vulnerability, an attacker first must be able to run malicious code on the targeted system.

The Project Zero researchers discovered three methods (variants) of attack, which are effective under different conditions. All three attack variants can allow a process with normal user privileges to perform unauthorized reads of memory data, which may contain sensitive information such as passwords, cryptographic key material, etc.

In order to improve performance, many CPUs may choose to speculatively execute instructions based on assumptions that are considered likely to be true. During speculative execution, the processor is verifying these assumptions; if they are valid, then the execution continues. If they are invalid, then the execution is unwound, and the correct execution path can be started based on the actual conditions. It is possible for this speculative execution to have side effects which are not restored when the CPU state is unwound, and can lead to information disclosure.

There is no single fix for all three attack variants; each requires protection independently. Many vendors have patches available for one or more of these attacks.

We will continue our work to mitigate these vulnerabilities and will update both our product support page and this blog post as we release further fixes. More broadly, we appreciate the support and involvement of all the partners and Google engineers who worked tirelessly over the last few months to make our users and customers safe.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0292)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Extended Lifecycle Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

[Updated 4th September 2019]
The Problem Description text has been updated to fix a list of architectures addressed by the CVE-2017-5753 mitigation. No changes have been made to the packages.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.

Note: This issue is present in hardware and cannot be fully fixed via software update. The updated kernel packages provide software mitigation for this hardware issue at a cost of potential performance penalty. Please refer to References section for further information about this issue and the performance impact.

In this update mitigations for IBM zSeries (S390), x86, and x86-64 architectures are provided.

* Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5753, Important, S390, x86, and x86-64)
* Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715, Important, S390)
* Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5754, Important, x86-64)

Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting these issues.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited. Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. | | | Clone Of: | [CVE-2017-5753](show_bug.cgi?id=1519778 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-5753 hw: cpu: speculative execution bounds-check bypass") | | | Clones: | [CVE-2017-5754, Meltdown](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-5754 hw: cpu: speculative execution permission faults handling")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1519781)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-05-28 14:00:02 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1519780#c0)  Petr Matousek    2017-12-01 12:59:35 UTC  ``` An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.  Variant [CVE-2017-5715](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5715) triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.   ```  [Comment

microcode_ctl to microcode_ctl-2.1-22.2.el7.x86_64.  This can be mitigated by doing the following:  *   Hardware (CPU microcode) support for mitigation *   Kernel support for IBRS *   IBRS enabled for Kernel space *   IBRS enabled for User space  When I check this, it does have Hardware (CPU microcode) support for mitigation and Kernel support for IBRS.   Yet IBRS is still not enabled for kernel or user space by default.  Which means you remain vulnerable to the attack.  I validated the above through:  [root@vds-jordyzomer ~]# cat /sys/kernel/debug/x86/ibrs_enabled 0  This variable needs to be set to 2 for the patch to take effect.   ```  [Comment 84](show_bug.cgi?id=1519780#c84)  Ugo Bellavance    2018-01-09 15:48:05 UTC  ``` On my systems, I get a 1 in this file:  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/x86/ibrs_enabled 1  It passes the test found here: <https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker>  Are you running on bare metal?

The defaults for older processors are:  pti - 1 ibpb - 0 ibrs - 0   Looks like we will have to wait :)   ```  [Comment 87](show_bug.cgi?id=1519780#c87)  Klaas Demter    2018-01-09 16:27:11 UTC  ``` The microcode update microcode_ctl-2.1-22.2.el7.x86_64 only includes updates for certain cpus, what you need is a bios update by your server vendor or a microcode update for your cpu.  If the microcode/bios update is working your cpu will show show with new flags in lscpu: spec_ctrl and ibpb_support if those are in place ibpb and ibrs default to 1 on boot.
