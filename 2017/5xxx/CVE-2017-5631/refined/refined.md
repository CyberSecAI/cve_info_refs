Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2017-5631**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the KMCIS CaseAware application. Specifically, the `usr` parameter, which is part of the query string in `login.php`, is vulnerable to manipulation.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not adequately sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the response.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter. When a user accesses the crafted URL, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies/session tokens)
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL. Specifically, an attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `usr` parameter of the `login.php` script.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and distribute a malicious link. The victim needs to click on the crafted link while logged into the application for the XSS to be triggered.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `usr` in the `login.php` script.
*   The exploit example provided shows how to inject JavaScript:
    `https://caseaware.abc.com:4322/login.php?mid=0&usr=admin'><a HREF="javascript:alert('OPENBUGBOUNTY')">Click_ME<'`

**Additional Notes**
*   The vendor is identified as CaseAware (https://caseaware.com/).
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the application, according to the exploit description.
