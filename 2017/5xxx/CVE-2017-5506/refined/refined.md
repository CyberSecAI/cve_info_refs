Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a double-free memory corruption that occurs in the `magick/profile.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Double Free:** The code attempts to free the same memory region twice, which leads to memory corruption and can result in crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution. This is caused due to an overflow in a size check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unspecified Impact:** The official CVE description notes an "unspecified impact". The provided data details a crash, but it is possible that a crafted file could lead to arbitrary code execution.
-   **Denial of Service:** The double free can lead to a crash of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to process a malicious image file.
-   The attacker needs to craft a malicious image file that triggers the double-free condition.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves an overflow check to avoid the double free in `magick/profile.c`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing image profiles, specifically within the `SyncExifProfile` function.
- The vulnerability was present in ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.7.4 and 7.x before 7.0.4.4.
- Patches were made in `ImageMagick` commit `6235f1f7a9f7b0f83b197f6cd0073dbb6602d0fb`.
