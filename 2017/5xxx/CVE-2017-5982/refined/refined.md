Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-5982:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input within the Kodi web interface (Chorus). Specifically, the `image` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The primary vulnerability is LFI, where an attacker can manipulate the URL to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the provided path in the `image` parameter of the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, such as:
    - SMB credentials stored in `passwords.xml` if Kodi is connected to a NAS.
    - System files like `/etc/passwd`.
    - Other configuration and data files on the Kodi host.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Disclosure of sensitive information could potentially be used to facilitate further attacks or gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the Kodi web interface.
- **`image` URL Parameter:** The malicious input is injected into the `image` parameter of the URL.
- **Directory Traversal:**  Attackers use directory traversal sequences like `..%2f` (URL encoded) to navigate outside of the intended directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Kodi server's web interface (usually port 8080 by default).
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability exists before any authentication is needed to access the web interface.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable URL path is similar to: `http://<kodi-ip>:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F<path>`
- The attacker would replace the `<path>` section with directory traversal sequences like `..%2f` to navigate to the desired file path to be read.
- Example of vulnerable request:
  - `http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F%2e%2e%252fhome%252fosmc%252f.kodi%252fuserdata%252fpasswords.xml` (to retrieve SMB credentials)
  - `http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F%2e%2e%252fetc%252fpasswd` (to retrieve `/etc/passwd` file)
