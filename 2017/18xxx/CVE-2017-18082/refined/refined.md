- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying the name of a branch in the plan configuration page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, potentially leading to malicious actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious branch name containing JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create or rename branches in a Bamboo plan.
