## FAQ

### I cannot see the Twitter icon in the post after the plugin installation

In the WordPress admin panel go to “Plugins”, find the “BestWebSoft’s Twitter” plugin and click “Activate”.

### How can I deactivate the plugin

In the WordPress admin panel go to “Plugins”, find the “BestWebSoft’s Twitter” plugin and click “Deactivate”.

### How to adjust the Twitter icon position on the page

In WordPress admin panel, please go to “Twitter” settings page and select one of the listed positions: Before the post, After the post or display the buttons only via shortcode. Then click “Save Changes”.

### After installation and settings adjustment on the plugin settings page it is not working still

1. Please click “Save Changes”. Make sure that you got the message “Settings Saved”.
2. After saving your settings you should refresh the web page, where the Twitter icon should be placed.

### Can I control the order of the recommended accounts?

Only two accounts are displayed and by default the via user is shown first with the first related account shown afterwards.

They try to get you into expensive subscriptions. The option to buy is less obvious. Purchase limits you to one year of support and updates. They will let you continue to use the plugin after that, if you don’t mind running an outdated plugin. That’s so nice of them.
As soon as I find a comparable alternative I’m switching to it.
