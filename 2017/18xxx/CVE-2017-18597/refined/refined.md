Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of the `$_POST['tableId']` parameter before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the plugin directly uses the value of  `$_POST['tableId']` to construct a SQL query, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The plugin doesn't properly escape or sanitize user-supplied input (`tableId`) before incorporating it into an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive data from the database, including user login credentials, table data, and other information stored in the WordPress database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** With the ability to manipulate SQL queries, an attacker can potentially escalate their privileges or create new administrative accounts.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_old_table`. The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `tableId` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint (`wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_old_table`) and the vulnerable parameter (`tableId`).
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests with crafted payloads to the vulnerable endpoint.
