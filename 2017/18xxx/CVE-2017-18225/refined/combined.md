| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-08-31 01:42:49 UTC  ``` The executables installed to /usr/bin by net-im/jabberd2 are owned by the "jabber" user:    -rwxr-x---   1 jabber    jabber    9.5K 2017-08-30 21:34 jabberd   -rwxr-x---   1 jabber    jabber    192K 2017-08-30 21:34 jabberd2-c2s   -rwxr-x---   1 jabber    jabber    160K 2017-08-30 21:34 jabberd2-router   -rwxr-x---   1 jabber    jabber    180K 2017-08-30 21:34 jabberd2-s2s   -rwxr-x---   1 jabber    jabber    180K 2017-08-30 21:34 jabberd2-sm  Those are in root's PATH, and could conceivably be run as root during debugging or experimentation. If that ever happens, it's trivial for the "jabber" user to gain root; instead, those should likely all be root:root, or maybe root:jabber if you want to leave them mode 750. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Christopher Díaz Riveros (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2017-10-05 20:27:49 UTC  ``` Is this a Gentoo specific issue? it may be good to report upstream about this.  Gentoo Security Padawan ChrisADR ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-10-06 01:44:03 UTC  ``` The ebuild does,    fowners jabber:jabber /usr/bin/{jabberd,router,sm,c2s,s2s}  so I doubt it's an upstream issue. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Pacho Ramos   gentoo-dev  2017-11-09 13:27:27 UTC  ``` Either ones takes care of deeply reviewing the ebuild and init files (due to other opened bugs affecting them) or this should be treecleaned (there is also a pending security issue revbump in other bug) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-03-03 17:21:51 UTC  ``` Package was removed via <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=b50a30689fca4c60d2b4e625f341daff116e51b6>.  Added to an existing GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Christopher Díaz Riveros (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2018-03-12 11:04:46 UTC  ``` CVE-2017-18225 was assigned for this issue. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2018-03-19 01:06:56 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201803-07 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201803-07> by GLSA coordinator Christopher Diaz Riveros (chrisadr). ``` |  |
