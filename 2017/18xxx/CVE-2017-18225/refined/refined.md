- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The executables installed by the `net-im/jabberd2` package to `/usr/bin` were owned by the `jabber` user instead of `root`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect file ownership for executables in a system path. Specifically, the `jabberd`, `jabberd2-c2s`, `jabberd2-router`, `jabberd2-s2s`, and `jabberd2-sm` executables were owned by the `jabber` user and group.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If a user (e.g., root) were to inadvertently run these executables, the `jabber` user could potentially escalate privileges to root by exploiting this unexpected behavior
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with control over the `jabber` user could potentially gain root privileges by exploiting the fact that the executables are owned by that user. This would require a scenario where a privileged user executes one of these binaries directly from their path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have control over the `jabber` user. They must rely on a root or other privileged user accidentally executing the vulnerable executables.

The information in the bug report is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It provides the specific files involved, the incorrect ownership, and the specific exploit scenario.
