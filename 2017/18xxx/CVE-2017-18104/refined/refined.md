Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The JQL (Jira Query Language) filter used by the Webhooks component in Atlassian Jira does not correctly filter events related to "Comment" and "Worklog" actions. Specifically, when these events are triggered, the webhook is fired regardless of the JQL query defined for the webhook, causing information about these events to be sent to webhook subscribers even if they should be excluded based on the JQL filter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect JQL Filtering:** The core weakness is that the JQL filter is not applied correctly to "Comment" and "Worklog" related events in the Webhooks component. This means that webhooks may be triggered for actions that should have been filtered out based on the JQL query configuration.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to information disclosure, as data about comments and worklogs on issues can be inadvertently sent to external systems that subscribe to the webhooks, even if the JQL query should have restricted access to this information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers who can intercept webhook events (e.g. by controlling the webhook endpoint) can gain access to information about comments and worklogs on issues, even if they shouldn't have access according to the configured JQL filter. This can lead to sensitive project details being exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Webhook Interception:** The primary attack vector involves the attacker's ability to observe or intercept webhook events. This could be achieved if the attacker controls the destination endpoint of the webhook.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Intercept Webhook Events:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept webhook requests sent by the Jira server. This can be achieved by controlling the URL that is configured as the webhook endpoint, or by having a network position where webhook traffic can be observed.
*  **No direct interaction with Jira is needed to exploit this vulnerability:** As it is based on how webhooks work, the attacker can obtain the data by just having the capability to intercept the generated requests sent by the server where Jira is running.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects JIRA Server versions prior to 7.6.7 and from 7.7.0 before 7.11.0.
*   The issue is specific to "Comment" and "Worklog" related events. Events like creating or updating an issue are correctly filtered by the JQL query.
*   The issue has a "Medium" priority and "Major" symptom severity.
*   The vulnerability is also present in Jira Cloud, as indicated by the related issue [JRACLOUD-59980](http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-59980).
