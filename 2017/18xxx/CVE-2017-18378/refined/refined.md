Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `uploaddir` parameter in the `upgrade_handle.php` script of the Netgear ReadyNAS Surveillance application. Specifically, the value of `$_GET['uploaddir']` is not escaped before being passed to the `system()` function via the `$tmp_upload_dir` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the `system()` call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the web server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:**  The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `upgrade_handle.php` and injecting a payload into the `uploaddir` parameter.
    - Example: `http://IP/upgrade_handle.php?cmd=writeuploaddir&uploaddir=%27;sleep%205;%27`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Netgear ReadyNAS device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be triggered without any prior authentication.
