The provided content relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's NVMe-FC target driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `nvmet_fc_find_target_queue` function in `drivers/nvme/target/fc.c` did not validate if the target queue ID (`qid`) was within the expected range (`NVMET_NR_QUEUES`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation: The function directly uses the queue ID obtained from `nvmet_fc_getqueueid` without checking if it exceeds the maximum allowed number of queues. This could lead to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially provide an invalid queue ID which could lead to unexpected behavior in the system such as a crash due to an out-of-bounds memory access or denial of service

**Attack vectors:** An attacker with control over the NVMe-FC connection could provide a crafted connection ID that results in an out of bounds queue ID in `nvmet_fc_getqueueid`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to control or influence the connection ID when setting up a NVMe-FC connection.
