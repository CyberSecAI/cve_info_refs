## FAQ

### I want to collect statistic from my blog, what should I do?

Follow the next steps to enable tracking and collect statistics from your WordPress blog:

1. Sign in to your Google Analytics account. Click “Admin” in the menu bar at the top of any page.
2. In the Account column, select the account from the dropdown that you want to add the property to.
3. In the dropdown in the Property column, click Create new property.
4. Select Website.
5. Select a tracking method. Click either Universal Analytics (recommended) or Classic Analytics.
6. Enter the name of your WordPress blog.
7. Enter your website URL (for example, bestwebsoft.com).
8. Select an Industry Category.
9. Select the Reporting Time Zone.
10. Click Get Tracking ID.
11. Copy Tracking ID that looks like UA-xxxxx-y.
12. Open your WordPress admin dashboard.
13. Navigate to the Analytics -> Settings tab.
14. Past the code to the Tracking ID field.
15. Check Add tracking Code To Your Blog checkbox (if not checked).
16. Click Save Changes button.

### I don’t have Google Analytics account, can I still retrieve statistics using this plugin?

No, you can’t. This plugin allows you to retrieve statistics from Google Analytics account. It doesn’t generate its own statistics.

### How can I add tracking code?

After you have created a new web property you will get a tracking code. If you want to add tracking code to your blog you will need to copy Tracking ID that looks like UA-xxxxx-y, paste it to the Blog Tracking field and click the Enable Tracking button.

### I have added tracking code to my blog using this plugin. Now if I deactivate this plugin, will Google Analytics continue logging my blog?

No, if you deactivate plugin tracking code will be deleted from your blog.

### Can I create a new Google Analytics account or a new web property from within the admin area using this plugin?

No, you can’t. Google Analytics provides the developer with an access to the configuration data through the Management API, which is a read-only API for account and configuration data.

### What is the range of dates that is covered by the chart?

Line chart displays stats for the last year, 6 months, 3 months, 1 month, 5 days and 1 day.

### Over what period of time I can get the statistics?

You can select your desired time period in the “Time range” setting block on the plugin settings page. However, the time interval between start and finish dates should not exceed 1000 days.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

– The link to the page where the problem occurs

– The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.

– The version of your WordPress installation

– Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/)
