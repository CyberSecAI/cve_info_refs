{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `realloc_symlink` function within the `rock.c` file of the libcdio library. The vulnerability occurs because the code attempts to copy data from a source buffer without validating that the source buffer pointer is not NULL. Specifically, the `memcpy` function is used without first checking if `p_stat->rr.psz_symlink` is NULL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing a crafted ISO file to an application using the vulnerable `libcdio` library. When the library processes this malformed input, it will attempt to dereference the NULL pointer leading to a crash of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted ISO file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted ISO file to an application that utilizes the vulnerable libcdio library to process the ISO.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was found in libcdio versions prior to 1.0.0. A fix was introduced in libcdio version 1.0.0, addressing the issue by adding a NULL check before the memcpy call. The bug report indicates that the vulnerability was introduced sometime after version 0.90, and was present in version 0.94."
