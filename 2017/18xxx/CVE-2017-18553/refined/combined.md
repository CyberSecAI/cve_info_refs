## Description

The Ad Buttons plugin displays a number of graphical ads in a sidebar widget

The current version contains the following functionality:

Add new ad buttons:

By entering image URL, link URL and link text a new ad button will be created

Enable/disable individual ad buttons:

Each ad button can be enabled or disabled from the admin panel

Select how many ad buttons to display in the sidebar widget.

Displaying the ad buttons on your blog is done by randomly selecting ads from your total list of active ads. You can select how many ads are displayed on your blog.

See how many times each ad button has been displayed and clicked.

Ad performance is an important measurement, especially when your ads link to affiliate programs. The number of views, clicks and CTR (click thru rate) are displayed for each ad button. Views by search engine bots are automatically filtered from the count.

A Google AdSense 125 x 125 ad unit can be displayed by filling in your AdSense publisher ID. AdSense ad colors can be controlled right from the Ad Buttons admin panel.
