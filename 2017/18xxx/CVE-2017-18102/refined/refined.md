Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-18102

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the bundled version of the `atlassian-renderer` within Atlassian JIRA. Specifically, it arises from improper handling of nested wiki markup, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code. This occurs due to the inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input when rendering nested wiki markup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
  - Defacing web pages
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Nested Wiki Markup: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious input containing nested wiki markup. The specifics of this nested markup are not detailed in the provided text, but the vulnerability arises from its incorrect parsing and rendering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Attacker: The attacker can be remote since the attack vector is through the handling of the wiki markup.
- Input Injection: The attacker needs the ability to insert malicious wiki markup into a field that will be rendered by the vulnerable `atlassian-renderer` component, such as JIRA issue descriptions or comments.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Versions: The vulnerability affects Atlassian JIRA versions prior to 7.7.1, specifically mentioning 7.5.3 and versions going back to 7.05.
- Fix Versions: The issue was resolved in versions 7.7.1, 7.8.0, and 7.6.8.
- Severity: The issue is considered a "Severity 2 - Major," which indicates a significant impact.
