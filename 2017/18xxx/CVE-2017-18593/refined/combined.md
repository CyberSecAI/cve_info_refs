## Description

[The UpdraftPlus Backup & Migration Plugin](https://updraftplus.com) is trusted by the WordPress community to backup, restore and migrate their WordPress websites. UpdraftPlus is actively installed on more than 3 million websites around the world.

#### Backup with UpdraftPlus

UpdraftPlus is the world’s highest ranking and most popular scheduled backup and migration plugin. Backup to your preferred storage location and restore in just three clicks.

Backup to Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon S3 (or compatible), Rackspace Cloud, FTP, DreamObjects, Openstack Swift or email.

The paid version also allows you to backup to Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Backblaze B2, SFTP, SCP, pCloud, WebDAV or UpdraftVault, our integrated storage option for UpdraftPlus.

Backup manually or schedule to run every 2, 4, 8 or 12 hours, daily, weekly, monthly or fortnightly.

#### Restore with UpdraftPlus

Your WordPress website is vulnerable. Your site may get hacked. Something could go wrong with an update or your server could crash. You might need to reverse a change made or a mistake caused by human error.

Whatever the reason, you can restore your WordPress website in just a few clicks with UpdraftPlus. Choose which components to restore (e.g. plugins, themes, database etc.), click again to restore, then click again to return to the main screen.

#### Migrate with UpdraftPlus

It’s easy to migrate your WordPress website to another web host, server or domain with this free version of UpdraftPlus.

To migrate, simply download your database, plugins, themes etc. from the source site, then upload them into your destination site.

When migrating, a built-in search-and-replace engine identifies old strings and replaces these to reflect the new location. UpdraftPlus saves you time and reduces the risk of broken links or missing files associated with manual migrations.

#### Why UpdraftPlus?

Writing a reliable backup and migration plugin that ‘just works’ consistently across millions of different WordPress deployments is hard. UpdraftPlus is relied upon to do exactly that. We’re trusted and actively deployed on more websites around the world than any other WordPress backup and migration plugin.

UpdraftPlus:

* Backs up, migrates and restores
* Offers a huge number of remote storage locations
* Allows you to schedule backups, so you can ‘set and forget’
* Is comprehensive and easy to use
* Is proven to work on over 3 million sites.

#### UpdraftPlus Premium

The free version of UpdraftPlus will back up and migrate your website perfectly well. However if you need more features and options you can purchase our Premium version.

Backup and Migrate with UpdraftPlus Premium, and:

* Get automatic backups before updates. Restore the very latest version if a WordPress or plugin update breaks your site.
* Backup Incrementally. Changes are added to the master, saving server resources vs repeatedly backing up in full.

  Restore from other backup plugins including BackWPup, BackupWordPress, Simple Backups and more.
* Run backups at set times e.g. during periods of low traffic.
* Backup to more than one location for added protection.
* Get detailed reports. Includes cryptographic checksums so you can verify the integrity of the backup files and more.
* Get Premium migration. Migrating to the destination site is more direct and can be done from the source site.
* Get Multisite / multi-network compatibility.
* Backup non-WP files and databases e.g. tables belonging to your e-commerce store or customisations to WordPress core.
* Get database encryption.
* Manage your backups and migrations from the WP-CLI.
* Get Premium Support.

#### Managing multiple websites?

UpdraftCentral is a powerful remote control dashboard for WordPress that allows you to manage your backups, as well as updates, users, pages, posts, plugins and themes from one central location. Choose between:

* [UpdraftCentral](https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftcentral/#description/) (free, self-hosted)
* [UpdraftCentral Premium](https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftcentral-premium/) (paid-for, self-hosted)
* [UpdraftCentral Cloud](https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftcentral-dashboard/) (paid-for, fully-hosted)

Optimize your sites centrally by combining the power of WP-Optimize and UpdraftCentral or manage your backups centrally by combining the power of UpdraftPlus with UpdraftCentral.

#### Need to create a temporary clone of your site?

UpdraftClone makes it quick and easy to create a temporary sandbox for changes you want to try out. Simply select the versions of WordPress and PHP that you want, and we’ll do the rest. [More about UpdraftClone](https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftclone-tokens/)

The UpdraftPlus backup, migration and restoration plugin is ready and waiting. The translation process is easy, and web-based – please go here for instructions: https://updraftplus.com/translate/.

Or, if you’re already an expert WordPress translator, just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory – if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: \_x(), \_\_(), \_e(), \_ex(), log\_e().

Many thanks to our existing translators.

## FAQ

### How do I install the UpdraftPlus backup & migration plugin?

Here are the installation guidelines from our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ReY7Z19h2I) or from [our website](https://updraftplus.com/download/).

### What if I have a problem / need support ?

If you’re struggling to backup, migrate or restore there’s help available.

Search existing topics on the WordPress support forum or post a new one. Our support and development teams check and respond to queries everyday.

UpdraftPlus Premium customers can log a ticket directly with our support and development teams via the [UpdraftPlus support hub](https://updraftplus.com/support/).

Before you get in touch, please ensure that you have read through our <a href=https://updraftplus.com/frequently-asked-questions/”>FAQs and that you’ve updated to the latest release of our plugin.

It helps greatly if you can include the backup log and as much other information as possible in your report, for example the PHP version, your website, the error description, how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, plus any other information that might be of use.

To find the backup log: there are links to download the logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page in the plugin – or you may be emailed it. Failing that, FTP into the directory wp-content/updraft and look for it there.

If you know how, please send your PHP error logs – just the few lines that appear when you run a backup, often the file called error\_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory which you can check via FTP. If you’re a programmer that can debug and send a patch, that’s even better.

### When it comes to migration, what does the premium plugin do that the free plugin can’t?

Migrating in the free plugin involves downloading the backups from the source site then uploading these to the destination site.

To find the backup log: there are links to download the logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page- or you may be emailed it. Failing that, FTP into the directory wp-content/updraft and look for it there.

Both free and Premium plugins include a built-in search-and-replace engine to replace old strings with the new location.

If migration is all you require, and for simple single site migrations the free plugin will likely be enough to meet your needs. If you have additional needs around backups e.g. the ability to backup before updates, if you require more remote storage locations or if you have a WordPress multisite then we recommend UpdraftPlus Premium for the additional benefits that it brings.

### UpdraftPlus runs out of time when it’s trying to backup, after I have left it for some time to give it a good chance. What can I do?

This problem is probably caused by your account being starved of resources by your (cheap) web host provider. This is far from ideal; although UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning to avoid everything having to be done at once, it has its limits. The best thing is to choose a more reputable web host. Failing this, try going into the “Expert settings” and reducing the size at which zip files are split. UpdraftPlus is known to successfully backup websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.

I chose updraft in the 2010’s as I began my blog in 2008 while in Austin. It has always been dependable through several years of extreme life difficulty. I still choose it. I can afford it as I am beginning anew in Denver in the beautiful state of Colorado.
Thank you for being there and getting the backup job done with ease.

## Changelog

The [UpdraftPlus backup blog](https://updraftplus.com/news/) is the best place to learn in more detail about any important changes.

N.B. Paid versions of UpdraftPlus Backup / Restore have a version number which is 1 higher in the first digit, and has an extra component on the end, but the changelog below still applies. i.e. changes listed for 1.16.32.x of the free version correspond to changes made in 2.16.32.x of the paid version.

= 1.25.1 – 11/Jan/2025

* SECURITY: Fix a non-persistent reflected XSS vulnerability due to a missing nonce combined with missing sanitisation. This could allow an attacker, who persuaded you to click a personally-crafted link to your site’s dashboard whilst you were logged in, to once run JavaScript code in your dashboard. Thanks to Asaf Mozes for finding and responsibly disclosing this issue.
* FIX: Prevent the restoration from failing when there is a ‘sync-xhr=()’ permission policy on the response header.
* FIX: Improve the approach of acquiring a suggested region for Amazon AWS S3 if a failure arises during the getBucketLocation() call, particularly when the XML response fails to provide a field for the suggested region – this resolves issues with regions (e.g. us-east-2) which recently changed their response behaviour
* TWEAK: Broaden the support to incorporate the “ap-southeast-4” region of Amazon AWS S3 and additional recently updated regions
* TWEAK: A regression in the paid version update checker to version 4.13.2, resulting in non-appearance of notices concerning subscription status or WP version compatibility.

#### 1.24.12 – 23/Dec/2024

* FIX: The pre-restoration stage failed to properly address the tables that were to be excluded, which caused a logical error that misread the checked “include all tables not listed” option as an instruction to restore every table
* FIX: Update PHPSecLib library to version 2.0.48 which has the fixes for the “gmp\_pow(): base and exponent overflow” on certain PHP versions and could cause backups to fail on the SFTP remote storage
* TWEAK: Complete the review and removal of calls to the unserialize() PHP function allowing class instantiation begun in 1.24.7. (The final removal involved a theoretical security defect, if your development site allowed an attacker to post content to it which you migrated to another site, and which contained customised code that could perform destructive actions which the attacker knew about, prior to you then cloning the site. The result of this removal is that some search-replaces, highly unlikely to be encountered in practice, will be skipped).
* TWEAK: Drop search and replace feature for PHP 5.2 users (to fulfil the preceding item)
* TWEAK: Tweak UpdraftCentral media module to add “has\_image\_editor” property to each media item
* TWEAK: On the restoration screen in a multisite configuration, the dropdown labeled “which site to restore” was covering other HTML elements, which caused some buttons to be positioned at the bottom instead of at the top
* TWEAK: Avoid deregistering jQuery-UI CSS if already printed by other plugins to prevent compatibility issues
* TWEAK: In the context of database restoration, the execution of LOCK and/or ALTER SQL statements must be avoided for any tables that are part of the “skipped tables” list
* TWEAK: openssl\_free\_key() is only needed on PHP < 8
* TWEAK: Various coding style changes to comply with “Plugin Check” rules

#### 1.24.11 – 15/Nov/2024

* TWEAK: Do not request drive.readonly scope on Google Drive connections, due to Google’s app permissions review (unannounced and requires us to create a Youtube video for their review process) – this means that (until the review completes) new connections to Google Drive can only access backups created by UpdraftPlus directly, and not backups which you manually upload to Google Drive. This restores the ability to make new connections to Google Drive.
* TWEAK: Adjustment of the UpdraftPlus\_S3\_Compat class to preserve compatibility with the external UpdraftPlus AWS SDK plugin (https://github.com/DavidAnderson684/updraftplus-aws-sdk).

#### 1.24.9 – 14/Nov/2024

* FIX: A regression in 1.24.8 when handling restoration of wp-config.php
* TWEAK: The changes in handling of loading text domains in 1.24.8 did not cover most cases
* TWEAK: Introduce the “updraftplus\_use\_builtin\_wpcore\_restoration” filter which can be used to restore WP-Core entity using a different WP-Core restoration mechanism especially in a case that the admin-ajax.php file couldn’t be deleted during the restoration

#### 1.24.8 – 13/Nov/2024

* TWEAK: Add descriptions for the ‘Clone Package’ dropdown when creating a clone.
* TWEAK: Move the “load\_plugin\_textdomain” call from being called through “plugins\_loaded” action to being called via “init” action
* TWEAK: Update the log message to specify that backup files are marked as “processed” when no remote storage is selected, and as “uploaded” when remote storage is selected.
* TWEAK: Some code tidying in the restore class

#### 1.24.7 – 04/Nov/2024

* TWEAK: Include the .part file extension into the cleanup list, guaranteeing that files associated with this extension are regularly deleted from the backup directory
* TWEAK: The update functionalities in the WordPress plugin information box (6.5 and later) have been adjusted to stop updates from taking place in the same window, ensuring that the “auto-backup before update” dialog appears as intended
* TWEAK: Add customized “unserialized” method into the UpdraftPlus class which can handle the use of the “options” argument or its absence when running across different PHP versions
* TWEAK: Add the UPDRAFTPLUS\_SEND\_UNWRITABLE\_BACKUP\_DIRECTORY\_EMAIL constant to disable the sending of unwritable backup directory emails to users.
* TWEAK: Clearer notifications to users regarding unconfigured remote storage settings and/or the selection of remote storage that are not part of their UpdraftPlus version
* TWEAK: During the resumption of OneDrive’s chunk uploads, the authorisation header and bearer token should not be included as it may lead to an unauthenticated error due to a different upload URL.
* TWEAK: Implement code to enable automatic activation of the UpdraftPlus plugin during the migration process from a multisite setup to a standalone site
* TWEAK: In a multisite environment, ensure that users can access the UpdraftPlus plugin page even in the absence of the WP\_ALLOW\_MULTISITE constant
* TWEAK: UpdraftClone now supports PHP 8.4

#### 1.23.4 – 16/May/2023

* SECURITY: Fixed a missing nonce combined with a URL sanitisation failure, which could lead to a targeted XSS opportunity (if an attacker persuades a logged-in administrator to both re-authorise their connection to a remote storage (e.g. Dropbox) and then to follow a link personally crafted for their site before re-authorising whilst logged in, he can then store a fixed JavaScript payload in the WP admin area (they would need a further route to use that ability to cause any damage). Because of the need for the administrator to co-operate in multiple steps, this attack is very unlikely (but you should of course still update).
* FIX: DigitalOcean S3-compatible storage does not work with disabled SSL entirely where possible settings.
* FIX: If there was an error or network connectivity issue on first attempt of uploading a plugin/theme file, then the second attempt of uploading the same file would make the file become corrupted thus resulting in installation failure.
* COMPATIBILITY: Suppress htmlspecialchars deprecation warnings on PHP 8.1
* COMPATIBILITY: Suppress some PHP 8.2 deprecation notices from use of ${} style variables, and others from use of dynamic properties
* TWEAK: Handle web hosting company setup that disabled pclose() but not popen()
* TWEAK: All HTTP requests to the Google Drive API now, by default, forces to use HTTP/1.1 version. Also, a constant named UPDRAFTPLUS\_GDRIVE\_CURL\_HTTP\_VERSION can be set in the wp-config.php file to change the default HTTP version to another preferred version
* TWEAK: Improve ‘move’ and ‘copy’ filesystem functions in restoring directories containing files to a different mount point/partition than where they reside
* TWEAK: Improve files pruning mechanism, by not repeating already-done ones when resuming deletions
* TWEAK: Improve the Handlebars templates of the Google Drive, Dropbox and UpdraftVault remote storage modules by taking PHP code out of them

#### 1.23.3 – 16/Mar/2023

* SECURITY: This release fixes an important security defect – please update. Full details: https://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-1-23-3-2-23-3-important-security-release/. Sites are affected if there are WordPress users (i.e. people who can login) who can reach the back-end (i.e. wp-admin) dashboard (but we recommend everyone updates in any case).

* FIX: A database backup couldn’t be taken from WP-Optimize and All-In-One Security (AIOS) (regression)
* TWEAK: Add a user capabilities check when downloading a backup (this is not believed to have any security implications, as the download operation already requires knowledge of a further nonce that there is no mechanism for a non-administrator to obtain).
* TWEAK: Improve the Handlebars template of the UpdraftVault remote storage by taking PHP code out of it
* TWEAK: Prevent making a nonce available to logged-in users who could not manage UpdraftPlus (this did not give access to any unauthorised actions)
* TWEAK: Improve the Handlebars template of the UpdraftVault remote storage by taking PHP code out of it
* TWEAK: Improve the Handlebars template of the pCloud remote storage by taking PHP code out of it

* FIX: pCloud error handling in chunked uploading did not pass the error message up to the logging layer
* FIX: Backups started under WP-CLI could not backup the database only without any files
* FIX: Couldn’t add any file/directory inclusion for “Other” entity due to access to one directory up from the current (ABSPATH) isn’t permitted
* FIX: Atomic restore is not renaming a few tables when not restoring specific tables by using the filter `updraftplus_restore_this_table`.
* FIX: Sometimes the “delete old directories” notice displayed even though the actual `-old` directory didn’t exist
* FIX: The restore point date time was incorrect in the restore screen when restoring the incremental backup, and the WordPress site has a non-GMT timezone set.

* TWEAK: Add a filter updraftplus\_mysqldump\_arguments to allow changing of arguments passed to the mysqldump binary when that is being used
* TWEAK: Include PHP version in default S3 user agent to aid debugging

* TWEAK: Use the function that lists our own cron schedules to simplify the way backup intervals are prepared and to avoid schedules mismatch
* TWEAK: Improve manual deletion of backup sets by setting up a time limit to a value defined in UPDRAFTPLUS\_SET\_TIME\_LIMIT constant to minimise chances of getting fatal error (maximum execution time exceeded)

On sites running on end-of-lifed PHP versions (<8.0) it was possible to read the beginning of the log file, causing an unintended information disclosure about the server environment, e.g. Apache version, PHP version and available memory (but current PHP versions are …
