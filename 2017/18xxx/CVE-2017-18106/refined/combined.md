### Description

The identifier\_hash for a session token in Atlassian Crowd before version 2.9.1 could potentially collide with an identifier\_hash for another user or a user in a different directory, this allows remote attackers who can authenticate to Crowd or an application using Crowd for authentication to gain access to another user's session provided they can make their identifier hash collide with another user's session identifier hash.
