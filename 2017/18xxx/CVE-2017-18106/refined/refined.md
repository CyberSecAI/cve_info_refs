- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The identifier\_hash for a session token in Atlassian Crowd before version 2.9.1 could potentially collide with an identifier\_hash for another user or a user in a different directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient randomness or poor hashing algorithm leading to predictable session identifiers. This results in session hijacking through hash collision.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers who can authenticate to Crowd or an application using Crowd for authentication can gain access to another user's session, provided they can make their identifier hash collide with another user's session identifier hash.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access. Attackers need to authenticate to Crowd or an application using Crowd for authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated users with the capability to generate session identifier hashes that collide with other users' session hashes.
