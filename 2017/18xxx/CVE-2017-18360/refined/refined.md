Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error in the `set_termios` function of the `io_ti` USB serial driver within the Linux kernel. This occurs when debugging is enabled and a high baud rate is requested that results in a zero divisor value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division-by-zero:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of the calculated divisor, leading to a division by zero when a specific baud rate is set.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The driver does not properly check or sanitize the user-provided baud rate settings, allowing for an exploitable condition to be reached.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A local attacker can trigger a system crash by manipulating the baud rate settings of a USB serial device. This is caused either by the division-by-zero error in the debug statement or by passing the zero divisor value to the firmware, which also causes a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker with the ability to interact with USB serial devices.
- **Baud Rate Manipulation:**  The attack involves setting a specific baud rate that results in a zero divisor, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system, with sufficient access to control or configure USB serial devices and set baud rates.
- **Debugging Enabled:** The debugging feature needs to be enabled in the kernel for the vulnerability to be triggered via the debug statement, although a crash can still be triggered by setting the baud rate that results in a zero divisor, even without debug enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved capping the baud rate at 461550 to avoid a zero divisor and also applies to the firmware, since it also appears to cause a crash when passed a zero divisor.
- The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's USB serial device driver for io_ti devices.
- Ubuntu Security Notices USN-3933-1 and USN-3933-2 identify this CVE and provide package updates to address it.
- The fix was introduced in commit `6aeb75e6adfaed16e58780309613a578fe1ee90b`.
- The bug report in bugzilla.suse.com confirms that this vulnerability can be triggered without root privileges and was fixed in SLES 12 SP2 and later.
