Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-18229:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ReadTIFFImage` function in `coders/tiff.c` of the GraphicsMagick library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Allocation Failure:** The code fails to properly validate the file size when allocating memory for scanlines, strips, and tiles within a TIFF image.
*   **Improper Size Restriction:** The file size is not adequately used to restrict the allocation of memory, leading to an attempt to allocate large chunks of memory that can result in a crash due to memory exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause a denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability, which can crash the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted TIFF image file to an application using GraphicsMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Access:** Attackers need to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the vulnerable application.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is an allocation failure due to the lack of proper file size validation when processing TIFF images. This flaw allows a remote attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition by providing a specially crafted TIFF image that forces GraphicsMagick to attempt very large memory allocations.
