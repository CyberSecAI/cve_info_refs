# Connectwise API Vulnerability

![Avatar](data:image/gif;base64...)

[John Nuttall](https://archive.ph/o/rdkeQ/https%3A//helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/profiles/482529367-John-Nuttall)

# PROBLEM

An issue has been identified with an ASMX page install by the ConnectWise application -
**ManagedIT.asmx**
This page is part of the Connectwise Integration with Kaseya and allows full direct access to the Kaseya VSA database.
If this page is available via the web interface, anyone with access to the page is able to run arbitrary SQL queries, both read and write, without authentication.
# SOLUTION

A test tool has been written to quickly identify whether your server is vulnerable.
Please
[click here](https://archive.ph/o/rdkeQ/https%3A//helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360022682931) to for download and instructions details.
Please upgrade to the latest version of the ConnectWise Integration, and remove all traces of the older connector, specifically the file **ManagedIT.asmx.**
# FURTHER INFORMATION

Please see the link below for information provided by Connectwise about this and direct any questions to your Connectwise Representative.

# owlky

What is this? This is a proof of concept exploit for a Kaseya & ConnectWise integration called ManagedITSync which allows ConnectWise to retrieve information about assets in your Kaseya database (to then generate Configurations in ConnectWise).

Specifically, this script targets the `KaseyaCwWebService/ManagedIT.asmx` endpoint which is installed on the Kaseya server. To be clear, this is not really an exploit with Kaseya's offering -- but rather the integration published by ConnectWise which happens to be installed on the Kaseya server.

I am releasing this for a few reasons:

* The interested vendors (ConnectWise and Kaseya) have been made aware of this for months. The vendor responsible (ConnectWise) has since pulled this integration from their Marketplace and published mitigation steps in the ConnectWise university ([here](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Documentation/140/Kaseya_-_IP_and_Domain_Restrictions)).
* I have been told by ConnectWise that an advisery has been sent to affected customers (including above mitigation steps)
* Since *certain parties* are aware of this existing I believe that all potentially affected parties should be aware so that they can ensure their systems are properly secured (you know, in case they did not receive any advisories from ConnectWise)

#### Usage

A few things... here are some examples.

```
$ ./owlky.py help

               available commands:
   )\___/(     owlky.py server(s) check
  {(K)v(Y)}    owlky.py server(s) dir-c
   {| ~ |}     owlky.py server(s) reset-support
   {/ ^ \}     owlky.py server(s) list-orgs
    `m-m`      owlky.py server(s) list-users

```

```
$ ./owlky.py kaseya.example.com list-orgs

Found 4 orgs at kaseya.example.com:
 - <REDACTED>
 - <REDACTED>

 - <REDACTED>

```

```
$ ./owlky.py kaseya.example.com reset-support
