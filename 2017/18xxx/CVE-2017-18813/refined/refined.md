This document describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NETGEAR ReadyNAS devices.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored XSS vulnerability present in ReadyNAS OS versions prior to 6.8.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the ReadyNAS device's web interface. This could lead to:
  - Account hijacking
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web interface
  - Further compromise of the device or network.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into input fields of the web interface. The injected code is then stored and executed when other users access the affected page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to write to fields in the web interface that are susceptible to stored XSS. The attacker will need to be a high-privileged user.
- The user interacting with the crafted content must be a logged-in user.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory mentions that all ReadyNAS OS 6 devices running versions prior to 6.8.0 are affected.
- The advisory lists numerous specific ReadyNAS models that are vulnerable.
- The provided CVSS v3 score is 5.2, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L, indicating a medium severity vulnerability. The vector string shows that the attack complexity is low, the attack vector is local, user interaction is required for the exploit to occur and the scope of the attack is changed. The confidentiality, integrity and availability impact are low.
- Netgear recommends updating to the latest firmware to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The advisory states that this vulnerability is not associated with a CVE ID.
