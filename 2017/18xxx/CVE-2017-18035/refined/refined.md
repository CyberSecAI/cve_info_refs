Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the `/rest/review-coverage-chart/1.0/data/<repository_name>/.json` REST endpoint within Atlassian Fisheye and Crucible.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authorization checks on the specified REST endpoint. This allows unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Remote attackers can determine the existence of a repository and access its review coverage statistics even if they do not have access to that repository. This could expose sensitive information about code review practices, development activity, and potentially reveal details about the project structure.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via the vulnerable REST endpoint.
- **Direct Request:** Attackers would need to send a direct request to the `/rest/review-coverage-chart/1.0/data/<repository_name>/.json` endpoint, specifying the repository name they are targeting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Fisheye or Crucible instance.
- **No authentication:** The attacker does not need to have any valid credentials or special permissions to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- Atlassian Fisheye and Crucible versions prior to 4.5.1 and 4.6.0 are vulnerable. Specifically, version 4.5.0 is mentioned as affected.

**Fix Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 4.5.1 and 4.6.0.
