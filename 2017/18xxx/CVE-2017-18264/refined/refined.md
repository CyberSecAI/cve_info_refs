Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how phpMyAdmin handles the `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword']` setting in certain PHP versions. Specifically, the intended restriction imposed by setting this to `false` can be bypassed in affected PHP versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended security measure of disallowing logins for users with no password when `$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword']` is set to `false`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows users with no password set to log in to phpMyAdmin, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the MySQL database.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Login Interface:** The attack vector is through the phpMyAdmin login interface, where a user can attempt to log in without providing a password, despite the configuration intending to prevent this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the phpMyAdmin instance.
- **MySQL User without Password:** The attacker needs to know or be able to create a MySQL user that has no password set.
- **Affected PHP version:** The server needs to be running a vulnerable PHP version (specifically PHP 5 and not PHP 7.0).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specifically linked to certain PHP versions, indicating a potential interaction between phpMyAdmin code and the PHP runtime environment.
- The provided information mentions that PHP 5 is affected, while PHP 7.0 is not.
- The provided text references CWE-661: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges, which is a good fit since the described vulnerability allows for access without proper credentials when configured to prevent that.
- The fix for this vulnerability involved code commits on both the 4.0 and 4.7 branches of phpMyAdmin.
- The severity is considered moderate.
