**Verification:**

The content from the Exponent CMS website and GitHub repository discusses the release of patch #6 for Exponent CMS version 2.4.1. Notably, it mentions a "security fix for rouge admins attempting to elevate their permissions." This is highly relevant to a privilege escalation vulnerability, which CVE-2017-18213 is likely to be, since the CVE description is a placeholder, and the description of the fix is likely related.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a flaw that allows "rouge admins" to elevate their permissions. The specific mechanism of this privilege escalation isn't detailed in the provided text.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is an insecure access control mechanism that fails to properly prevent unauthorized privilege escalation, allowing an administrator to gain higher permissions within the system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability would enable a rogue administrator to gain elevated privileges beyond those intended for them. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or complete control of the CMS.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is internal, meaning an attacker would need to already have administrator-level access within the Exponent CMS.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator within the Exponent CMS. No further details about the specific role or permissions within the system is provided by this content.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The patch notes emphasize that "All Exponent CMS users are encouraged to move their installations to v2.4.1 and to install this patch!" This clearly indicates the severity and importance of the vulnerability fixed.
*   The fix is included in the v2.4.1patch6 release.
* The specific mechanism for the privilege escalation is not described in the content.
