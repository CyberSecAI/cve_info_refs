{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ANNKE SP1 HD wireless camera's web interface does not properly sanitize the SSIDs when displaying available Wi-Fi access points during a site survey. It directly populates the SSIDs it sees into the web page, without sanitizing potentially malicious content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the camera's web interface, which will be executed when a user visits the wireless configuration page. This can be used to steal images from the camera or manipulate the cameraâ€™s pan/tilt functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A rogue access point with a crafted SSID containing JavaScript code."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in physical proximity to the target camera in order to set up a rogue Wi-Fi access point with the malicious SSID. The attacker would also need to know (or guess) when a user will access the wireless configuration page to view the available wifi access points."
