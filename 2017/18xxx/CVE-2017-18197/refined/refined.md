Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18197:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `mxGraphViewImageReader.java` class within the `libjgraphx-java` library, where a `SAXParserFactory` instance used in the `convert()` method lacks proper configuration to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Specifically, the flags necessary to disable external entity processing and doctype declarations are missing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to XXE attacks due to improper configuration of the SAX parser. The parser is not configured to prevent the loading of external entities and DTDs, enabling an attacker to potentially inject malicious XML that can cause the application to load external resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure/Access:** As evidenced by the example provided in the github issue, an attacker could force the application to attempt to read arbitrary local files from the server by injecting a malicious DTD.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XML Payload Injection:** An attacker would send a crafted XML payload to a vulnerable endpoint that uses the `mxGraphViewImageReader.java` class to process XML data. The crafted XML would include malicious external entity definitions.
- **POST request:** The exploit is triggered by sending a POST request with a malicious XML payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the affected application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** The attacker needs to know which application endpoints use the vulnerable `mxGraphViewImageReader.java` class.

**Additional details:**
- The github issue provides a specific example to reproduce the vulnerability with a simple XML payload that triggers an attempt to read a non-existent file.
- The fix for this vulnerability involved setting the necessary flags on the `SAXParserFactory` instance to prevent external entity resolution and DTD loading.
