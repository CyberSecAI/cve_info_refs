{
  "CVE-2017-18595": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A double free is caused by the function `allocate_trace_buffer` in the file `kernel/trace/trace.c`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Double Free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A double free may lead to denial of service, and potentially to privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unprivileged local attacker."
  },
  "CVE-2019-14821": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds access issue in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements the Coalesced MMIO write operation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged host user or process with access to `/dev/kvm` device could use this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service or potentially escalating privileges on the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unprivileged local attacker with access to `/dev/kvm`."
  },
    "CVE-2019-15291": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A NULL pointer dereference is caused by a malicious USB device in the `flexcop_usb_probe` function in the `drivers/media/usb/b2c2/flexcop-usb.c` driver.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "NULL Pointer Dereference"
      ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A NULL pointer dereference could lead to a denial of service.",
        "Attack vectors": "Physical access through a malicious USB device",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker with the ability to attach a malicious USB device."
  },
  "CVE-2019-9506": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification permits sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Insufficient Encryption Key Length"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can decrypt traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing. A practical brute-force attack (KNOB) is possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "Adjacent network",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker within adjacent network reach of the vulnerable device."
