**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can take complete control of the affected switch.
- They can gain access to configuration files.
- They can disrupt the normal operation of the switch.

**Attack vectors:**
