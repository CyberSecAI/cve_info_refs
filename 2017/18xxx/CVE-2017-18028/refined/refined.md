Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory exhaustion issue within the `ReadTIFFImage` function in `tiff.c` of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The `ReadTIFFImage` function allocates memory based on the `rows` value read from the TIFF file. This value is directly controlled by the input file, allowing an attacker to specify a large number of rows and trigger excessive memory allocation.
- **Bypass of Memory Limits:** The provided `policy.xml` with memory limits (e.g., 256MiB) is bypassed by the uncontrolled allocation, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a crafted TIFF file with a large "rows" value, an attacker can cause ImageMagick to allocate excessive memory, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service. The process may crash.
- **Potential Code Execution:** The Ubuntu Security Notice also mentions that there's a possibility of code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the program. Although not explicitly detailed in this github issue, this could result from memory corruption due to excessive memory allocation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious TIFF File:** The attacker crafts a malicious TIFF file.
- **Image Processing:**  The target is an application (like `convert`) that uses ImageMagick to process the crafted TIFF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious TIFF file to a system using ImageMagick.
- They do not require any special privileges on the target system, they would typically operate from a user context
