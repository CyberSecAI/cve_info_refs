The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a pre-authentication stack overflow vulnerability. This advisory includes information about affected products, impacted firmware versions, and recommendations for patching.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A pre-authentication stack overflow. This means the vulnerability can be exploited before the user is authenticated, and the root cause is an overflow of data in the stack memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack overflow vulnerability is present that can be triggered before user authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent network access, meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to exploit this issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network (adjacent) as the vulnerable device to exploit the pre-authentication stack overflow. No authentication is needed before exploitation.

**Affected Products:**

*   D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.28
*   R6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.16
*   R7500, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.112
*   R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.20
*   R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.36
*   R9000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.52
*   WNDR3700v4, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.88
*   WNDR4300, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.90
*   WNDR4300v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.48
*   WNDR4500v3, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.48

The advisory provides a CVSS v3 score of 8.8 (High) with the vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
