## FAQ

### How to change or override plugin templates?

Plugin template files can be found in the `/wp-content/plugins/realty/templates/` directory.

You can edit these files in an upgrade-safe way using overrides. Copy them into a directory with your theme named `/bws-templates`.

Example: To override the single gallery template, please copy `/wp-content/plugins/realty/templates/rlt-listing.php` to `wp-content/themes/your-theme/bws-templates/rlt-listing.php`.

Do not edit these files in the plugin’s core directly as they are overwritten during the upgrade process and any customizations will be lost.

### Where can I find the settings to adjust the plugin work after activation?

You can find a link to the settings page in your WordPress admin panel in “BWS Panel” > “Realty”.

### How do I use the plugin?

1. You can add the necessary Property types in “Properties” > “Property type” menu.
2. In the menu “Properties” > “Add New”. Select the necessary Propert type.
3. If you are using “Real Estate” theme, please create the Home page, select Home template for this page, and in “Settings” > “Reading Settings”, please select static Home page in “Front page displays” block.
4. If you are using another theme, on “Appearance” > “Widgets” page, please find “Sale Rent Widget” and add it to the sidebar of your theme.

### I have added Property, but nothing changed on my website. What do I do now?

1. If you are using “Real Estate” theme, please create the Home page, select Home template for this page, and in “Settings” > “Reading Settings”, please select static Home page in “Front page displays” block.
2. If you are using another theme, on “Appearance” > “Widgets” page, please find “Sale Rent Widget” and add it to the sidebar of your theme.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

1. the link to the page where the problem occurs
2. the name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.
3. the version of your WordPress installation
4. copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/)

Довольно удобный плагин для тех случаев, когда каталог будет заполняться менеджерами агентства недвижимости для которых вариант на основе вукомерс будет сложен.

This plugin is not friendly at all – many hours wasted hacking their code to try and get it to display properly in a theme not supported by the plugin (only their own theme is supported). Support is slow (not the 24 hours they guarantee pro clients) and tries to sell you their own brand of theme first to solve all the issues. Cannot recommend at all!

I have installed the plugin, and the display was not clear and was taking the background color, so wanted to de-activate and delete the plugin.. But the below was the error.. Could not find any errors log, so had to contact the server provider to solve the issue and delete the plugin.. I would recommend plugin for developers, but not for new people like me 🙂
Internal Server Error
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
Please contact the server administrator, and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.
More information about this error may be available in the server error log.
