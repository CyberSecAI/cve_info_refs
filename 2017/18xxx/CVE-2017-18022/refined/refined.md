```text
  - Root cause of vulnerability: ImageMagick incorrectly handles certain malformed image files, leading to memory leaks. Specifically, the `montage` command when processing a crafted input file leads to memory leaks due to improper resource management in `CloneMontageInfo` and `GetMontageInfo` functions.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory leaks due to improper resource management.
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service by exhausting memory, potentially leading to code execution.
  - Attack vectors: By tricking a user or an automated system to open a specially crafted image file using ImageMagick.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image to be processed by ImageMagick.
