## Description

Lets you create a content inventory right in the WordPress Edit screens, similar to the process you might use to assess your site’s content in a spreadsheet. You can mark content as redundant, outdated, trivial, or in need of a review for SEO or style. These content status labels work just like categories, so you can remove the built-in ones and add your own if you like. You can also assign a content owner (distinct from the original author) and keep internal notes. The IDs are revealed on the Edit screens so you can keep track of your content even if you change titles and permalinks. The plugin supports custom post types as well as posts, pages, and media files.

There’s an Overview report under the Dashboard menu that shows you which posts/pages/attachments/etc. need attention, sorted by user. This screen also lets you export a CSV file of the audit report.

The plugin creates three new filters on the Edit screens: author, content owner, and content status. This should make it easy to narrow your focus to just a few pages at a time.

You can display the audit details to logged-in editors on the front end if you want, either above or below the content. You can style the audit message with custom CSS.

**New:** you can now clear data from past audits and start over!

#### Translations

This is a light-weight plugin that’s very approachable.. I’ve found people like using it.
I could imagine more robust reporting features and other small polishes, but this plugin pretty much does exactly what it says and works great.

### [Simple plugin that meets a need](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-plugin-that-meets-a-need/)

Tried this out on my site last week. You can use it to label your posts and pages, then filter them by a criteria. So for example to find: all posts that need rewriting; or all pages that are up-to-date. There are a few additional features, such as emailing you when it’s more than a year since a post was updated.
On the whole, this is a nice and simple, sensible plugin to use, particularly on a website with a lot of content.
