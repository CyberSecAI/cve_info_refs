Based on the provided changelog, the following vulnerability information is present:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin had an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability.
- There was an SQL injection vulnerability due to an unescaped SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS vulnerability:** This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **SQL injection vulnerability:** This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** An attacker could potentially steal user session information, deface the website, or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **SQL injection:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or even take control of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XSS:** The vulnerability was present in the code of the plugin and could be exploited through user-controlled input or displayed data.
- **SQL injection:** The vulnerability was in the plugin's SQL query which could be manipulated to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For XSS, an attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts. This could be achieved through compromised admin accounts, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or through manipulated user input.
- For SQL injection, an attacker would need to be able to send requests to the WordPress site with crafted SQL queries.

**Versions affected:**
- Version 1.9.2 fixed the XSS issue reported by `https://security.dxw.com`.
- Version 1.6.1 fixed the SQL injection vulnerability reported by `https://security.dxw.com/`

**Mitigation:**
- The XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities were fixed in versions 1.9.2 and 1.6.1 respectively, so updating the plugin to these versions or later mitigates the vulnerabilities.
