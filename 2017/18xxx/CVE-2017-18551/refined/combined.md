MIPS: AR7: ensure the port type's FCR value is used
commit 0a5191efe06b5103909206e4fbcff81d30283f8e upstream.
Since commit aef9a7bd9b67 ("serial/uart/8250: Add tunable RX interrupt
trigger I/F of FIFO buffers"), the port's default FCR value isn't used
in serial8250\_do\_set\_termios anymore, but copied over once in
serial8250\_config\_port and then modified as needed.
Unfortunately, serial8250\_config\_port will never be called if the port
is shared between kernel and userspace, and the port's flag doesn't have
UPF\_BOOT\_AUTOCONF, which would trigger a serial8250\_config\_port as well.
This causes garbled output from userspace:
[ 5.220000] random: procd urandom read with 49 bits of entropy available
ers
[kee
Fix this by forcing it to be configured on boot, resulting in the
expected output:
[ 5.250000] random: procd urandom read with 50 bits of entropy available

mm, page\_vma\_mapped: Drop faulty pointer arithmetics in check\_pte()
commit 0d665e7b109d512b7cae3ccef6e8654714887844 upstream.
Tetsuo reported random crashes under memory pressure on 32-bit x86
system and tracked down to change that introduced
page\_vma\_mapped\_walk().
The root cause of the issue is the faulty pointer math in check\_pte().
As ->pte may point to an arbitrary page we have to check that they are
belong to the section before doing math. Otherwise it may lead to weird
results.
It wasn't noticed until now as mem\_map[] is virtually contiguous on
flatmem or vmemmap sparsemem. Pointer arithmetic just works against all
'struct page' pointers. But with classic sparsemem, it doesn't because
each section memap is allocated separately and so consecutive pfns
crossing two sections might have struct pages at completely unrelated
addresses.
Let's restructure code a bit and replace pointer arithmetic with
operations on pfns.

x86/mm: Rework wbinvd, hlt operation in stop\_this\_cpu()
commit f23d74f6c66c3697e032550eeef3f640391a3a7d upstream.
Some issues have been reported with the for loop in stop\_this\_cpu() that
issues the 'wbinvd; hlt' sequence. Reverting this sequence to halt()
has been shown to resolve the issue.
However, the wbinvd is needed when running with SME. The reason for the
wbinvd is to prevent cache flush races between encrypted and non-encrypted
entries that have the same physical address. This can occur when
kexec'ing from memory encryption active to inactive or vice-versa. The
important thing is to not have outside of kernel text memory references
(such as stack usage), so the usage of the native\_\*() functions is needed
since these expand as inline asm sequences. So instead of reverting the
change, rework the sequence.
Move the wbinvd instruction outside of the for loop as native\_wbinvd()
and make its execution conditional on X86\_FEATURE\_SME. In the for loop,
change the asm 'wbinvd; hlt' sequence back to a halt sequence but use
the native\_halt() call.

x86/retpoline: Optimize inline assembler for vmexit\_fill\_RSB
commit 3f7d875566d8e79c5e0b2c9a413e91b2c29e0854 upstream.
The generated assembler for the C fill RSB inline asm operations has
several issues:
- The C code sets up the loop register, which is then immediately
overwritten in \_\_FILL\_RETURN\_BUFFER with the same value again.
- The C code also passes in the iteration count in another register, which
is not used at all.
Remove these two unnecessary operations. Just rely on the single constant
passed to the macro for the iterations.

kprobes/x86: Disable optimizing on the function jumps to indirect thunk
commit c86a32c09f8ced67971a2310e3b0dda4d1749007 upstream.
Since indirect jump instructions will be replaced by jump
to \_\_x86\_indirect\_thunk\_\*, those jmp instruction must be
treated as an indirect jump. Since optprobe prohibits to
optimize probes in the function which uses an indirect jump,
it also needs to find out the function which jump to
\_\_x86\_indirect\_thunk\_\* and disable optimization.
Add a check that the jump target address is between the
\_\_indirect\_thunk\_start/end when optimizing kprobe.

KVM doesn't follow the SMCCC when it comes to unimplemented calls,

calls are now used for security mitigation, they are becoming more

Instead, let's follow the SMCCC which states that -1 must be returned

commit c507babf10ead4d5c8cca704539b170752a8ac84 upstream.
KVM only supports PMD hugepages at stage 2 but doesn't actually check

In cases where the backing hugepage size is smaller than PMD\_SIZE (such
as when using contiguous hugepages), KVM can end up creating stage 2
mappings that extend beyond the supplied memory.
Fix this by checking for the pagesize of userspace vma before creating
PMD hugepage at stage 2.

Since commit 68923cdc2eb3 ("MIPS: CM: Add cluster & block args to

mips\_cm\_lock\_other() with the first VPE in each core. Prior to r6,
multicore multithreaded systems such as dual-core dual-thread
interAptivs with CPU Idle enabled (e.g. MIPS Creator Ci40) results in
mips\_cm\_lock\_other() repeatedly hitting WARN\_ON(vp != 0).
There doesn't appear to be anything fundamentally wrong about passing a
non-zero VP/VPE number, even if it is a core's region that is locked
into the other region before r6, so remove that particular WARN\_ON().

alpha/PCI: Fix noname IRQ level detection
commit 86be89939d11a84800f66e2a283b915b704bf33d upstream.
The conversion of the alpha architecture PCI host bridge legacy IRQ
mapping/swizzling to the new PCI host bridge map/swizzle hooks carried
out through:
commit 0e4c2eeb758a ("alpha/PCI: Replace pci\_fixup\_irqs() call with
host bridge IRQ mapping hooks")
implies that IRQ for devices are now allocated through pci\_assign\_irq()
function in pci\_device\_probe() that is called when a driver matching a
device is found in order to probe the device through the device driver.
Alpha noname platforms required IRQ level programming to be executed
in sio\_fixup\_irq\_levels(), that is called in noname\_init\_pci(), a
platform hook called within a subsys\_initcall.
In noname\_init\_pci(), present IRQs are detected through
sio\_collect\_irq\_levels() that check the struct pci\_dev->irq number
to detect if an IRQ has been allocated for the device.
By the time sio\_collect\_irq\_levels() is called, some devices may still
have not a matching driver loaded to match them (eg loadable module)
therefore their IRQ allocation is still pending - which means that
sio\_collect\_irq\_levels() does not programme the correct IRQ level for
those devices, causing their IRQ handling to be broken when the device
driver is actually loaded and the device is probed.
Fix the issue by adding code in the noname map\_irq() function
(noname\_map\_irq()) that, whilst mapping/swizzling the IRQ line, it also
ensures that the correct IRQ level programming is executed at platform
level, fixing the issue.

wrong because IV is initialized later and we use wrong key

block).
The bug may cause data corruption if key is loaded via kernel keyring

same key in hexbyte representation, or vice versa. The bug (and fix)

dm thin metadata: THIN\_MAX\_CONCURRENT\_LOCKS should be 6
commit 490ae017f54e55bde382d45ea24bddfb6d1a0aaf upstream.
For btree removal, there is a corner case that a single thread
could takes 6 locks which is more than THIN\_MAX\_CONCURRENT\_LOCKS(5)
and leads to deadlock.
A btree removal might eventually call
rebalance\_children()->rebalance3() to rebalance entries of three
neighbor child nodes when shadow\_spine has already acquired two
write locks. In rebalance3(), it tries to shadow and acquire the
write locks of all three child nodes. However, shadowing a child
node requires acquiring a read lock of the original child node and
a write lock of the new block. Although the read lock will be
released after block shadowing, shadowing the third child node
in rebalance3() could still take the sixth lock.
(2 write locks for shadow\_spine +
2 write locks for the first two child nodes's shadow +
1 write lock for the last child node's shadow +
1 read lock for the last child node)

dm btree: fix serious bug in btree\_split\_beneath()
commit bc68d0a43560e950850fc69b58f0f8254b28f6d6 upstream.
When inserting a new key/value pair into a btree we walk down the spine of
btree nodes performing the following 2 operations:
i) space for a new entry
ii) adjusting the first key entry if the new key is lower than any in the node.
If the \_root\_ node is full, the function btree\_split\_beneath() allocates 2 new
nodes, and redistibutes the root nodes entries between them. The root node is
left with 2 entries corresponding to the 2 new nodes.
btree\_split\_beneath() then adjusts the spine to point to one of the two new
children. This means the first key is never adjusted if the new key was lower,
ie. operation (ii) gets missed out. This can result in the new key being
'lost' for a period; until another low valued key is inserted that will uncover
it.
This is a serious bug, and quite hard to make trigger in normal use. A
reproducing test case ("thin create devices-in-reverse-order") is
available as part of the thin-provision-tools project:
https://github.com/jthornber/thin-provisioning-tools/blob/master/functional-tests/device-mapper/dm-tests.scm#L593
Fix the issue by changing btree\_split\_beneath() so it no longer adjusts
the spine. Instead it unlocks both the new nodes, and lets the main
loop in btree\_insert\_raw() relock the appropriate one and make any
neccessary adjustments.

commit 8a510a5c75261ba0ec39155326982aa786541e29 upstream.
It looks like in all cases 'struct vmw\_connector\_state' is used. But
only in stdu connectors, was atomic\_{duplicate,destroy}\_state() properly
subclassed. Leading to writes beyond the end of the allocated connector
state block and all sorts of fun memory corruption related crashes.

workqueue: avoid hard lockups in show\_workqueue\_state()

show\_workqueue\_state() can print out a lot of messages while being in
atomic context, e.g. sysrq-t -> show\_workqueue\_state(). If the console
device is slow it may end up triggering NMI hard lockup watchdog.

On a I2C\_SMBUS\_I2C\_BLOCK\_DATA read request, if data->block[0] is
greater than I2C\_SMBUS\_BLOCK\_MAX + 1, the underlying I2C driver writes
data out of the msgbuf1 array boundary.
It is possible from a user application to run into that issue by
calling the I2C\_SMBUS ioctl with data.block[0] greater than
I2C\_SMBUS\_BLOCK\_MAX + 1.
This patch makes the code compliant with
Documentation/i2c/dev-interface by raising an error when the requested
size is larger than 32 bytes.

ARM: dts: kirkwood: fix pin-muxing of MPP7 on OpenBlocks A7
commit 56aeb07c914a616ab84357d34f8414a69b140cdf upstream.
MPP7 is currently muxed as "gpio", but this function doesn't exist for
MPP7, only "gpo" is available. This causes the following error:
kirkwood-pinctrl f1010000.pin-controller: unsupported function gpio on pin mpp7
pinctrl core: failed to register map default (6): invalid type given
kirkwood-pinctrl f1010000.pin-controller: error claiming hogs: -22
kirkwood-pinctrl f1010000.pin-controller: could not claim hogs: -22
kirkwood-pinctrl f1010000.pin-controller: unable to register pinctrl driver
kirkwood-pinctrl: probe of f1010000.pin-controller failed with error -22
So the pinctrl driver is not probed, all device drivers (including the
UART driver) do a -EPROBE\_DEFER, and therefore the system doesn't
really boot (well, it boots, but with no UART, and no devices that
require pin-muxing).
Back when the Device Tree file for this board was introduced, the
definition was already wrong. The pinctrl driver also always described
as "gpo" this function for MPP7. However, between Linux 4.10 and 4.11,
a hog pin failing to be muxed was turned from a simple warning to a
hard error that caused the entire pinctrl driver probe to bail
out. This is probably the result of commit 6118714275f0a ("pinctrl:
core: Fix pinctrl\_register\_and\_init() with pinctrl\_enable()").
This commit fixes the Device Tree to use the proper "gpo" function for
MPP7, which fixes the boot of OpenBlocks A7, which was broken since
Linux 4.11.

phy: work around 'phys' references to usb-nop-xceiv devices
commit b7563e2796f8b23c98afcfea7363194227fa089d upstream.
Stefan Wahren reports a problem with a warning fix that was merged
for v4.15: we had lots of device nodes with a 'phys' property pointing
to a device node that is not compliant with the binding documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt
This generally works because USB HCD drivers that support both the generic
phy subsystem and the older usb-phy subsystem ignore most errors from
phy\_get() and related calls and then use the usb-phy driver instead.
However, it turns out that making the usb-nop-xceiv device compatible with
the generic-phy binding changes the phy\_get() return code from -EINVAL to
-EPROBE\_DEFER, and the dwc2 usb controller driver for bcm2835 now returns
-EPROBE\_DEFER from its probe function rather than ignoring the failure,
breaking all USB support on raspberry-pi when CONFIG\_GENERIC\_PHY is
enabled. The same code is used in the dwc3 driver and the usb\_add\_hcd()
function, so a reasonable assumption would be that many other platforms
are affected as well.
I have reviewed all the related patches and concluded that "usb-nop-xceiv"
is the only USB phy that is affected by the change, and since it is by far
the most commonly referenced phy, all the other USB phy drivers appear
to be used in ways that are are either safe in DT (they don't use the
'phys' property), or in the driver (they already ignore -EPROBE\_DEFER
from generic-phy when usb-phy is available).
To work around the problem, this adds a special case to \_of\_phy\_get()
so we ignore any PHY node that is compatible with "usb-nop-xceiv",
as we know that this can never load no matter how much we defer. In the
future, we might implement a generic-phy driver for "usb-nop-xceiv"
and then remove this workaround.
Since we generally want older kernels to also want to work with the
fixed devicetree files, it would be good to backport the patch into
stable kernels as well (3.13+ are possibly affected), even though they
don't contain any of the patches that may have caused regressions.

tracing: Fix converting enum's from the map in trace\_event\_eval\_update()
commit 1ebe1eaf2f02784921759992ae1fde1a9bec8fd0 upstream.
Since enums do not get converted by the TRACE\_EVENT macro into their values,
the event format displaces the enum name and not the value. This breaks
tools like perf and trace-cmd that need to interpret the raw binary data. To
solve this, an enum map was created to convert these enums into their actual
numbers on boot up. This is done by TRACE\_EVENTS() adding a
TRACE\_DEFINE\_ENUM() macro.
Some enums were not being converted. This was caused by an optization that
had a bug in it.
All calls get checked against this enum map to see if it should be converted
or not, and it compares the call's system to the system that the enum map
was created under. If they match, then they call is processed.
To cut down on the number of iterations needed to find the maps with a
matching system, since calls and maps are grouped by system, when a match is
made, the index into the map array is saved, so that the next call, if it
belongs to the same system as the previous call, could start right at that
array index and not have to scan all the previous arrays.
The problem was, the saved index was used as the variable to know if this is
a call in a new system or not. If the index was zero, it was assumed that
the call is in a new system and would keep incrementing the saved index
until it found a matching system. The issue arises when the first matching
system was at index zero. The next map, if it belonged to the same system,
would then think it was the first match and increment the index to one. If
the next call belong to the same system, it would begin its search of the
maps off by one, and miss the first enum that should be converted. This left
a single enum not converted properly.
Also add a comment to describe exactly what that index was for. It took me a
bit too long to figure out what I was thinking when debugging this issue.

Input: ALPS - fix multi-touch decoding on SS4 plus touchpads
commit 4d94e776bd29670f01befa27e12df784fa05fa2e upstream.
The fix for handling two-finger scroll (i4a646580f793 - "Input: ALPS -
fix two-finger scroll breakage in right side on ALPS touchpad")
introduced a minor "typo" that broke decoding of multi-touch events are
decoded on some ALPS touchpads. For example, tapping with three-fingers
can no longer be used to emulate middle-mouse-button (the kernel doesn't
recognize this as the proper event, and doesn't report it correctly to
userspace). This affects touchpads that use SS4 "plus" protocol
variant, like those found on Dell E7270 & E7470 laptops (tested on
E7270).
First, probably the code in alps\_decode\_ss4\_v2() for case
SS4\_PACKET\_ID\_MULTI used inconsistent indices to "f->mt[]". You can see
0 & 1 are used for the "if" part but 2 & 3 are used for the "else" part.
Second, in the previous patch, new macros were introduced to decode X
coordinates specific to the SS4 "plus" variant, but the macro to
define the maximum X value wasn't changed accordingly. The macros to
decode X values for "plus" variant are effectively shifted right by 1
bit, but the max wasn't shifted too. This causes the driver to
incorrectly handle "no data" cases, which also interfered with how
multi-touch was handled.

x86/mm: Encrypt the initrd earlier for BSP microcode update
commit 107cd2532181b96c549e8f224cdcca8631c3076b upstream.
Currently the BSP microcode update code examines the initrd very early
in the boot process. If SME is active, the initrd is treated as being
encrypted but it has not been encrypted (in place) yet. Update the
early boot code that encrypts the kernel to also encrypt the initrd so
that early BSP microcode updates work.

x86/mm: Prepare sme\_encrypt\_kernel() for PAGE aligned encryption
commit cc5f01e28d6c60f274fd1e33b245f679f79f543c upstream.
In preparation for encrypting more than just the kernel, the encryption
support in sme\_encrypt\_kernel() needs to support 4KB page aligned
encryption instead of just 2MB large page aligned encryption.
Update the routines that populate the PGD to support non-2MB aligned
addresses. This is done by creating PTE page tables for the start
and end portion of the address range that fall outside of the 2MB
alignment. This results in, at most, two extra pages to hold the
PTE entries for each mapping of a range.

pipe: avoid round\_pipe\_size() nr\_pages overflow on 32-bit
commit d3f14c485867cfb2e0c48aa88c41d0ef4bf5209c upstream.
round\_pipe\_size() contains a right-bit-shift expression which may
overflow, which would cause undefined results in a subsequent
roundup\_pow\_of\_two() call.
static inline unsigned int round\_pipe\_size(unsigned int size)
{
unsigned long nr\_pages;
nr\_pages = (size + PAGE\_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE\_SHIFT;
return roundup\_pow\_of\_two(nr\_pages) << PAGE\_SHIFT;
}
PAGE\_SIZE is defined as (1UL << PAGE\_SHIFT), so:
- 4 bytes wide on 32-bit (0 to 0xffffffff)
- 8 bytes wide on 64-bit (0 to 0xffffffffffffffff)
That means that 32-bit round\_pipe\_size(), nr\_pages may overflow to 0:
size=0x00000000 nr\_pages=0x0
size=0x00000001 nr\_pages=0x1
size=0xfffff000 nr\_pages=0xfffff
size=0xfffff001 nr\_pages=0x0 << !
size=0xffffffff nr\_pages=0x0 << !
This is bad because roundup\_pow\_of\_two(n) is undefined when n == 0!
64-bit is not a problem as the unsigned int size is 4 bytes wide
(similar to 32-bit) and the larger, 8 byte wide unsigned long, is
sufficient to handle the largest value of the bit shift expression:
size=0xffffffff nr\_pages=100000
Modify round\_pipe\_size() to return 0 if n == 0 and updates its callers to
handle accordingly.

x86/tsc: Fix erroneous TSC rate on Skylake Xeon
commit b511203093489eb1829cb4de86e8214752205ac6 upstream.
The INTEL\_FAM6\_SKYLAKE\_X hardcoded crystal\_khz value of 25MHZ is
problematic:
- SKX workstations (with same model # as server variants) use a 24 MHz
crystal. This results in a -4.0% time drift rate on SKX workstations.
- SKX servers subject the crystal to an EMI reduction circuit that reduces its
actual frequency by (approximately) -0.25%. This results in -1 second per
10 minute time drift as compared to network time.
This issue can also trigger a timer and power problem, on configurations
that use the LAPIC timer (versus the TSC deadline timer). Clock ticks
scheduled with the LAPIC timer arrive a few usec before the time they are
expected (according to the slow TSC). This causes Linux to poll-idle, when
it should be in an idle power saving state. The idle and clock code do not
graciously recover from this error, sometimes resulting in significant
polling and measurable power impact.
Stop using native\_calibrate\_tsc() for INTEL\_FAM6\_SKYLAKE\_X.
native\_calibrate\_tsc() will return 0, boot will run with tsc\_khz = cpu\_khz,
and the TSC refined calibration will update tsc\_khz to correct for the
difference.

x86/tsc: Future-proof native\_calibrate\_tsc()
commit da4ae6c4a0b8dee5a5377a385545d2250fa8cddb upstream.
If the crystal frequency cannot be determined via CPUID(15).crystal\_khz or
the built-in table then native\_calibrate\_tsc() will still set the
X86\_FEATURE\_TSC\_KNOWN\_FREQ flag which prevents the refined TSC calibration.
As a consequence such systems use cpu\_khz for the TSC frequency which is
incorrect when cpu\_khz != tsc\_khz resulting in time drift.
Return early when the crystal frequency cannot be retrieved without setting
the X86\_FEATURE\_TSC\_KNOWN\_FREQ flag. This ensures that the refined TSC
calibration is invoked.

candidate for confusion. So pass in si\_signo and check for SIG\_SEGV to

x86/intel\_rdt/cqm: Prevent use after free
commit d47924417319e3b6a728c0b690f183e75bc2a702 upstream.

module: Add retpoline tag to VERMAGIC
commit 6cfb521ac0d5b97470883ff9b7facae264b7ab12 upstream.
Add a marker for retpoline to the module VERMAGIC. This catches the case
when a non RETPOLINE compiled module gets loaded into a retpoline kernel,
making it insecure.
It doesn't handle the case when retpoline has been runtime disabled. Even
in this case the match of the retcompile status will be enforced. This
implies that even with retpoline run time disabled all modules loaded need
to be recompiled.

x86/cpufeature: Move processor tracing out of scattered features
commit 4fdec2034b7540dda461c6ba33325dfcff345c64 upstream.
Processor tracing is already enumerated in word 9 (CPUID[7,0].EBX),
so do not duplicate it in the scattered features word.
Besides being more tidy, this will be useful for KVM when it presents
processor tracing to the guests. KVM selects host features that are
supported by both the host kernel (depending on command line options,
CPU errata, or whatever) and KVM. Whenever a full feature word exists,
KVM's code is written in the expectation that the CPUID bit number
matches the X86\_FEATURE\_\* bit number, but this is not the case for
X86\_FEATURE\_INTEL\_PT.

x86/retpoline: Add LFENCE to the retpoline/RSB filling RSB macros
commit 28d437d550e1e39f805d99f9f8ac399c778827b7 upstream.
The PAUSE instruction is currently used in the retpoline and RSB filling
macros as a speculation trap. The use of PAUSE was originally suggested
because it showed a very, very small difference in the amount of
cycles/time used to execute the retpoline as compared to LFENCE. On AMD,
the PAUSE instruction is not a serializing instruction, so the pause/jmp
loop will use excess power as it is speculated over waiting for return
to mispredict to the correct target.
The RSB filling macro is applicable to AMD, and, if software is unable to
verify that LFENCE is serializing on AMD (possible when running under a
hypervisor), the generic retpoline support will be used and, so, is also
applicable to AMD. Keep the current usage of PAUSE for Intel, but add an
LFENCE instruction to the speculation trap for AMD.
The same sequence has been adopted by GCC for the GCC generated retpolines.

x86/retpoline: Fill RSB on context switch for affected CPUs
commit c995efd5a740d9cbafbf58bde4973e8b50b4d761 upstream.
On context switch from a shallow call stack to a deeper one, as the CPU
does 'ret' up the deeper side it may encounter RSB entries (predictions for
where the 'ret' goes to) which were populated in userspace.
This is problematic if neither SMEP nor KPTI (the latter of which marks
userspace pages as NX for the kernel) are active, as malicious code in
userspace may then be executed speculatively.
Overwrite the CPU's return prediction stack with calls which are predicted
to return to an infinite loop, to "capture" speculation if this
happens. This is required both for retpoline, and also in conjunction with
IBRS for !SMEP && !KPTI.
On Skylake+ the problem is slightly different, and an \*underflow\* of the
RSB may cause errant branch predictions to occur. So there it's not so much
overwrite, as \*filling\* the RSB to attempt to prevent it getting
empty. This is only a partial solution for Skylake+ since there are many
other conditions which may result in the RSB becoming empty. The full
solution on Skylake+ is to use IBRS, which will prevent the problem even
when the RSB becomes empty. With IBRS, the RSB-stuffing will not be
required on context switch.

mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: Fix i.MX53 eSDHCv3 clock
commit 499ed50f603b4c9834197b2411ba3bd9aaa624d4 upstream.
Commit 5143c953a786 ("mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: Allow all supported
prescaler values") made it possible to set SYSCTL.SDCLKFS to 0 in SDR
mode, thus bypassing the SD clock frequency prescaler, in order to be
able to get higher SD clock frequencies in some contexts. However, that
commit missed the fact that this value is illegal on the eSDHCv3
instance of the i.MX53. This seems to be the only exception on i.MX,
this value being legal even for the eSDHCv2 instances of the i.MX53.
Fix this issue by changing the minimum prescaler value if the i.MX53
eSDHCv3 is detected. According to the i.MX53 reference manual, if
DLLCTRL[10] can be set, then the controller is eSDHCv3, else it is
eSDHCv2.
This commit fixes the following issue, which was preventing the i.MX53

objtool: Fix seg fault with gold linker
commit 2a0098d70640dda192a79966c14d449e7a34d675 upstream.
Objtool segfaults when the gold linker is used with
CONFIG\_MODVERSIONS=y and CONFIG\_UNWINDER\_ORC=y.
With CONFIG\_MODVERSIONS=y, the .o file gets passed to the linker before
being passed to objtool. The gold linker seems to strip unused ELF
symbols by default, which confuses objtool and causes the seg fault when
it's trying to generate ORC metadata.
Objtool should really be running immediately after GCC anyway, without a
linker call in between. Change the makefile ordering so that objtool is
called before the linker.

delayacct: Account blkio completion on the correct task
commit c96f5471ce7d2aefd0dda560cc23f08ab00bc65d upstream.
Before commit:
e33a9bba85a8 ("sched/core: move IO scheduling accounting from io\_schedule\_timeout() into scheduler")
delayacct\_blkio\_end() was called after context-switching into the task which
completed I/O.
This resulted in double counting: the task would account a delay both waiting
for I/O and for time spent in the runqueue.
With e33a9bba85a8, delayacct\_blkio\_end() is called by try\_to\_wake\_up().
In ttwu, we have not yet context-switched. This is more correct, in that
the delay accounting ends when the I/O is complete.
But delayacct\_blkio\_end() relies on 'get\_current()', and we have not yet
context-switched into the task whose I/O completed. This results in the
wrong task having its delay accounting statistics updated.
Instead of doing that, pass the task\_struct being woken to delayacct\_blkio\_end(),
so that it can update the statistics of the correct task.

ALSA: pcm: Remove yet superfluous WARN\_ON()
commit 23b19b7b50fe1867da8d431eea9cd3e4b6328c2c upstream.
muldiv32() contains a snd\_BUG\_ON() (which is morphed as WARN\_ON() with
debug option) for checking the case of 0 / 0. This would be helpful
if this happens only as a logical error; however, since the hw refine
is performed with any data set provided by user, the inconsistent
values that can trigger such a condition might be passed easily.
Actually, syzbot caught this by passing some zero'ed old hw\_params
ioctl.
So, having snd\_BUG\_ON() there is simply superfluous and rather
harmful to give unnecessary confusions. Let's get rid of it.

ALSA: seq: Make ioctls race-free
commit b3defb791b26ea0683a93a4f49c77ec45ec96f10 upstream.
The ALSA sequencer ioctls have no protection against racy calls while
the concurrent operations may lead to interfere with each other. As
reported recently, for example, the concurrent calls of setting client
pool with a combination of write calls may lead to either the
unkillable dead-lock or UAF.
As a slightly big hammer solution, this patch introduces the mutex to
make each ioctl exclusive. Although this may reduce performance via
parallel ioctl calls, usually it's not demanded for sequencer usages,
hence it should be negligible.

futex: Avoid violating the 10th rule of futex

futex(WAIT\_REQUEUE\_PI, uaddr, uaddr2,
timeout=[N ms])
futex\_wait\_requeue\_pi()
futex\_wait\_queue\_me()

futex(CMP\_REQUEUE\_PI, uaddr,
uaddr2, 1, 0)
/\* requeues waiter to uaddr2 \*/
futex(UNLOCK\_PI, uaddr2)
wake\_futex\_pi()
cmp\_futex\_value\_locked(uaddr2, waiter)
wake\_up\_q()
task>
futex(LOCK\_PI, uaddr2)
\_\_rt\_mutex\_start\_proxy\_lock()
try\_to\_take\_rt\_mutex() /\* steals lock \*/
rt\_mutex\_set\_owner(lock, stealer)
rt\_mutex\_wait\_proxy\_lock()
\_\_rt\_mutex\_slowlock()
try\_to\_take\_rt\_mutex() /\* fails, lock held by stealer \*/
if (timeout && !timeout->task)
return -ETIMEDOUT;
fixup\_owner()
/\* lock wasn't acquired, so,
fixup\_pi\_state\_owner skipped \*/
return -ETIMEDOUT;
/\* At this point, we've returned -ETIMEDOUT to userspace, but the
\* futex word shows waiter to be the owner, and the pi\_mutex has
\* stealer as the owner \*/
futex\_lock(LOCK\_PI, uaddr2)
-> bails with EDEADLK, futex word says we're owner.
And suggested that what commit:
73d786bd043e ("futex: Rework inconsistent rt\_mutex/futex\_q state")
removes from fixup\_owner() looks to be just what is needed. And indeed
it is -- I completely missed that requeue\_pi could also result in this
case. So we need to restore that, except that subsequent patches, like
commit:
16ffa12d7425 ("futex: Pull rt\_mutex\_futex\_unlock() out from under hb->lock")
changed all the locking rules. Even without that, the sequence:
- if (rt\_mutex\_futex\_trylock(&q->pi\_state->pi\_mutex)) {
- locked = 1;
- goto out;
- }
- raw\_spin\_lock\_irq(&q->pi\_state->pi\_mutex.wait\_lock);
- owner = rt\_mutex\_owner(&q->pi\_state->pi\_mutex);
- if (!owner)
- owner = rt\_mutex\_next\_owner(&q->pi\_state->pi\_mutex);
- raw\_spin\_unlock\_irq(&q->pi\_state->pi\_mutex.wait\_lock);
- ret = fixup\_pi\_state\_owner(uaddr, q, owner);
already suggests there were races; otherwise we'd never have to look
at next\_owner.
So instead of doing 3 consecutive wait\_lock sections with who knows
what races, we do it all in a single section. Additionally, the usage
of pi\_state->owner in fixup\_owner() was only safe because only the
rt\_mutex owner would modify it, which this additional case wrecks.
Luckily the values can only change away and not to the value we're
testing, this means we can do a speculative test and double check once
we have the wait\_lock.

powerpc/64s: Support disabling RFI flush with no\_rfi\_flush and nopti
commit bc9c9304a45480797e13a8e1df96ffcf44fb62fe upstream.
Because there may be some performance overhead of the RFI flush, add
kernel command line options to disable it.
We add a sensibly named 'no\_rfi\_flush' option, but we also hijack the
x86 option 'nopti'. The RFI flush is not the same as KPTI, but if we
see 'nopti' we can guess that the user is trying to avoid any overhead
of Meltdown mitigations, and it means we don't have to educate every
one about a different command line option.

powerpc/64s: Add support for RFI flush of L1-D cache
commit aa8a5e0062ac940f7659394f4817c948dc8c0667 upstream.
On some CPUs we can prevent the Meltdown vulnerability by flushing the
L1-D cache on exit from kernel to user mode, and from hypervisor to
guest.
This is known to be the case on at least Power7, Power8 and Power9. At
this time we do not know the status of the vulnerability on other CPUs
such as the 970 (Apple G5), pasemi CPUs (AmigaOne X1000) or Freescale
CPUs. As more information comes to light we can enable this, or other
mechanisms on those CPUs.
The vulnerability occurs when the load of an architecturally
inaccessible memory region (eg. userspace load of kernel memory) is
speculatively executed to the point where its result can influence the
address of a subsequent speculatively executed load.
In order for that to happen, the first load must hit in the L1,
because before the load is sent to the L2 the permission check is
performed. Therefore if no kernel addresses hit in the L1 the
vulnerability can not occur. We can ensure that is the case by
flushing the L1 whenever we return to userspace. Similarly for
hypervisor vs guest.
In order to flush the L1-D cache on exit, we add a section of nops at
each (h)rfi location that returns to a lower privileged context, and
patch that with some sequence. Newer firmwares are able to advertise
to us that there is a special nop instruction that flushes the L1-D.
If we do not see that advertised, we fall back to doing a displacement
flush in software.
For guest kernels we support migration between some CPU versions, and
different CPUs may use different flush instructions. So that we are
prepared to migrate to a machine with a different flush instruction
activated, we may have to patch more than one flush instruction at
boot if the hypervisor tells us to.
In the end this patch is mostly the work of Nicholas Piggin and
Michael Ellerman. However a cast of thousands contributed to analysis
of the issue, earlier versions of the patch, back ports testing etc.
Many thanks to all of them.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 38 vulnerabilities and has 159 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.0 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-18551: There was an out of bounds write in the function
i2c\_smbus\_xfer\_emulated (bnc#1146163).
- CVE-2018-20976: A use after free exists, related to xfs\_fs\_fill\_super
failure (bnc#1146285).
- CVE-2018-21008: A use-after-free can be caused by the function
rsi\_mac80211\_detach in the file
drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi\_91x\_mac80211.c (bnc#1149591).
- CVE-2019-14814: A heap overflow in mwifiex\_set\_uap\_rates() function of
Marvell was fixed. (bnc#1146512).
- CVE-2019-14815: A heap overflow in mwifiex\_set\_wmm\_params() function of
Marvell Wifi Driver was fixed. (bnc#1146514).
- CVE-2019-14816: A heap overflow in mwifiex\_update\_vs\_ie() function of
Marvell Wifi Driver was fixed. (bnc#1146516).
- CVE-2019-14835: A vhost/vhost\_net kernel buffer overflow could lead to
guest to host kernel escape during live migration (bnc#1150112).
- CVE-2019-15030: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local
user can read vector registers of other users' processes via a Facility
Unavailable exception. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts
a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin)
and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers
will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process
because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check (bnc#1149713).
- CVE-2019-15031: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local
user can read vector registers of other users' processes via an
interrupt. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a
transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin)
and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers
will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process,
because MSR\_TM\_ACTIVE is misused in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c
(bnc#1149713).
- CVE-2019-15090: In the qedi\_dbg\_\* family of functions, there was an
out-of-bounds read (bnc#1146399).
- CVE-2019-15098: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c had a NULL pointer
dereference via an incomplete address in an endpoint descriptor
(bnc#1146378).
- CVE-2019-15117: parse\_audio\_mixer\_unit in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux
kernel mishandled a short descriptor, leading to out-of-bounds memory
access (bnc#1145920).
- CVE-2019-15118: check\_input\_term in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux
kernel mishandled recursion, leading to kernel stack exhaustion
(bnc#1145922).
- CVE-2019-15211: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-dev.c driver because
drivers/media/radio/radio-raremono.c did not properly allocate memory
(bnc#1146519).
- CVE-2019-15212: There was a double-free caused by a malicious USB device
in the drivers/usb/misc/rio500.c driver (bnc#1146391).
- CVE-2019-15214: There was a use-after-free in the sound subsystem
because card disconnection causes certain data structures to be deleted
too early. This is related to sound/core/init.c and sound/core/info.c
(bnc#1146550).
- CVE-2019-15215: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2\_usb.c driver (bnc#1146425).
- CVE-2019-15216: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c driver
(bnc#1146361).
- CVE-2019-15217: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/zr364xx/zr364xx.c driver
(bnc#1146547).
- CVE-2019-15218: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver
(bnc#1146413).
- CVE-2019-15219: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/sisusbvga/sisusb.c driver
(bnc#1146524).
- CVE-2019-15220: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/net/wireless/intersil/p54/p54usb.c driver
(bnc#1146526).
- CVE-2019-15221: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the sound/usb/line6/pcm.c driver (bnc#1146529).
- CVE-2019-15222: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the sound/usb/helper.c (motu\_microbookii) driver
(bnc#1146531).
- CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp\_output.c
change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly
backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new
vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was
intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write
queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can
trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel
crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. (bnc#1146589)
- CVE-2019-15290: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the ath6kl\_usb\_alloc\_urb\_from\_pipe function in
the drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c driver (bnc#1146378
bnc#1146543).
- CVE-2019-15292: There was a use-after-free in atalk\_proc\_exit, related
to net/appletalk/atalk\_proc.c, net/appletalk/ddp.c, and
net/appletalk/sysctl\_net\_atalk.c (bnc#1146678).
- CVE-2019-15538: XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of
being out of disk quota. xfs\_setattr\_nonsize is failing to unlock the
ILOCK after the xfs\_qm\_vop\_chown\_reserve call fails. This is primarily a
local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if
the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS (bnc#1148093).
- CVE-2019-15666: There was an out-of-bounds array access in
\_\_xfrm\_policy\_unlink, which will cause denial of service, because
verify\_newpolicy\_info in net/xfrm/xfrm\_user.c mishandled directory
validation (bnc#1148394).
- CVE-2019-15902: Misuse of the upstream "x86/ptrace: Fix possible
spectre-v1 in ptrace\_get\_debugreg()" commit reintroduced the Spectre
vulnerability that it aimed to eliminate. This occurred because the
backport process depends on cherry picking specific commits, and because
two (correctly ordered) code lines were swapped (bnc#1149376).
- CVE-2019-15917: There was a use-after-free issue when
hci\_uart\_register\_dev() fails in hci\_uart\_set\_proto() in
drivers/bluetooth/hci\_ldisc.c (bnc#1149539).
- CVE-2019-15919: SMB2\_write in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free
(bnc#1149552).
- CVE-2019-15920: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel SMB2\_read in
fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free. NOTE: this was not fixed
correctly in 5.0.10; see the 5.0.11 ChangeLog, which documents a memory
leak (bnc#1149626).
- CVE-2019-15921: There was a memory leak issue when idr\_alloc() fails in
genl\_register\_family() in net/netlink/genetlink.c (bnc#1149602).
- CVE-2019-15924: The fm10k\_init\_module in
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/fm10k/fm10k\_main.c had a NULL pointer
dereference because there is no -ENOMEM upon an alloc\_workqueue failure
(bnc#1149612).
- CVE-2019-15926: Out of bounds access exists in the functions
ath6kl\_wmi\_pstream\_timeout\_event\_rx and ath6kl\_wmi\_cac\_event\_rx in the
file drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c (bnc#1149527).
- CVE-2019-15927: An out-of-bounds access exists in the function
build\_audio\_procunit in the file sound/usb/mixer.c (bnc#1149522).
- CVE-2019-9456: In USB monitor driver there is a possible OOB write due
to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of
privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
not needed for exploitation (bnc#1150025).

i2c: core-smbus: prevent stack corruption on read I2C\_BLOCK\_DATAOn a I2C\_SMBUS\_I2C\_BLOCK\_DATA read request, if data->block[0] is
greater than I2C\_SMBUS\_BLOCK\_MAX + 1, the underlying I2C driver writes
data out of the msgbuf1 array boundary.
It is possible from a user application to run into that issue by
calling the I2C\_SMBUS ioctl with data.block[0] greater than
I2C\_SMBUS\_BLOCK\_MAX + 1.
This patch makes the code compliant with
Documentation/i2c/dev-interface by raising an error when the requested
size is larger than 32 bytes.

An update that solves 39 vulnerabilities and has 203 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.1 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-18551: There was an out of bounds write in the function
i2c\_smbus\_xfer\_emulated (bnc#1146163).
- CVE-2018-20976: A use after free exists, related to xfs\_fs\_fill\_super
failure (bnc#1146285).
- CVE-2018-21008: A use-after-free can be caused by the function
rsi\_mac80211\_detach in the file
drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi\_91x\_mac80211.c (bnc#1149591).
- CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816: Fix three heap-based
buffer overflows in marvell wifi chip driver kernel, that allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (bnc#1146516 bnc#1146512 bnc#1146514)
- CVE-2019-14835: A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Linux
kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs,
logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user
able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration
is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the
host (bnc#1150112).
- CVE-2019-15030: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local
user can read vector registers of other users' processes via a Facility
Unavailable exception. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts
a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin)
and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers
will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process
because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check (bnc#1149713).
- CVE-2019-15031: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local
user can read vector registers of other users' processes via an
interrupt. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a
transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin)
and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers
will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process,
because MSR\_TM\_ACTIVE is misused in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c
(bnc#1149713).
- CVE-2019-15090: In the qedi\_dbg\_\* family of functions, there was an
out-of-bounds read (bnc#1146399).
- CVE-2019-15098: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c in the Linux
kernel had a NULL pointer dereference via an incomplete address in an
endpoint descriptor (bnc#1146378 1146543).
- CVE-2019-15099: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/usb.c in the Linux
kernel had a NULL pointer dereference via an incomplete address in an
endpoint descriptor (bnc#1146368).
- CVE-2019-15117: parse\_audio\_mixer\_unit in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux
kernel mishandled a short descriptor, leading to out-of-bounds memory
access (bnc#1145920).
- CVE-2019-15118: check\_input\_term in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux
kernel mishandled recursion, leading to kernel stack exhaustion
(bnc#1145922).
- CVE-2019-15211: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-dev.c driver because
drivers/media/radio/radio-raremono.c did not properly allocate memory
(bnc#1146519).
- CVE-2019-15212: There was a double-free caused by a malicious USB device
in the drivers/usb/misc/rio500.c driver (bnc#1146391).
- CVE-2019-15214: There was a use-after-free in the sound subsystem
because card disconnection causes certain data structures to be deleted
too early. This is related to sound/core/init.c and sound/core/info.c
(bnc#1146550).
- CVE-2019-15215: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2\_usb.c driver (bnc#1146425).
- CVE-2019-15216: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c driver
(bnc#1146361).
- CVE-2019-15217: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/zr364xx/zr364xx.c driver
(bnc#1146547).
- CVE-2019-15218: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver
(bnc#1146413).
- CVE-2019-15219: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/sisusbvga/sisusb.c driver
(bnc#1146524).
- CVE-2019-15220: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/net/wireless/intersil/p54/p54usb.c driver
(bnc#1146526).
- CVE-2019-15221: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the sound/usb/line6/pcm.c driver (bnc#1146529).
- CVE-2019-15222: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the sound/usb/helper.c (motu\_microbookii) driver
(bnc#1146531).
- CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp\_output.c
change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly
backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new
vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was
intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write
queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can
trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel
crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. (for example) Linux
distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels or 4.14.x longterm kernels
(bnc#1146589)
- CVE-2019-15290: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the ath6kl\_usb\_alloc\_urb\_from\_pipe function in
the drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c driver (bnc#1146378 1146543).
- CVE-2019-15292: There was a use-after-free in atalk\_proc\_exit, related
to net/appletalk/atalk\_proc.c, net/appletalk/ddp.c, and
net/appletalk/sysctl\_net\_atalk.c (bnc#1146678).
- CVE-2019-15538: XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of
being out of disk quota. xfs\_setattr\_nonsize is failing to unlock the
ILOCK after the xfs\_qm\_vop\_chown\_reserve call fails. This is primarily a
local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if
the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS (bnc#1148093).
- CVE-2019-15666: There was an out-of-bounds array access in
\_\_xfrm\_policy\_unlink, which will cause denial of service, because
verify\_newpolicy\_info in net/xfrm/xfrm\_user.c mishandled directory
validation (bnc#1148394).
- CVE-2019-15902: Misuse of the upstream "x86/ptrace: Fix possible
spectre-v1 in ptrace\_get\_debugreg()" commit reintroduced the Spectre
vulnerability that it aimed to eliminate. This occurred because the
backport process depends on cherry picking specific commits, and because
two (correctly ordered) code lines were swapped (bnc#1149376).
- CVE-2019-15917: There was a use-after-free issue when
hci\_uart\_register\_dev() fails in hci\_uart\_set\_proto() in
drivers/bluetooth/hci\_ldisc.c (bnc#1149539).
- CVE-2019-15919: SMB2\_write in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free
(bnc#1149552).
- CVE-2019-15920: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel SMB2\_read in
fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free. NOTE: this was not fixed
correctly in 5.0.10; see the 5.0.11 ChangeLog, which documents a memory
leak (bnc#1149626).
- CVE-2019-15921: There was a memory leak issue when idr\_alloc() fails in
genl\_register\_family() in net/netlink/genetlink.c (bnc#1149602).
- CVE-2019-15924: fm10k\_init\_module in
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/fm10k/fm10k\_main.c had a NULL pointer
dereference because there is no -ENOMEM upon an alloc\_workqueue failure
(bnc#1149612).
- CVE-2019-15926: Out of bounds access exists in the functions
ath6kl\_wmi\_pstream\_timeout\_event\_rx and ath6kl\_wmi\_cac\_event\_rx in the
file drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c (bnc#1149527).
- CVE-2019-15927: An out-of-bounds access exists in the function
build\_audio\_procunit in the file sound/usb/mixer.c (bnc#1149522).
- CVE-2019-9456: In the USB monitor driver there is a possible OOB write
due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of
privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
not needed for exploitation (bnc#1150025).
