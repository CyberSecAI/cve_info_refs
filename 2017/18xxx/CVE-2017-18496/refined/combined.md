## FAQ

### How will the plugin work with the existing .htaccess file?

If the file exists and there is a Directive block in it, the plugin will add the settings of this block to the settings page and after saving the changes it will update only the Directive block in the existing .htaccess file.

### What should I do if the .htaccess file does not exist?

The plugin will store the settings in the database and add all the necessary conditions of the directive block to the settings of WordPress automatically.

### How will the plugin work if after saving the changes there will appear a .htaccess file in the root directory of the site?

The plugin will get the data of the Directive block from .htaccess file automatically regardless of the previously configured settings.

### What should I do if after making changes in the .htaccess file with the help of the plugin my site stops working?

The .htaccess is located in the site root. With your FTP program or via Сpanel go to the site root, open the .htaccess file and delete the necessary strings manually.

Please make use of the following information: <https://codex.wordpress.org/FTP_Clients>

### What is content theft (hotlinking), and how do I protect myself against it?

To find out about hotlinking and the ways you can prevent it, please check our [article dedicated to the topic](https://bestwebsoft.com/how-to-prevent-hotlinking). In this article, you will find all the necessary data that will give you a heads up and help you avoid hotlinking on your website.

### How can I update the list of IPs after updating the plugin to V1.7.2?

In Htaccess by BestWebSoft V1.7.2 we moved all IPs that have been added to .htaccess automatically via plugin`s interaction hooks to “automatically added” plugin options. Since this update, they won’t be stored in the database but in the “.htaccess” file only. This was made in order to reduce the size of the database.

If you use some plugins that interact with the Htaccess by BestWebSoft plugin (e.g. Limit Attempts or Limit Attempts Pro by BestWebSoft), please go the Htaccess settings page and make sure that all IPs from IP lists of this plugin have been moved to “Deny from (automatically added)” and “Allow from (automatically added)” correctly. If some IPs from that lists are still in the “Deny from” and “Allow from” options, please remove them manually and save changes.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

– The link to the page where the problem occurs

– The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.

– The version of your WordPress installation

– Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://bestwebsoft.com/documentation/admin-panel-issues/system-status/)
