Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2017-18922 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper decoding of certain WebSocket frames in `websockets.c` within LibVNCServer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is a heap-based buffer overflow caused by the incorrect decoding of WebSocket frames. This buffer overflow is pre-authentication, meaning it can occur before a user authenticates with the VNC server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By sending specially crafted WebSocket frames, an attacker can overwrite function pointers, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also be exploited to crash the LibVNCServer process leading to a denial of service.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity:** Successful exploitation could lead to a breach of data confidentiality and integrity due to the ability to potentially execute code or cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is primarily network-based. A remote attacker sends malicious WebSocket frames to a vulnerable LibVNCServer instance.
*  **Pre-authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered during the initial websocket handshake, not requiring prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable LibVNCServer instance.
*   **Crafting Malicious Websocket Frames:** The attacker must craft and send specially crafted websocket frames to trigger the buffer overflow.
* No Privileges Required: The attacker does not require prior privileges on the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in LibVNCServer versions prior to 0.9.12.
*   The issue was fixed upstream, and distributions were notified.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in multiple SUSE security advisories, with updates provided for various SUSE and openSUSE products.
*   Red Hat also tracked this vulnerability.
*   Siemens has also published a security advisory that identifies this vulnerability as one of many vulnerabilities present in their SIMATIC ITC products.
* CVSS scores from different sources range from 7.5 to 9.8, with both confidentiality, integrity, and availability being impacted.
