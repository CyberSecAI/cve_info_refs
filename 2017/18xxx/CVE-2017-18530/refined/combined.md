At first I was delighted when I found a plugin that allows you to rate reviews and immediately marks them out. But micro-markup doesn’t work at all, nothing happens.
In the setting, there is an enable / disable button and there is nothing else for the markup. All reference data are outdated and there is nothing about micro-markup.
I was first made happy and then upset.

The plugin is working as described. But bottom-line for a blog without a “real” requirement for registered users not very useful. There is no option to open the rating for all visitors what for a rating plugin would be a useful option. Therefor 5 starts for the functionality and 1 star for the flexibility in operation.
As I read in the support community the request to open rating for all users was placed already, but without success.

Just when I needed. It worked flawlessly with my theme to easily create a movie review site.
Feature request:
shortcode to display ‘average user rating’ as desired.
user can edit/change rating (as in IMDB)
