*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

= Mbed TLS 3.6.0 branch released 2024-03-28
API changes \* Remove `tls13\_` in mbedtls\_ssl\_tls13\_conf\_early\_data() and mbedtls\_ssl\_tls13\_conf\_max\_early\_data\_size() API names. Early data feature may not be TLS 1.3 specific in the future. Fixes #6909.
Default behavior changes \* psa\_import\_key() now only accepts RSA keys in the PSA standard formats. The undocumented ability to import other formats (PKCS#8, SubjectPublicKey, PEM) accepted by the pkparse module has been removed. Applications that need these formats can call mbedtls\_pk\_parse\_{public,}key() followed by mbedtls\_pk\_import\_into\_psa().
Requirement changes \* Drop support for Visual Studio 2013 and 2015, and Arm Compiler 5.
New deprecations \* Rename the MBEDTLS\_SHA256\_USE\_A64\_CRYPTO\_xxx config options to MBEDTLS\_SHA256\_USE\_ARMV8\_A\_CRYPTO\_xxx. The old names may still be used, but are deprecated. \* In the PSA API, domain parameters are no longer used for anything. They are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the library. \* mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_key() is deprecated in favor of mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_key\_ext().
Removals \* In the PSA API, the experimental way to encode the public exponent of an RSA key as a domain parameter is no longer supported. Use psa\_generate\_key\_ext() instead. \* Temporary function mbedtls\_pk\_wrap\_as\_opaque() is removed. To mimic the same behavior mbedtls\_pk\_get\_psa\_attributes() and mbedtls\_pk\_import\_into\_psa() can be used to import a PK key into PSA, while mbedtls\_pk\_setup\_opaque() can be used to wrap a PSA key into a opaque PK context.
Features \* Added an example program showing how to hash with the PSA API. \* Support Armv8-A Crypto Extension acceleration for SHA-256 when compiling for Thumb (T32) or 32-bit Arm (A32). \* AES-NI is now supported in Windows builds with clang and clang-cl. Resolves #8372. \* Add new mbedtls\_x509\_csr\_parse\_der\_with\_ext\_cb() routine which allows parsing unsupported certificate extensions via user provided callback. \* Enable the new option MBEDTLS\_BLOCK\_CIPHER\_NO\_DECRYPT to omit the decryption direction of block ciphers (AES, ARIA, Camellia). This affects both the low-level modules and the high-level APIs (the cipher and PSA interfaces). This option is incompatible with modes that use the decryption direction (ECB in PSA, CBC, XTS, KW) and with DES. \* Support use of Armv8-A Cryptographic Extensions for hardware acclerated AES when compiling for Thumb (T32) or 32-bit Arm (A32). \* If a cipher or AEAD mechanism has a PSA driver, you can now build the library without the corresponding built-in implementation. Generally speaking that requires both the key type and algorithm to be accelerated or they'll both be built in. However, for CCM and GCM the built-in implementation is able to take advantage of a driver that only accelerates the key type (that is, the block cipher primitive). See docs/driver-only-builds.md for full details and current limitations. \* The CTR\_DRBG module will now use AES from a PSA driver if MBEDTLS\_AES\_C is disabled. This requires PSA\_WANT\_ALG\_ECB\_NO\_PADDING in addition to MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C and PSA\_WANT\_KEY\_TYPE\_AES. \* Fewer modules depend on MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_C, making it possible to save code size by disabling it in more circumstances. In particular, the CCM and GCM modules no longer depend on MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_C. Also, MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO can now be enabled without MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_C if all unauthenticated (non-AEAD) ciphers are disabled, or if they're all fully provided by drivers. See docs/driver-only-builds.md for full details and current limitations; in particular, NIST\_KW and PKCS5/PKCS12 decryption still unconditionally depend on MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_C. \* Add support for record size limit extension as defined by RFC 8449 and configured with MBEDTLS\_SSL\_RECORD\_SIZE\_LIMIT. Application data sent and received will be fragmented according to Record size limits negotiated during handshake. \* Improve performance of AES-GCM, AES-CTR and CTR-DRBG when hardware accelerated AES is not present (around 13-23% on 64-bit Arm). \* Add functions mbedtls\_ecc\_group\_to\_psa() and mbedtls\_ecc\_group\_from\_psa() to convert between Mbed TLS and PSA curve identifiers. \* Add utility functions to manipulate mbedtls\_ecp\_keypair objects, filling gaps made by making its fields private: mbedtls\_ecp\_set\_public\_key(), mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_public\_key(), mbedtls\_ecp\_keypair\_calc\_public(), mbedtls\_ecp\_keypair\_get\_group\_id(). Fixes #5017, #5441, #8367, #8652. \* Add functions mbedtls\_md\_psa\_alg\_from\_type() and mbedtls\_md\_type\_from\_psa\_alg() to convert between mbedtls\_md\_type\_t and psa\_algorithm\_t. \* Add partial platform support for z/OS. \* Improve performance for gcc (versions older than 9.3.0) and IAR. \* Add functions mbedtls\_ecdsa\_raw\_to\_der() and mbedtls\_ecdsa\_der\_to\_raw() to convert ECDSA signatures between raw and DER (ASN.1) formats. \* Add support for using AES-CBC 128, 192, and 256 bit schemes with PKCS#5 PBES2. Keys encrypted this way can now be parsed by PK parse. \* The new function mbedtls\_rsa\_get\_bitlen() returns the length of the modulus in bits, i.e. the key size for an RSA key. \* Add pc files for pkg-config, e.g.: pkg-config --cflags --libs (mbedtls|mbedcrypto|mbedx509) \* Add getter (mbedtls\_ssl\_session\_get\_ticket\_creation\_time()) to access `mbedtls\_ssl\_session.ticket\_creation\_time`. \* The new functions mbedtls\_pk\_get\_psa\_attributes() and mbedtls\_pk\_import\_into\_psa() provide a uniform way to create a PSA key from a PK key. \* The benchmark program now reports times for both ephemeral and static ECDH in all ECDH configurations. \* Add support for 8-bit GCM tables for Shoup's algorithm to speedup GCM operations when hardware accelerated AES is not present. Improves performance by around 30% on 64-bit Intel; 125% on Armv7-M. \* The new function psa\_generate\_key\_ext() allows generating an RSA key pair with a custom public exponent. \* The new function mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_key\_ext() is similar to mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_key(), but can be used without separately calculating the output length. \* Add new accessor to expose the private group id member of `mbedtls\_ecdh\_context` structure. \* Add new accessor to expose the `MBEDTLS\_PRIVATE(ca\_istrue)` member of `mbedtls\_x509\_crt` structure. This requires setting the MBEDTLS\_X509\_EXT\_BASIC\_CONSTRAINTS bit in the certificate's ext\_types field. \* mbedtls\_psa\_get\_random() is always available as soon as MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_CLIENT is enabled at build time and psa\_crypto\_init() is called at runtime. This together with MBEDTLS\_PSA\_RANDOM\_STATE can be used as random number generator function (f\_rng) and context (p\_rng) in legacy functions. \* The new functions mbedtls\_pk\_copy\_from\_psa() and mbedtls\_pk\_copy\_public\_from\_psa() provide ways to set up a PK context with the same content as a PSA key. \* Add new accessors to expose the private session-id, session-id length, and ciphersuite-id members of `mbedtls\_ssl\_session` structure. Add new accessor to expose the ciphersuite-id of `mbedtls\_ssl\_ciphersuite\_t` structure.Design ref: #8529 \* Mbed TLS now supports the writing and reading of TLS 1.3 early data (see docs/tls13-early-data.md). The support enablement is controlled at build time by the MBEDTLS\_SSL\_EARLY\_DATA configuration option and at runtime by the mbedtls\_ssl\_conf\_early\_data() API (by default disabled in both cases). \* Add protection for multithreaded access to the PSA keystore and protection for multithreaded access to the the PSA global state, including concurrently calling psa\_crypto\_init() when MBEDTLS\_THREADING\_C and MBEDTLS\_THREADING\_PTHREAD are defined. See docs/architecture/psa-thread-safety/psa-thread-safety.md for more details. Resolves issues #3263 and #7945.
Security \* Fix a stack buffer overread (less than 256 bytes) when parsing a TLS 1.3 ClientHello in a TLS 1.3 server supporting some PSK key exchange mode. A malicious client could cause information disclosure or a denial of service. \* Passing buffers that are stored in untrusted memory as arguments to PSA functions is now secure by default. The PSA core now protects against modification of inputs or exposure of intermediate outputs during operations. This is currently implemented by copying buffers. This feature increases code size and memory usage. If buffers passed to PSA functions are owned exclusively by the PSA core for the duration of the function call (i.e. no buffer parameters are in shared memory), copying may be disabled by setting MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ASSUME\_EXCLUSIVE\_BUFFERS. Note that setting this option will cause input-output buffer overlap to be only partially supported (#3266). Fixes CVE-2024-28960. \* Restore the maximum TLS version to be negotiated to the configured one when an SSL context is reset with the mbedtls\_ssl\_session\_reset() API. An attacker was able to prevent an Mbed TLS server from establishing any TLS 1.3 connection potentially resulting in a Denial of Service or forced version downgrade from TLS 1.3 to TLS 1.2. Fixes #8654 reported by hey3e. Fixes CVE-2024-28755. \* When negotiating TLS version on server side, do not fall back to the TLS 1.2 implementation of the protocol if it is disabled. - If the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at build time, a TLS 1.2 client could put the TLS 1.3-only server in an infinite loop processing a TLS 1.2 ClientHello, resulting in a denial of service. Reported by Matthias Mucha and Thomas Blattmann, SICK AG. - If the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at runtime, a TLS 1.2 client was able to successfully establish a TLS 1.2 connection with the server. Reported by alluettiv on GitHub. Fixes CVE-2024-28836.
Bugfix \* Fix the build with CMake when Everest or P256-m is enabled through a user configuration file or the compiler command line. Fixes #8165. \* Fix compilation error in C++ programs when MBEDTLS\_ASN1\_PARSE\_C is disabled. \* Fix possible NULL dereference issue in X509 cert\_req program if an entry in the san parameter is not separated by a colon. \* Fix possible NULL dereference issue in X509 cert\_write program if an entry in the san parameter is not separated by a colon. \* Fix an inconsistency between implementations and usages of `\_\_cpuid`, which mainly causes failures when building Windows target using mingw or clang. Fixes #8334 & #8332. \* Fix build failure in conda-forge. Fixes #8422. \* Fix parsing of CSRs with critical extensions. \* Switch to milliseconds as the unit for ticket creation and reception time instead of seconds. That avoids rounding errors when computing the age of tickets compared to peer using a millisecond clock (observed with GnuTLS). Fixes #6623. \* Fix TLS server accepting TLS 1.2 handshake while TLS 1.2 is disabled at runtime. Fixes #8593. \* Remove accidental introduction of RSA signature algorithms in TLS Suite B Profile. Fixes #8221. \* Fix unsupported PSA asymmetric encryption and decryption (psa\_asymmetric\_[en|de]crypt) with opaque keys. Resolves #8461. \* On Linux on ARMv8, fix a build error with SHA-256 and SHA-512 acceleration detection when the libc headers do not define the corresponding constant. Reported by valord577. \* Correct initial capacities for key derivation algorithms:TLS12\_PRF, TLS12\_PSK\_TO\_MS, PBKDF2-HMAC, PBKDF2-CMAC \* Fix mbedtls\_pk\_get\_bitlen() for RSA keys whose size is not a multiple of 8. Fixes #868. \* Avoid segmentation fault caused by releasing not initialized entropy resource in gen\_key example. Fixes #8809. \* mbedtls\_pem\_read\_buffer() now performs a check on the padding data of decrypted keys and it rejects invalid ones. \* Fix mbedtls\_pk\_sign(), mbedtls\_pk\_verify(), mbedtls\_pk\_decrypt() and mbedtls\_pk\_encrypt() on non-opaque RSA keys to honor the padding mode in the RSA context. Before, if MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO was enabled and the RSA context was configured for PKCS#1 v2.1 (PSS/OAEP), the sign/verify functions performed a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature instead and the encrypt/decrypt functions returned an error. Fixes #8824. \* Fix missing bitflags in SSL session serialization headers. Their absence allowed SSL sessions saved in one configuration to be loaded in a different, incompatible configuration. \* In TLS 1.3 clients, fix an interoperability problem due to the client generating a new random after a HelloRetryRequest. Fixes #8669. \* Fix the restoration of the ALPN when loading serialized connection with the mbedtls\_ssl\_context\_load() API. \* Fix NULL pointer dereference in mbedtls\_pk\_verify\_ext() when called using an opaque RSA context and specifying MBEDTLS\_PK\_RSASSA\_PSS as key type. \* Fix RSA opaque keys always using PKCS1 v1.5 algorithms instead of the primary algorithm of the wrapped PSA key. \* Fully support arbitrary overlap between inputs and outputs of PSA functions. Note that overlap is still only partially supported when MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ASSUME\_EXCLUSIVE\_BUFFERS is set (#3266).
Changes \* Use heap memory to allocate DER encoded public/private key. This reduces stack usage significantly for writing a public/private key to a PEM string. \* PSA\_WANT\_ALG\_CCM and PSA\_WANT\_ALG\_CCM\_STAR\_NO\_TAG are no more synonyms and they are now treated separately. This means that they should be individually enabled in order to enable respective support; also the corresponding MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ACCEL symbol should be defined in case acceleration is required. \* Moved declaration of functions mbedtls\_ecc\_group\_to\_psa and mbedtls\_ecc\_group\_of\_psa from psa/crypto\_extra.h to mbedtls/psa\_util.h \* mbedtls\_pk\_sign\_ext() is now always available, not just when PSA (MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C) is enabled. \* Extended PSA Crypto configurations options for FFDH by making it possible to select only some of the parameters / groups, with the macros PSA\_WANT\_DH\_RFC7919\_XXXX. You now need to defined the corresponding macro for each size you want to support. Also, if you have an FFDH accelerator, you'll need to define the appropriate MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ACCEL macros to signal support for these domain parameters. \* RSA support in PSA no longer auto-enables the pkparse and pkwrite modules, saving code size when those are not otherwise enabled. \* mbedtls\_mpi\_exp\_mod and code that uses it, notably RSA and DHM operations, have changed their speed/memory compromise as part of a proactive security improvement. The new default value of MBEDTLS\_MPI\_WINDOW\_SIZE roughly preserves the current speed, at the expense of increasing memory consumption. \* Rename directory containing Visual Studio files from visualc/VS2013 to visualc/VS2017. \* The TLS 1.3 protocol is now enabled in the default configuration.
= Mbed TLS 3.5.2 branch released 2024-01-26
Security \* Fix a timing side channel in private key RSA operations. This side channel could be sufficient for an attacker to recover the plaintext. A local attacker or a remote attacker who is close to the victim on the network might have precise enough timing measurements to exploit this. It requires the attacker to send a large number of messages for decryption. For details, see "Everlasting ROBOT: the Marvin Attack", Hubert Kario. Reported by Hubert Kario, Red Hat. \* Fix a failure to validate input when writing x509 extensions lengths which could result in an integer overflow, causing a zero-length buffer to be allocated to hold the extension. The extension would then be copied into the buffer, causing a heap buffer overflow.
= Mbed TLS 3.5.1 branch released 2023-11-06
Changes \* Mbed TLS is now released under a dual Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later license. Users may choose which license they take the code under.
Bugfix \* Fix accidental omission of MBEDTLS\_TARGET\_PREFIX in 3rdparty modules in CMake.
= Mbed TLS 3.5.0 branch released 2023-10-05
API changes \* Mbed TLS 3.4 introduced support for omitting the built-in implementation of ECDSA and/or EC J-PAKE when those are provided by a driver. However, there was a flaw in the logic checking if the built-in implementation, in that it failed to check if all the relevant curves were supported by the accelerator. As a result, it was possible to declare no curves as accelerated and still have the built-in implementation compiled out. Starting with this release, it is necessary to declare which curves are accelerated (using MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ACCEL\_ECC\_xxx macros), or they will be considered not accelerated, and the built-in implementation of the curves and any algorithm possible using them will be included in the build. \* Add new millisecond time type `mbedtls\_ms\_time\_t` and `mbedtls\_ms\_time()` function, needed for TLS 1.3 ticket lifetimes. Alternative implementations can be created using an ALT interface.
Requirement changes \* Officially require Python 3.8 now that earlier versions are out of support. \* Minimum required Windows version is now Windows Vista, or Windows Server 2008.
New deprecations \* PSA\_WANT\_KEY\_TYPE\_xxx\_KEY\_PAIR and MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ACCEL\_KEY\_TYPE\_xxx\_KEY\_PAIR, where xxx is either ECC or RSA, are now being deprecated in favor of PSA\_WANT\_KEY\_TYPE\_xxx\_KEY\_PAIR\_yyy and MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ACCEL\_KEY\_TYPE\_xxx\_KEY\_PAIR\_yyy. Here yyy can be: BASIC, IMPORT, EXPORT, GENERATE, DERIVE. The goal is to have a finer detail about the capabilities of the PSA side for either key. \* MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_BLKSIZE\_MAX is deprecated in favor of MBEDTLS\_MAX\_BLOCK\_LENGTH (if you intended what the name suggests: maximum size of any supported block cipher) or the new name MBEDTLS\_CMAC\_MAX\_BLOCK\_SIZE (if you intended the actual semantics: maximum size of a block cipher supported by the CMAC module). \* mbedtls\_pkcs5\_pbes2() and mbedtls\_pkcs12\_pbe() functions are now deprecated in favor of mbedtls\_pkcs5\_pbes2\_ext() and mbedtls\_pkcs12\_pbe\_ext() as they offer more security by checking for overflow of the output buffer and reporting the actual length of the output.
Features \* All modules that use hashes or HMAC can now take advantage of PSA Crypto drivers when MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C is enabled and psa\_crypto\_init() has been called. Previously (in 3.3), this was restricted to a few modules, and only in builds where MBEDTLS\_MD\_C was disabled; in particular the entropy module was not covered which meant an external RNG had to be provided - these limitations are lifted in this version. A new set of feature macros, MBEDTLS\_MD\_CAN\_xxx, has been introduced that can be used to check for availability of hash algorithms, regardless of whether they're provided by a built-in implementation, a driver or both. See docs/driver-only-builds.md. \* When a PSA driver for ECDH is present, it is now possible to disable MBEDTLS\_ECDH\_C in the build in order to save code size. For TLS 1.2 key exchanges based on ECDH(E) to work, this requires MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO. Restartable/interruptible ECDHE operations in TLS 1.2 (ECDHE-ECDSA key exchange) are not supported in those builds yet, as PSA does not have an API for restartable ECDH yet. \* When all of ECDH, ECDSA and EC J-PAKE are either disabled or provided by a driver, it is possible to disable MBEDTLS\_ECP\_C (and MBEDTLS\_BIGNUM\_C if not required by another module) and still get support for ECC keys and algorithms in PSA, with some limitations. See docs/driver-only-builds.txt for details. \* Add parsing of directoryName subtype for subjectAltName extension in x509 certificates. \* Add support for server-side TLS version negotiation. If both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 protocols are enabled, the TLS server now selects TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 depending on the capabilities and preferences of TLS clients. Fixes #6867. \* X.509 hostname verification now supports IPAddress Subject Alternate Names. \* Add support for reading and writing X25519 and X448 public and private keys in RFC 8410 format using the existing PK APIs. \* When parsing X.509 certificates, support the extensions SignatureKeyIdentifier and AuthorityKeyIdentifier. \* Don't include the PSA dispatch functions for PAKEs (psa\_pake\_setup() etc) if no PAKE algorithms are requested \* Add support for the FFDH algorithm and DH key types in PSA, with parameters from RFC 7919. This includes a built-in implementation based on MBEDTLS\_BIGNUM\_C, and a driver dispatch layer enabling alternative implementations of FFDH through the driver entry points. \* It is now possible to generate certificates with SubjectAltNames. Currently supported subtypes: DnsName, UniformResourceIdentifier, IP address, OtherName, and DirectoryName, as defined in RFC 5280. See mbedtls\_x509write\_crt\_set\_subject\_alternative\_name for more information. \* X.509 hostname verification now partially supports URI Subject Alternate Names. Only exact matching, without any normalization procedures described in 7.4 of RFC5280, will result in a positive URI verification. \* Add function mbedtls\_oid\_from\_numeric\_string() to parse an OID from a string to a DER-encoded mbedtls\_asn1\_buf. \* Add SHA-3 family hash functions. \* Add support to restrict AES to 128-bit keys in order to save code size. A new configuration option, MBEDTLS\_AES\_ONLY\_128\_BIT\_KEY\_LENGTH, can be used to enable this feature. \* AES performance improvements. Uplift varies by platform, toolchain, optimisation flags and mode. Aarch64, gcc -Os and CCM, GCM and XTS benefit the most. On Aarch64, uplift is typically around 20 - 110%. When compiling with gcc -Os on Aarch64, AES-XTS improves by 4.5x. \* Add support for PBKDF2-HMAC through the PSA API. \* New symbols PSA\_WANT\_KEY\_TYPE\_xxx\_KEY\_PAIR\_yyy and MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ACCEL\_KEY\_TYPE\_xxx\_KEY\_PAIR\_yyy (where xxx is either ECC, RSA or DH) were introduced in order to have finer accuracy in defining the PSA capabilities for each key. These capabilities, named yyy above, can be any of: BASIC, IMPORT, EXPORT, GENERATE, DERIVE. - DERIVE is only available for ECC keys, not for RSA or DH ones. - implementations are free to enable more than what it was strictly requested. For example BASIC internally enables IMPORT and EXPORT (useful for testing purposes), but this might change in the future. \* Add support for FFDH key exchange in TLS 1.3. This is automatically enabled as soon as PSA\_WANT\_ALG\_FFDH and the ephemeral or psk-ephemeral key exchange mode are enabled. By default, all groups are offered; the list of groups can be configured using the existing API function mbedtls\_ssl\_conf\_groups(). \* Improve mbedtls\_x509\_time performance and reduce memory use. \* Reduce syscalls to time() during certificate verification. \* Allow MBEDTLS\_CONFIG\_FILE and MBEDTLS\_USER\_CONFIG\_FILE to be set by setting the CMake variable of the same name at configuration time. \* Add getter (mbedtls\_ssl\_cache\_get\_timeout()) to access `mbedtls\_ssl\_cache\_context.timeout`. \* Add getter (mbedtls\_ssl\_get\_hostname()) to access `mbedtls\_ssl\_context.hostname`. \* Add getter (mbedtls\_ssl\_conf\_get\_endpoint()) to access `mbedtls\_ssl\_config.endpoint`. \* Support for "opaque" (PSA-held) ECC keys in the PK module has been extended: it is now possible to use mbedtls\_pk\_write\_key\_der(), mbedtls\_pk\_write\_key\_pem(), mbedtls\_pk\_check\_pair(), and mbedtls\_pk\_verify() with opaque ECC keys (provided the PSA attributes allow it). \* The documentation of mbedtls\_ecp\_group now describes the optimized representation of A for some curves. Fixes #8045. \* Add a possibility to generate CSR's with RCF822 and directoryName subtype of subjectAltName extension in x509 certificates. \* Add support for PBKDF2-CMAC through the PSA API. \* New configuration option MBEDTLS\_AES\_USE\_HARDWARE\_ONLY introduced. When using CPU-accelerated AES (e.g., Arm Crypto Extensions), this option disables the plain C implementation and the run-time detection for the CPU feature, which reduces code size and avoids the vulnerability of the plain C implementation. \* Accept arbitrary AttributeType and AttributeValue in certificate Distinguished Names using RFC 4514 syntax. \* Applications using ECC over secp256r1 through the PSA API can use a new implementation with a much smaller footprint, but some minor usage restrictions. See the documentation of the new configuration option MBEDTLS\_PSA\_P256M\_DRIVER\_ENABLED for details.
Security \* Fix a case where potentially sensitive information held in memory would not be completely zeroized during TLS 1.2 handshake, in both server and client configurations. \* In configurations with ARIA or Camellia but not AES, the value of MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_BLKSIZE\_MAX was 8, rather than 16 as the name might suggest. This did not affect any library code, because this macro was only used in relation with CMAC which does not support these ciphers. This may affect application code that uses this macro. \* Developers using mbedtls\_pkcs5\_pbes2() or mbedtls\_pkcs12\_pbe() should review the size of the output buffer passed to this function, and note that the output after decryption may include CBC padding. Consider moving to the new functions mbedtls\_pkcs5\_pbes2\_ext() or mbedtls\_pkcs12\_pbe\_ext() which checks for overflow of the output buffer and reports the actual length of the output. \* Improve padding calculations in CBC decryption, NIST key unwrapping and RSA OAEP decryption. With the previous implementation, some compilers (notably recent versions of Clang and IAR) could produce non-constant time code, which could allow a padding oracle attack if the attacker has access to precise timing measurements. \* Updates to constant-time C code so that compilers are less likely to use conditional instructions, which can have an observable difference in timing. (Clang has been seen to do this.) Also introduce assembly implementations for 32- and 64-bit Arm and for x86 and x86-64, which are guaranteed not to use conditional instructions. \* Fix definition of MBEDTLS\_MD\_MAX\_BLOCK\_SIZE, which was too small when MBEDTLS\_SHA384\_C was defined and MBEDTLS\_SHA512\_C was undefined. Mbed TLS itself was unaffected by this, but user code which used MBEDTLS\_MD\_MAX\_BLOCK\_SIZE could be affected. The only release containing this bug was Mbed TLS 3.4.0. \* Fix a buffer overread when parsing short TLS application data records in null-cipher cipher suites. Credit to OSS-Fuzz. \* Fix a remotely exploitable heap buffer overflow in TLS handshake parsing. In TLS 1.3, all configurations are affected except PSK-only ones, and both clients and servers are affected. In TLS 1.2, the affected configurations are those with MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO and ECDH enabled but DHM and RSA disabled, and only servers are affected, not clients. Credit to OSS-Fuzz.
Bugfix \* Fix proper sizing for PSA\_EXPORT\_[KEY\_PAIR/PUBLIC\_KEY]\_MAX\_SIZE and PSA\_SIGNATURE\_MAX\_SIZE buffers when at least one accelerated EC is bigger than all built-in ones and RSA is disabled. Resolves #6622. \* Add missing md.h includes to some of the external programs from the programs directory. Without this, even though the configuration was sufficient for a particular program to work, it would only print a message that one of the required defines is missing. \* Fix declaration of mbedtls\_ecdsa\_sign\_det\_restartable() function in the ecdsa.h header file. There was a build warning when the configuration macro MBEDTLS\_ECDSA\_SIGN\_ALT was defined. Resolves #7407. \* Fix an error when MBEDTLS\_ECDSA\_SIGN\_ALT is defined but not MBEDTLS\_ECDSA\_VERIFY\_ALT, causing ecdsa verify to fail. Fixes #7498. \* Fix missing PSA initialization in sample programs when MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO is enabled. \* Fix the J-PAKE driver interface for user and peer to accept any values (previously accepted values were limited to "client" or "server"). \* Fix clang and armclang compilation error when targeting certain Arm M-class CPUs (Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M1, Cortex-M23, SecurCore SC000). Fixes #1077. \* Fix "unterminated '#pragma clang attribute push'" in sha256/sha512.c when built with MBEDTLS\_SHAxxx\_USE\_A64\_CRYPTO\_IF\_PRESENT but don't have a way to detect the crypto extensions required. A warning is still issued. \* Fixed an issue that caused compile errors when using CMake and the IAR toolchain. \* Fix very high stack usage in SSL debug code. Reported by Maximilian Gerhardt in #7804. \* Fix a compilation failure in the constant\_time module when building for arm64\_32 (e.g., for watchos). Reported by Paulo Coutinho in #7787. \* Fix crypt\_and\_hash decryption fail when used with a stream cipher mode of operation due to the input not being multiple of block size. Resolves #7417. \* Fix a bug in which mbedtls\_x509\_string\_to\_names() would return success when given a invalid name string if it did not contain '=' or ','. \* Fix compilation warnings in aes.c, which prevented the example TF-M configuration in configs/ from building cleanly: tfm\_mbedcrypto\_config\_profile\_medium.h with crypto\_config\_profile\_medium.h. \* In TLS 1.3, fix handshake failure when a client in its ClientHello proposes an handshake based on PSK only key exchange mode or at least one of the key exchange modes using ephemeral keys to a server that supports only the PSK key exchange mode. \* Fix CCM\* with no tag being not supported in a build with CCM as the only symmetric encryption algorithm and the PSA configuration enabled. \* Fix the build with MBEDTLS\_PSA\_INJECT\_ENTROPY. Fixes #7516. \* Fix a compilation error on some platforms when including mbedtls/ssl.h with all TLS support disabled. Fixes #6628. \* Fix x509 certificate generation to conform to RFC 5480 / RFC 5758 when using ECC key. The certificate was rejected by some crypto frameworks. Fixes #2924. \* Fix a potential corruption of the passed-in IV when mbedtls\_aes\_crypt\_cbc() is called with zero length and padlock is not enabled. \* Fix compile failure due to empty enum in cipher\_wrap.c, when building with a very minimal configuration. Fixes #7625. \* Fix some cases where mbedtls\_mpi\_mod\_exp, RSA key construction or ECDSA signature can silently return an incorrect result in low memory conditions. \* Don't try to include MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_USER\_CONFIG\_FILE when MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_CONFIG is disabled. \* Fix IAR compiler warnings. \* Fix an issue when parsing an otherName subject alternative name into a mbedtls\_x509\_san\_other\_name struct. The type-id of the otherName was not copied to the struct. This meant that the struct had incomplete information about the otherName SAN and contained uninitialized memory. \* Fix the detection of HardwareModuleName otherName SANs. These were being detected by comparing the wrong field and the check was erroneously inverted. \* Fix a build error in some configurations with MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_CONFIG enabled, where some low-level modules required by requested PSA crypto features were not getting automatically enabled. Fixes #7420. \* Fix undefined symbols in some builds using TLS 1.3 with a custom configuration file. \* Fix log level for the got supported group message. Fixes #6765 \* Functions in the ssl\_cache module now return a negative MBEDTLS\_ERR\_xxx error code on failure. Before, they returned 1 to indicate failure in some cases involving a missing entry or a full cache. \* mbedtls\_pk\_parse\_key() now rejects trailing garbage in encrypted keys. \* Fix the build with CMake when Everest or P256-m is enabled through a user configuration file or the compiler command line. Fixes #8165.
Changes \* Enable Arm / Thumb bignum assembly for most Arm platforms when compiling with gcc, clang or armclang and -O0. \* Enforce minimum RSA key size when generating a key to avoid accidental misuse. \* Use heap memory to allocate DER encoded RSA private key. This reduces stack usage significantly for RSA signature operations when MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C is defined. \* Update Windows code to use BCryptGenRandom and wcslen, and ensure that conversions between size\_t, ULONG, and int are always done safely. Original contribution by Kevin Kane #635, #730 followed by Simon Butcher #1453. \* Users integrating their own PSA drivers should be aware that the file library/psa\_crypto\_driver\_wrappers.c has been renamed to psa\_crypto\_driver\_wrappers\_no\_static.c. \* When using CBC with the cipher module, the requirement to call mbedtls\_cipher\_set\_padding\_mode() is now enforced. Previously, omitting this call accidentally applied a default padding mode chosen at compile time.
= Mbed TLS 3.4.1 branch released 2023-08-04
Bugfix \* Fix builds on Windows with clang
Changes \* Update test data to avoid failures of unit tests after 2023-08-07.
= Mbed TLS 3.4.0 branch released 2023-03-28
Default behavior changes \* The default priority order of TLS 1.3 cipher suites has been modified to follow the same rules as the TLS 1.2 cipher suites (see ssl\_ciphersuites.c). The preferred cipher suite is now TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256.
New deprecations \* mbedtls\_x509write\_crt\_set\_serial() is now being deprecated in favor of mbedtls\_x509write\_crt\_set\_serial\_raw(). The goal here is to remove any direct dependency of X509 on BIGNUM\_C. \* PSA to mbedtls error translation is now unified in psa\_util.h, deprecating mbedtls\_md\_error\_from\_psa. Each file that performs error translation should define its own version of PSA\_TO\_MBEDTLS\_ERR, optionally providing file-specific error pairs. Please see psa\_util.h for more details.
Features \* Added partial support for parsing the PKCS #7 Cryptographic Message Syntax, as defined in RFC 2315. Currently, support is limited to the following: - Only the signed-data content type, version 1 is supported. - Only DER encoding is supported. - Only a single digest algorithm per message is supported. - Certificates must be in X.509 format. A message must have either 0 or 1 certificates. - There is no support for certificate revocation lists. - The authenticated and unauthenticated attribute fields of SignerInfo must be empty. Many thanks to Daniel Axtens, Nayna Jain, and Nick Child from IBM for contributing this feature, and to Demi-Marie Obenour for contributing various improvements, tests and bug fixes. \* General performance improvements by accessing multiple bytes at a time. Fixes #1666. \* Improvements to use of unaligned and byte-swapped memory, reducing code size and improving performance (depending on compiler and target architecture). \* Add support for reading points in compressed format (MBEDTLS\_ECP\_PF\_COMPRESSED) with mbedtls\_ecp\_point\_read\_binary() (and callers) for Short Weierstrass curves with prime p where p = 3 mod 4 (all mbedtls MBEDTLS\_ECP\_DP\_SECP\* and MBEDTLS\_ECP\_DP\_BP\* curves except MBEDTLS\_ECP\_DP\_SECP224R1 and MBEDTLS\_ECP\_DP\_SECP224K1) \* SHA224\_C/SHA384\_C are now independent from SHA384\_C/SHA512\_C respectively. This helps in saving code size when some of the above hashes are not required. \* Add parsing of V3 extensions (key usage, Netscape cert-type, Subject Alternative Names) in x509 Certificate Sign Requests. \* Use HOSTCC (if it is set) when compiling C code during generation of the configuration-independent files. This allows them to be generated when CC is set for cross compilation. \* Add parsing of uniformResourceIdentifier subtype for subjectAltName extension in x509 certificates. \* Add an interruptible version of sign and verify hash to the PSA interface, backed by internal library support for ECDSA signing and verification. \* Add parsing of rfc822Name subtype for subjectAltName extension in x509 certificates. \* The configuration macros MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_PLATFORM\_FILE and MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_STRUCT\_FILE specify alternative locations for the headers "psa/crypto\_platform.h" and "psa/crypto\_struct.h". \* When a PSA driver for ECDSA is present, it is now possible to disable MBEDTLS\_ECDSA\_C in the build in order to save code size. For PK, X.509 and TLS to fully work, this requires MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO to be enabled. Restartable/interruptible ECDSA operations in PK, X.509 and TLS are not supported in those builds yet, as driver support for interruptible ECDSA operations is not present yet. \* Add a driver dispatch layer for EC J-PAKE, enabling alternative implementations of EC J-PAKE through the driver entry points. \* Add new API mbedtls\_ssl\_cache\_remove for cache entry removal by its session id. \* Add support to include the SubjectAltName extension to a CSR. \* Add support for AES with the Armv8-A Cryptographic Extension on 64-bit Arm. A new configuration option, MBEDTLS\_AESCE\_C, can be used to enable this feature. Run-time detection is supported under Linux only. \* When a PSA driver for EC J-PAKE is present, it is now possible to disable MBEDTLS\_ECJPAKE\_C in the build in order to save code size. For the corresponding TLS 1.2 key exchange to work, MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO needs to be enabled. \* Add functions mbedtls\_rsa\_get\_padding\_mode() and mbedtls\_rsa\_get\_md\_alg() to read non-public fields for padding mode and hash id from an mbedtls\_rsa\_context, as requested in #6917. \* AES-NI is now supported with Visual Studio. \* AES-NI is now supported in 32-bit builds, or when MBEDTLS\_HAVE\_ASM is disabled, when compiling with GCC or Clang or a compatible compiler for a target CPU that supports the requisite instructions (for example gcc -m32 -msse2 -maes -mpclmul). (Generic x86 builds with GCC-like compilers still require MBEDTLS\_HAVE\_ASM and a 64-bit target.) \* It is now possible to use a PSA-held (opaque) password with the TLS 1.2 ECJPAKE key exchange, using the new API function mbedtls\_ssl\_set\_hs\_ecjpake\_password\_opaque().
Security \* Use platform-provided secure zeroization function where possible, such as explicit\_bzero(). \* Zeroize SSL cache entries when they are freed. \* Fix a potential heap buffer overread in TLS 1.3 client-side when MBEDTLS\_DEBUG\_C is enabled. This may result in an application crash. \* Add support for AES with the Armv8-A Cryptographic Extension on 64-bit Arm, so that these systems are no longer vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks. This is configured by MBEDTLS\_AESCE\_C, which is on by default. Reported by Demi Marie Obenour. \* MBEDTLS\_AESNI\_C, which is enabled by default, was silently ignored on builds that couldn't compile the GCC-style assembly implementation (most notably builds with Visual Studio), leaving them vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks. There is now an intrinsics-based AES-NI implementation as a fallback for when the assembly one cannot be used.
Bugfix \* Fix possible integer overflow in mbedtls\_timing\_hardclock(), which could cause a crash in programs/test/benchmark. \* Fix IAR compiler warnings. Fixes #6924. \* Fix a bug in the build where directory names containing spaces were causing generate\_errors.pl to error out resulting in a build failure. Fixes issue #6879. \* In TLS 1.3, when using a ticket for session resumption, tweak its age calculation on the client side. It prevents a server with more accurate ticket timestamps (typically timestamps in milliseconds) compared to the Mbed TLS ticket timestamps (in seconds) to compute a ticket age smaller than the age computed and transmitted by the client and thus potentially reject the ticket. Fix #6623. \* Fix compile error where MBEDTLS\_RSA\_C and MBEDTLS\_X509\_CRT\_WRITE\_C are defined, but MBEDTLS\_PK\_RSA\_ALT\_SUPPORT is not defined. Fixes #3174. \* List PSA\_WANT\_ALG\_CCM\_STAR\_NO\_TAG in psa/crypto\_config.h so that it can be toggled with config.py. \* The key derivation algorithm PSA\_ALG\_TLS12\_ECJPAKE\_TO\_PMS cannot be used on a shared secret from a key agreement since its input must be an ECC public key. Reject this properly. \* mbedtls\_x509write\_crt\_set\_serial() now explicitly rejects serial numbers whose binary representation is longer than 20 bytes. This was already forbidden by the standard (RFC5280 - section 4.1.2.2) and now it's being enforced also at code level. \* Fix potential undefined behavior in mbedtls\_mpi\_sub\_abs(). Reported by Pascal Cuoq using TrustInSoft Analyzer in #6701; observed independently by Aaron Ucko under Valgrind. \* Fix behavior of certain sample programs which could, when run with no arguments, access uninitialized memory in some cases. Fixes #6700 (which was found by TrustInSoft Analyzer during REDOCS'22) and #1120. \* Fix parsing of X.509 SubjectAlternativeName extension. Previously, malformed alternative name components were not caught during initial certificate parsing, but only on subsequent calls to mbedtls\_x509\_parse\_subject\_alt\_name(). Fixes #2838. \* Make the fields of mbedtls\_pk\_rsassa\_pss\_options public. This makes it possible to verify RSA PSS signatures with the pk module, which was inadvertently broken since Mbed TLS 3.0. \* Fix bug in conversion from OID to string in mbedtls\_oid\_get\_numeric\_string(). OIDs such as 2.40.0.25 are now printed correctly. \* Reject OIDs with overlong-encoded subidentifiers when converting them to a string. \* Reject OIDs with subidentifier values exceeding UINT\_MAX. Such subidentifiers can be valid, but Mbed TLS cannot currently handle them. \* Reject OIDs that have unterminated subidentifiers, or (equivalently) have the most-significant bit set in their last byte. \* Silence warnings from clang -Wdocumentation about empty \retval descriptions, which started appearing with Clang 15. Fixes #6960. \* Fix the handling of renegotiation attempts in TLS 1.3. They are now systematically rejected. \* Fix an unused-variable warning in TLS 1.3-only builds if MBEDTLS\_SSL\_RENEGOTIATION was enabled. Fixes #6200. \* Fix undefined behavior in mbedtls\_ssl\_read() and mbedtls\_ssl\_write() if len argument is 0 and buffer is NULL. \* Allow setting user and peer identifiers for EC J-PAKE operation instead of role in PAKE PSA Crypto API as described in the specification. This is a partial fix that allows only "client" and "server" identifiers. \* Fix a compilation error when PSA Crypto is built with support for TLS12\_PRF but not TLS12\_PSK\_TO\_MS. Reported by joerchan in #7125. \* In the TLS 1.3 server, select the preferred client cipher suite, not the least preferred. The selection error was introduced in Mbed TLS 3.3.0. \* Fix TLS 1.3 session resumption when the established pre-shared key is 384 bits long. That is the length of pre-shared keys created under a session where the cipher suite is TLS\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384. \* Fix an issue when compiling with MBEDTLS\_SHA512\_USE\_A64\_CRYPTO\_IF\_PRESENT enabled, which required specifying compiler flags enabling SHA3 Crypto Extensions, where some compilers would emit EOR3 instructions in other modules, which would then fail if run on a CPU without the SHA3 extensions. Fixes #5758.
Changes \* Install the .cmake files into CMAKE\_INSTALL\_LIBDIR/cmake/MbedTLS, typically /usr/lib/cmake/MbedTLS. \* Mixed-endian systems are explicitly not supported any more. \* When MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO and MBEDTLS\_ECDSA\_DETERMINISTIC are both defined, mbedtls\_pk\_sign() now use deterministic ECDSA for ECDSA signatures. This aligns the behaviour with MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO to the behaviour without it, where deterministic ECDSA was already used. \* Visual Studio: Rename the directory containing Visual Studio files from visualc/VS2010 to visualc/VS2013 as we do not support building with versions older than 2013. Update the solution file to specify VS2013 as a minimum. \* programs/x509/cert\_write: - now it accepts the serial number in 2 different formats: decimal and hex. They cannot be used simultaneously - "serial" is used for the decimal format and it's limted in size to unsigned long long int - "serial\_hex" is used for the hex format; max length here is MBEDTLS\_X509\_RFC5280\_MAX\_SERIAL\_LEN\*2 \* The C code follows a new coding style. This is transparent for users but affects contributors and maintainers of local patches. For more information, see https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kb/how-to/rewrite-branch-for-coding-style/ \* Changed the default MBEDTLS\_ECP\_WINDOW\_SIZE from 6 to 2. As tested in issue 6790, the correlation between this define and RSA decryption performance has changed lately due to security fixes. To fix the performance degradation when using default values the window was reduced from 6 to 2, a value that gives the best or close to best results when tested on Cortex-M4 and Intel i7. \* When enabling MBEDTLS\_SHA256\_USE\_A64\_CRYPTO\_\* or MBEDTLS\_SHA512\_USE\_A64\_CRYPTO\_\*, it is no longer necessary to specify compiler target flags on the command line; the library now sets target options within the appropriate modules.
= Mbed TLS 3.3.0 branch released 2022-12-14
Default behavior changes \* Previously the macro MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID implemented version 05 of the IETF draft, and was marked experimental and disabled by default. It is now no longer experimental, and implements the final version from RFC 9146, which is not interoperable with the draft-05 version. If you need to communicate with peers that use earlier versions of Mbed TLS, then you need to define MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID\_COMPAT to 1, but then you won't be able to communicate with peers that use the standard (non-draft) version. If you need to interoperate with both classes of peers with the same build of Mbed TLS, please let us know about your situation on the mailing list or GitHub.
Requirement changes \* When building with PSA drivers using generate\_driver\_wrappers.py, or when building the library from the development branch rather than from a release, the Python module jsonschema is now necessary, in addition to jinja2. The official list of required Python modules is maintained in scripts/basic.requirements.txt and may change again in the future.
New deprecations \* Deprecate mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data(). Use mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data\_list() or mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data\_list\_shallow().
Features \* Support rsa\_pss\_rsae\_\* signature algorithms in TLS 1.2. \* make: enable building unversioned shared library, with e.g.: "SHARED=1 SOEXT\_TLS=so SOEXT\_X509=so SOEXT\_CRYPTO=so make lib" resulting in library names like "libmbedtls.so" rather than "libmbedcrypto.so.11". \* Expose the EC J-PAKE functionality through the Draft PSA PAKE Crypto API. Only the ECC primitive with secp256r1 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm are supported in this implementation. \* Some modules can now use PSA drivers for hashes, including with no built-in implementation present, but only in some configurations. - RSA OAEP and PSS (PKCS#1 v2.1), PKCS5, PKCS12 and EC J-PAKE now use hashes from PSA when (and only when) MBEDTLS\_MD\_C is disabled. - PEM parsing of encrypted files now uses MD-5 from PSA when (and only when) MBEDTLS\_MD5\_C is disabled. See the documentation of the corresponding macros in mbedtls\_config.h for details. Note that some modules are not able to use hashes from PSA yet, including the entropy module. As a consequence, for now the only way to build with all hashes only provided by drivers (no built-in hash) is to use MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_EXTERNAL\_RNG. \* When MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO is enabled, X.509, TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 now properly negotiate/accept hashes based on their availability in PSA. As a consequence, they now work in configurations where the built-in implementations of (some) hashes are excluded and those hashes are only provided by PSA drivers. (See previous entry for limitation on RSA-PSS though: that module only use hashes from PSA when MBEDTLS\_MD\_C is off). \* Add support for opaque keys as the private keys associated to certificates for authentication in TLS 1.3. \* Add the LMS post-quantum-safe stateful-hash asymmetric signature scheme. Signature verification is production-ready, but generation is for testing purposes only. This currently only supports one parameter set (LMS\_SHA256\_M32\_H10), meaning that each private key can be used to sign 1024 messages. As such, it is not intended for use in TLS, but instead for verification of assets transmitted over an insecure channel, particularly firmware images. \* Add the LM-OTS post-quantum-safe one-time signature scheme, which is required for LMS. This can be used independently, but each key can only be used to sign one message so is impractical for most circumstances. \* Mbed TLS now supports TLS 1.3 key establishment via pre-shared keys. The pre-shared keys can be provisioned externally or via the ticket mechanism (session resumption). The ticket mechanism is supported when the configuration option MBEDTLS\_SSL\_SESSION\_TICKETS is enabled. New options MBEDTLS\_SSL\_TLS1\_3\_KEY\_EXCHANGE\_MODE\_xxx\_ENABLED control the support for the three possible TLS 1.3 key exchange modes. \* cert\_write: support for setting extended key usage attributes. A corresponding new public API call has been added in the library, mbedtls\_x509write\_crt\_set\_ext\_key\_usage(). \* cert\_write: support for writing certificate files in either PEM or DER format. \* The PSA driver wrapper generator generate\_driver\_wrappers.py now supports a subset of the driver description language, including the following entry points: import\_key, export\_key, export\_public\_key, get\_builtin\_key, copy\_key. \* The new functions mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data\_list() and mbedtls\_asn1\_free\_named\_data\_list\_shallow() simplify the management of memory in named data lists in X.509 structures. \* The TLS 1.2 EC J-PAKE key exchange can now use the PSA Crypto API. Additional PSA key slots will be allocated in the process of such key exchange for builds that enable MBEDTLS\_KEY\_EXCHANGE\_ECJPAKE\_ENABLED and MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO. \* Add support for DTLS Connection ID as defined by RFC 9146, controlled by MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID (enabled by default) and configured with mbedtls\_ssl\_set\_cid(). \* Add a driver dispatch layer for raw key agreement, enabling alternative implementations of raw key agreement through the key\_agreement driver entry point. This entry point is specified in the proposed PSA driver interface, but had not yet been implemented. \* Add an ad-hoc key derivation function handling EC J-PAKE to PMS calculation that can be used to derive the session secret in TLS 1.2, as described in draft-cragie-tls-ecjpake-01. This can be achieved by using PSA\_ALG\_TLS12\_ECJPAKE\_TO\_PMS as the key derivation algorithm.
Security \* Fix potential heap buffer overread and overwrite in DTLS if MBEDTLS\_SSL\_DTLS\_CONNECTION\_ID is enabled and MBEDTLS\_SSL\_CID\_IN\_LEN\_MAX > 2 \* MBEDTLS\_SSL\_CID\_OUT\_LEN\_MAX. \* Fix an issue where an adversary with access to precise enough information about memory accesses (typically, an untrusted operating system attacking a secure enclave) could recover an RSA private key after observing the victim performing a single private-key operation if the window size used for the exponentiation was 3 or smaller. Found and reported by Zili KOU, Wenjian HE, Sharad Sinha, and Wei ZHANG. See "Cache Side-channel Attacks and Defenses of the Sliding Window Algorithm in TEEs" - Design, Automation and Test in Europe 2023.
Bugfix \* Refactor mbedtls\_aes\_context to support shallow-copying. Fixes #2147. \* Fix an issue with in-tree CMake builds in releases with GEN\_FILES turned off: if a shipped file was missing from the working directory, it could be turned into a symbolic link to itself. \* Fix a long-standing build failure when building x86 PIC code with old gcc (4.x). The code will be slower, but will compile. We do however recommend upgrading to a more recent compiler instead. Fixes #1910. \* Fix support for little-endian Microblaze when MBEDTLS\_HAVE\_ASM is defined. Contributed by Kazuyuki Kimura to fix #2020. \* Use double quotes to include private header file psa\_crypto\_cipher.h. Fixes 'file not found with <angled> include' error when building with Xcode. \* Fix handling of broken symlinks when loading certificates using mbedtls\_x509\_crt\_parse\_path(). Instead of returning an error as soon as a broken link is encountered, skip the broken link and continue parsing other certificate files. Contributed by Eduardo Silva in #2602. \* Fix an interoperability failure between an Mbed TLS client with both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 support, and a TLS 1.2 server that supports rsa\_pss\_rsae\_\* signature algorithms. This failed because Mbed TLS advertised support for PSS in both TLS 1.2 and 1.3, but only actually supported PSS in TLS 1.3. \* Fix a compilation error when using CMake with an IAR toolchain. Fixes #5964. \* Fix a build error due to a missing prototype warning when MBEDTLS\_DEPRECATED\_REMOVED is enabled. \* Fix mbedtls\_ctr\_drbg\_free() on an initialized but unseeded context. When MBEDTLS\_AES\_ALT is enabled, it could call mbedtls\_aes\_free() on an uninitialized context. \* Fix a build issue on Windows using CMake where the source and build directories could not be on different drives. Fixes #5751. \* Fix bugs and missing dependencies when building and testing configurations with only one encryption type enabled in TLS 1.2. \* Provide the missing definition of mbedtls\_setbuf() in some configurations with MBEDTLS\_PLATFORM\_C disabled. Fixes #6118, #6196. \* Fix compilation errors when trying to build with PSA drivers for AEAD (GCM, CCM, Chacha20-Poly1305). \* Fix memory leak in ssl\_parse\_certificate\_request() caused by mbedtls\_x509\_get\_name() not freeing allocated objects in case of error. Change mbedtls\_x509\_get\_name() to clean up allocated objects on error. \* Fix build failure with MBEDTLS\_RSA\_C and MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C but not MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO or MBEDTLS\_PK\_WRITE\_C. Fixes #6408. \* Fix build failure with MBEDTLS\_RSA\_C and MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C but not MBEDTLS\_PK\_PARSE\_C. Fixes #6409. \* Fix ECDSA verification, where it was not always validating the public key. This bug meant that it was possible to verify a signature with an invalid public key, in some cases. Reported by Guido Vranken using Cryptofuzz in #4420. \* Fix a possible null pointer dereference if a memory allocation fails in TLS PRF code. Reported by Michael Madsen in #6516. \* Fix TLS 1.3 session resumption. Fixes #6488. \* Add a configuration check to exclude optional client authentication in TLS 1.3 (where it is forbidden). \* Fix a bug in which mbedtls\_x509\_crt\_info() would produce non-printable bytes when parsing certificates containing a binary RFC 4108 HardwareModuleName as a Subject Alternative Name extension. Hardware serial numbers are now rendered in hex format. Fixes #6262. \* Fix bug in error reporting in dh\_genprime.c where upon failure, the error code returned by mbedtls\_mpi\_write\_file() is overwritten and therefore not printed. \* In the bignum module, operations of the form (-A) - (+A) or (-A) - (-A) with A > 0 created an unintended representation of the value 0 which was not processed correctly by some bignum operations. Fix this. This had no consequence on cryptography code, but might affect applications that call bignum directly and use negative numbers. \* Fix a bug whereby the list of signature algorithms sent as part of the TLS 1.2 server certificate request would get corrupted, meaning the first algorithm would not get sent and an entry consisting of two random bytes would be sent instead. Found by Serban Bejan and Dudek Sebastian. \* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) of mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_mpi(), mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_abs() and mbedtls\_mpi\_add\_int() when both operands are 0 and the left operand is represented with 0 limbs. \* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) when some bignum functions receive the most negative value of mbedtls\_mpi\_sint. Credit to OSS-Fuzz. Fixes #6597. \* Fix undefined behavior (typically harmless in practice) in PSA ECB encryption and decryption. \* Move some SSL-specific code out of libmbedcrypto where it had been placed accidentally. \* Fix a build error when compiling the bignum module for some Arm platforms. Fixes #6089, #6124, #6217.
Changes \* Add the ability to query PSA\_WANT\_xxx macros to query\_compile\_time\_config. \* Calling AEAD tag-specific functions for non-AEAD algorithms (which should not be done - they are documented for use only by AES-GCM and ChaCha20+Poly1305) now returns MBEDTLS\_ERR\_CIPHER\_FEATURE\_UNAVAILABLE instead of success (0).

Prevent bounds check bypass through overflow in PSK identity parsing

```
The check `if( *p + n > end )` in `ssl_parse_client_psk_identity` is
unsafe because `*p + n` might overflow, thus bypassing the check. As
`n` is a user-specified value up to 65K, this is relevant if the
library happens to be located in the last 65K of virtual memory.

This commit replaces the check by a safe version.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [mbedtls](/security/cves?package=mbedtls) - lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library - crypto library

## Details

It was discovered that mbedtls has a bounds-check bypass through an integer

overflow that can be used by an attacked to execute arbitrary code or cause a

denial of service.

([CVE-2017-18187](/security/CVE-2017-18187))

It was discovered that mbedtls has a vulnerability where an attacker could

execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow)

via a crafted certificate chain that is mishandled during RSASSA-PSS

signature verification within a TLS or DTLS session.

([CVE-2018-0487](/security/CVE-2018-0487))

It was discovered that mbedtls has a vulnerability where an attacker could

execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap corruption) via a

crafted application packet within a TLS or DTLS session.

([CVE-2018-0488](/security/CVE-2018-0488))

It was discovered that mbedtls has a vulnerability that allows remote

attackers to achieve partial plaintext recovery (for a CBC based ciphersuite)

via a timing-based side-channel attack.

([CVE-2018-0497](/security/CVE-2018-0497))

It was discovered that mbedtls has a vulnerability that allows local users to

achieve partial plaintext recovery (for a CBC based ciphersuite) via a

cache-based side-channel attack.

([CVE-2018-0498](/security/CVE-2018-0498))

# mbed TLS: Multiple vulnerabilites — GLSA **201804-19**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in mbed TLS, the worst of
which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/mbedtls** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.2** |

### Background

mbed TLS (previously PolarSSL) is an “easy to understand, use,
integrate and expand” implementation of the TLS and SSL protocols and
the respective cryptographic algorithms and support code required.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in mbed TLS. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, through multiple vectors, could possibly execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a Denial of
Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All mbed TLS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/mbedtls-2.7.2"
