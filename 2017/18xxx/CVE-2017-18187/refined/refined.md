  "CVE-2017-18187": {
    "description": "The check `if( *p + n > end )` in `ssl_parse_client_psk_identity` is unsafe because `*p + n` might overflow, thus bypassing the check. As `n` is a user-specified value up to 65K, this is relevant if the library happens to be located in the last 65K of virtual memory.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in bounds check.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure or a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious client during TLS handshake",
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a malicious client establishing a TLS connection with a vulnerable server. User controlled input is the size of the PSK identity.",
