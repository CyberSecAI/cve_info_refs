Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within the Trello board importer resource in Atlassian Jira. Specifically, the title of a Trello card is not properly sanitized when imported into Jira.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious HTML or JavaScript injected into a Trello card title is stored within the Jira application and executed when a user views the imported data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript, leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser when a Jira user views the imported data.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information (e.g., session cookies, Jira data).
- **Account Manipulation:** The attacker may be able to perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user (e.g. modify issues, perform administrative tasks).
- **Phishing:** An attacker might use the XSS to redirect the user to a malicious website designed to steal user credentials.
- **Defacement:**  An attacker could alter the appearance of Jira pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Trello Board Import:** The attack vector is through importing a Trello board into Jira, specifically by including malicious script in the title of the Trello card.
- **Jira User Interaction:** The attacker needs a Jira administrator to import the malicious Trello board into Jira in order to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Trello Account:**  The attacker needs a Trello account to create and modify boards and cards.
- **Malicious Input Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a Trello board with specially crafted card titles containing malicious code.
- **Jira Administrator Convincing:** The attacker must convince a Jira administrator to import their malicious Trello board to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is labeled as a 'High' priority and a severity level of 'Major'.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Jira versions 7.6.1 and 7.7.0.
- It is a Stored XSS (sxss) vulnerability
