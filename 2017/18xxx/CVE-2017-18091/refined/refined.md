Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the filename of a backup in the `admin backupprogress` action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker with administrative privileges can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing sensitive information (if combined with other vulnerabilities)
    - Performing actions with the privileges of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the filename of a backup. An attacker, with administrative privileges, can create a backup with a malicious filename containing JavaScript or HTML. The vulnerable `admin backupprogress` action then renders the filename without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of the injected code in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges in Atlassian Fisheye or Crucible.
- The attacker needs to be able to create backups with attacker-controlled filenames.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Atlassian Fisheye and Crucible versions before 4.4.3 (for the 4.4.x branch)
- Atlassian Fisheye and Crucible versions before 4.5.0
