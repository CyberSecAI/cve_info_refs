The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in CMS Web-Gooroo version 1.141 and earlier. It does not relate to CVE-2017-18346.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input ($_POST['wbg_login']) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Weakness:** Unsafe construction of SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/wbg/core/_includes/authorization.inc.php` with malicious SQL code in the `wbg_login` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to bypass authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database and the system.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.

2.  **Hardcoded Admin User:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application contains hardcoded credentials that bypass the regular authentication mechanism.
    *   **Weakness:** Use of hardcoded credentials in the authentication logic.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/wbg/core/_includes/authorization.inc.php` with the hardcoded `wbg_login` and `wbg_password` values (after applying MD5 hashes).
    *    **Impact**: Bypasses normal authentication and grants admin privileges
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.

3.  **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of input validation and overall bad design exposes server-side file paths. The log file path is an example.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate input validation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing files directly on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposes sensitive information about the server's file system.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the file structure or probing the system directly to expose the information.

4.  **Unrestricted File Upload:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of file type validation during the file upload process in the admin panel.
    *   **Weakness:** Missing file validation or sanitization.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading malicious files using the admin panel's attachment functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires admin access
