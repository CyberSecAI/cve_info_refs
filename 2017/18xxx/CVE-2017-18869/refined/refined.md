  "CVE-2017-18869": {
    "Description": "The `chownr` npm package before 1.1.0 is vulnerable to a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. The vulnerability occurs because the package checks if a path is a symbolic link and, if not, recursively changes the ownership. However, the check and the chown operation are not atomic. This allows an attacker to replace a directory with a symlink after the check is performed but before the ownership change, causing the `chownr` operation to traverse unintended directories.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "TOCTOU race condition due to non-atomic check and chown operation",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can trick the package into descending into unintended directories by replacing a non-symlink with a symlink at a critical moment, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in file ownership.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local file system manipulation. An attacker needs to be able to modify the file system while the chownr operation is running.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the file system, specifically by creating symlinks and replacing existing directories with symlinks, concurrently with the vulnerable `chownr` operation."
