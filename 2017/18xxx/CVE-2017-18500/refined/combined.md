## FAQ

### How to adjust Social Buttons position on the page ?

In WordPress admin panel, please go to “Social Buttons” settings page and choose one of the listed positions: Before content or After content. Then click “Save Changes”.

### How to change Facebook Button icon (“Profile URL”)?

1. In WordPress admin panel, please go to “Social Buttons” > “Facebook” and choose one of the listed options: Default Profile Button Image or Custom Profile Button Image. Then click “Save Changes”.
2. If you choose Custom Profile Button Image, you can upload your own picture. You should click “Choose file” and choose an image in your folder. Then click “Save Changes”.

### After clicking Facebook Button icon, I see the Facebook Home page instead of the necessary account page

1. In WordPress admin panel, please go to “Social Buttons” > “Facebook” settings page and enter your Facebook ID or username. Then click “Save Changes”.
2. If you do not have the Facebook account yet, you should create it here. After the account is created, please follow the instructions above.

### When people like and/or leave comments to my post, will this be displayed on my Facebook page?

No, it will not. The case is: Like for a WordPress site is a Like of a certain URL, but not the page content, while on Facebook it’s Like of the content, not the URL. I.e. these are two different things, and it is impossible to link them.

For more data on the Like button, please check the developers’ page (<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button>).

### If I install a new version of the plugin, will I lose all the likes I got on the previous version (I mean will they switch to zero on my website?)?

You will not lose them because they are stored on the Facebook server.

### I’ve changed meta tags (image and description), but when I click “Share” button, all data stay the same (unchanged)

The case is, after the first circulation to the page, Facebook cache an information about it. These data from the cache are used during the next 24 hours.

That is why the changes are not displayed. You can wait for 24 hours and check changes, or you can forcibly update the information about your page on Facebook:

1. Go to <https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/>

2. Enter a URL of your page in “Input URL” field and click “Fetch new scrape information” button

### Can I control the order of the Twitter recommended accounts?

Only two accounts are displayed and by default the via user is shown first with the first related account shown afterwards. If the user is a follower of the via user the Share Box will instead show the first two related accounts the user isn’t a follower of. No accounts are displayed if the user follows all of the suggested accounts (via and related).

### Pinterest Follow button is not displaying properly

In WordPress admin panel, please go to “Social Buttons” > “Pinterest” settings page and check if Pinterest username is correct.

### Pinterest widget is not displaying

Check if widget URL is correct or pin/board/profile exists.

### Why isn’t the counter of LinkedIn Share button displaуed in horizontal display mode?

It happens when your page or post isn’t shared.

### I’ve added LinkedIn widgets to my sidebar. Why are they cropped?

Beсause the “Company Insider” widget has 633px width and other LinkedIn widgets have 300px width.

### Why don’t LinkedIn widgets display on my site?

To display widgets, you must fill fields, such as ‘Public Profile URL’, ‘Company ID’ or ‘School ID’.

### Why doesn’t LinkedIn widget ‘Member Profile’ display?

URL, which you add, should be public. It can be configured via “public profile settings” in your Linkedin account.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

– The link to the page where the problem occurs

– The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.

– The version of your WordPress installation

– Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://bestwebsoft.com/documentation/admin-panel-issues/system-status/)

Easy to install & set up.
