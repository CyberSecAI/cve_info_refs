Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18030:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds access issue in the `cirrus_invalidate_region` routine within the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator support in QEMU.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Out-of-bounds access: Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the initial pitch is negative during the process of refreshing the VNC surface area.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): A privileged user inside the guest operating system can exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a privileged user within the guest operating system. The user must trigger the `cirrus_invalidate_region` function with a negative initial pitch.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have privileged access within the guest OS running on the vulnerable QEMU instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during VNC surface area refresh.
*   The provided information includes the upstream patch commit that fixes this issue in the QEMU repository.
