The provided document is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a command injection vulnerability affecting multiple wireless access points.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The advisory indicates a "command injection vulnerability" exists in the affected products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The vulnerability is a command injection type, which means that an attacker can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the underlying system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 rating of 6.7 which is considered medium and the vector string includes "C:H/I:H/A:H" indicating that successful exploitation could lead to high impact in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- The advisory states: "The command injection vulnerability remains if you do not complete all recommended steps." Meaning, if a user doesn't update their firmware, the vulnerability will remain exploitable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The CVSS vector shows "AV:L" which means the attack vector is local. This indicates that the attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a high privilege level on the device or network to exploit the vulnerability. This is indicated by "PR:H" in the CVSS vector.
- The advisory states that "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H" which implies low attack complexity.
