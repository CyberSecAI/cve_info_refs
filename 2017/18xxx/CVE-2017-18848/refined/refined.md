This document describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability affecting several Netgear router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document does not provide the specific technical root cause, but indicates that the vulnerability is related to Cross-Site Request Forgery.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability that allows an attacker to perform actions on the router through a user's browser without the user's consent, provided the user is logged in.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected router as an administrator. This could include modifying router configurations, such as changing DNS settings, firewall rules, or even flashing malicious firmware.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via a malicious web page that the victim user visits. If the user is logged into the router's administrative interface while browsing this malicious page, the attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure a user into visiting a crafted web page while the user is also logged into their Netgear router's administration interface.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious request to target the specific vulnerable endpoints on the router's web interface.

**Affected products:**
- R6300v2 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.36
- AC1450 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.36
- R7300 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.54
- R8500 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.94

**Mitigation:** Update to the latest firmware versions.

**CVSS v3 Rating:**
- High
- CVSS v3 Base Score: 8.8
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
