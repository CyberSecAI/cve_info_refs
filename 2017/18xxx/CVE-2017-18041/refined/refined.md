- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `viewDeploymentVersionJiraIssuesDialog` resource in Atlassian Bamboo does not properly sanitize the release name, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript, potentially leading to malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the `viewDeploymentVersionJiraIssuesDialog` resource by manipulating the name of a release.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create or modify releases with a malicious name.
