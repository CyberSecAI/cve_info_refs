- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way Atlassian Fisheye handles commit author names. It does not properly sanitize the input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious code within the commit author's name, which is then displayed within Fisheye.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a commit with a malicious author name.
