# USN-3638-1: QPDF vulnerabilities

7 May 2018

Several security issues were fixed in QPDF.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [qpdf](/security/cves?package=qpdf) - tools for transforming and inspecting PDF files

## Details

It was discovered that QPDF incorrectly handled certain malformed files. A

remote attacker could use this issue to cause QPDF to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

## Description

[![@hannob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990588?v=4&size=48)](/hannob)[hannob](https://github.com/hannob)opened [on Aug 12, 2017](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/issues/143#issue-249796234)

The attached file will crash qpdf. It seems it's running into an endless recursion and thus a stack overflow.

Found with afl.
