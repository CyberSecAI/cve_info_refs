The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a command injection vulnerability. Although the advisory does not directly link to a CVE ID, it provides detailed information about the vulnerability, affected products, and mitigation steps.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the firmware of several NETGEAR router models. The advisory does not specify the exact vulnerable code location or the vulnerable functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system via the vulnerable firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full system compromise: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the affected service. This can lead to:
    -  Complete control of the device
    -  Data exfiltration or manipulation
    -  Denial of service
    -  Installation of malware

**Attack Vectors:**
- The advisory does not specify how the attacker would inject the command (e.g., web interface, API endpoint). However, the CVSS vector implies the attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker would need local access to the affected device. This is inconsistent with most remote attack vectors common for router vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Access (CVSS:3.0/AV:L): The CVSS vector indicates the attacker needs local access, but routers are usually attacked remotely. This indicates a likely flaw in the CVSS assignment.
- It can be assumed that the vulnerability likely exists through a web interface, API endpoint, or other network service as local access is not typical for router vulnerabilities. The attacker can likely be remote by sending a crafted malicious payload/request.

**Affected Products:**
The following NETGEAR product models are affected:
*   R6300v2 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.8\_10.0.77
*   R6400 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.24
*   R6700 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.26
*   R7000 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.9.10
*   R7100LG running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.32
*   R7900 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.18
*   R8000 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.54
*   R8500 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.100
*   D6100 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.50\_0.0.50

**Mitigation:**
- The advisory recommends users update to the latest firmware versions provided by NETGEAR.

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS v3 Score: 8.4 (High)
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  - It is important to note the Access Vector (AV) is listed as local, which contradicts the typical remote exploit vectors of most router vulnerabilities. It is likely that this was a miscalculation, or there may have been other methods of exploitation that require local access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory emphasizes the importance of updating to the latest firmware and disclaims responsibility for any consequences due to not following these recommendations.
- The advisory includes a contact email for security concerns.
- The advisory was published on April 10, 2017, and last updated on October 4, 2017.

This document provides more detail than a typical CVE description, offering specific affected product versions and mitigation steps. The absence of a CVE ID is uncommon, but the provided information is useful for understanding the command injection vulnerability in these NETGEAR products.
