# Authenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability in Posts in Page

One of the things we do to make sure our customers have the best data on vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins is to monitor hacking attempts on our websites. Through that we recently came across a request for a file, /wp-content/plugins/posts-in-page/assets/posts\_in\_page\_help\_view.php, from the plugin [Posts in Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-in-page/).

Nothing in that file looks like it could be exploited, so it looks like that request was instead probing for usage of the plugin. In looking over the rest of the code of the plugin we did find one vulnerability, that might be of more interest to hackers with the recent exploitation of a vulnerability in WordPress 4.7.0 and 4.7.1 that allowed an attacker to modify posts.

In the file /lib/page\_posts.php we first found that it looked like it might be possible for arbitrary files to be [included](http://php.net/manual/en/function.include.php) through the following that [requires](http://php.net/manual/en/function.require.php) a specified file:

| ``` 186 187 188  ``` | ``` require ( $file_path = self::has_theme_template() ) 	? $file_path // use template file in theme 	: POSTSPAGE_DIR . '/posts_loop_template.php'; // use default plugin template file ``` |
| --- | --- |

require ( $file\_path = self::has\_theme\_template() )
? $file\_path // use template file in theme
: POSTSPAGE\_DIR . '/posts\_loop\_template.php'; // use default plugin template file

The function has\_theme\_template called there looks like this:

| ``` 164 165 166 167 168 169 170  ``` | ``` protected function has_theme_template() { 	$template_file = ( $this->args['template'] ) 		? get_stylesheet_directory()  . '/' . $this->args['template'] // use specified template file 		: get_stylesheet_directory() . '/posts_loop_template.php'; // use default template file   	return ( file_exists( $template_file ) ) ? $template_file : false; } ``` |
| --- | --- |

protected function has\_theme\_template() {
$template\_file = ( $this->args['template'] )
? get\_stylesheet\_directory() . '/' . $this->args['template'] // use specified template file
: get\_stylesheet\_directory() . '/posts\_loop\_template.php'; // use default template file
return ( file\_exists( $template\_file ) ) ? $template\_file : false;
}

The value of $this->args[‘template’] in that comes from the “template” attribute of the plugin’s shortcode. There is no restriction on who can use that shortcode or attribute, so contributor-level and above users can cause any file on the website to be included through the use of directory traversal, which is an authenticated local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

For author-level and above users there is a more serious issue as they have ability to upload media through WordPress. It is possible to upload media file that contain PHP code in them. Normally that code would not be able to run because the file extension of the file would not be one that causes the web server to execute it, but including such a file through a vulnerability like this would allow it to run.

## Proof of Concept

When logged in as user that can add new posts, adding the following proof of concept to a post’s content will include a file named test.php from the root directory when viewing the resulting post (it will be included even when previewing the post):

```
[ic_add_posts template='../../../test.php']
```
## Timeline

* February 8, 2016 –  Developer notified.
* February 13, 2017 – WordPress.org Plugin Directory notified.
* February 13, 2017 – Vulnerability added to the free data included with our [services’s companion plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-vulnerabilities/).
* February 14, 2017 – Version 1.3.0 released, which fixes vulnerability.

   Thank you for your report and your commitment to security in the plugin repository.

   You can see the snippets of code mentioned as potentially exploitable in this report on line 186, self::has\_theme\_template returns a file in the theme directory.

   A user cannot upload a file via Media and have it included here. We require the file to be in the theme folder and, if it’s not there, fall back to the posts\_loop\_template.php file in the plugin’s directory.

   Again, it is not possible for even an Admin level user to designate a file outside the template directory. When they try, it fails the file exists test (those lines are testing for the template and if found, use it and if not found, use the default) and the default template is loaded instead.

     For anyone wondering about the previous comment, we were subsequently able to clear up the confusion the developer had about how directory traversal works and a new version that fixes the issue should be out soon.

## Description

Easily add one or more posts to any page using simple shortcodes.

Supports categories, tags, custom post types, custom taxonomies, date ranges, post status, and much more.

You can get all of the same functionality provided by this plugin by modifying your theme’s template files; this plugin just makes it easy for anyone to *pull* posts into other areas of the site without having to get their hands dirty with code.

Plugin is depending upon your theme’s styling; version 1.x of this plugin *does not* contain native styles.

This is a minimal plugin, function over form. Give us feedback, suggestions, bug reports, and any other contributions on the in the plugin’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ivycat/posts-in-page).

  Embed shortcodes directly in your template using `do_shortcode`.

## Installation

You can install from within WordPress using the Plugin/Add New feature, or if you wish to manually install:

1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the entire `posts-in-page` directory to your plugins folder
3. Activate the plugin from the plugin page in your WordPress Dashboard
4. Start embedding posts in whatever pages you like using shortcodes.

### Shortcode Usage

To ‘pull’ posts into a page, you can:

1. place a shortcode in the editor window of the page you’re editing (Classic Editor),
2. place a shortcode in a shortcode block on the page you’re editing (Gutenberg Editor),
3. modify a theme template file using the shortcode in a PHP function.

#### Using Shortcodes in the WordPress editor

* `[ic_add_posts]` – Add all posts to a page (limit to what number posts in WordPress is set to), essentially adds blog “page” to page.
* `[ic_add_posts post_type='post_type']` – Show posts from a custom post type by specifying the post type slug (must give post type if not a standard post). Add multiple post types by separating with commas (ex. `post_type='post_type1,post_type2'`).
* `[ic_add_posts showposts='5']` – Limit number of posts (or override default setting).
* `[ic_add_posts orderby='title' order='ASC']` – Order the post output using `orderby` – supports all WP [orderby parameters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters). Order is optional, default is ‘DESC’.
* `[ic_add_posts ids='1,2,3']` – Show one or many posts by specifying the post ID(s) (specify all post types).
* `[ic_add_posts exclude_ids='4,5,6']` – Exclude specific post ID(s) from the query.
* `[ic_add_posts category='category-slug']` – Show posts within a specific category by category slug. Separate multiple categories with commas.
* `[ic_add_posts cats='2,13']` – Show posts within a specific category by category IDs. Separate multiple categories with commas.
* `[ic_add_posts exclude_category='category-slug']` – Exclude posts within specific category. Uses slugs, can list multiple category slugs separated by commas.
* `[ic_add_posts tag='tag-slug']` – Show posts using a specific tag. Like categories, it uses slugs, and can accommodate multiple tags separated by commas.
* `[ic_add_posts tax='taxonomy' term='term']` – Limit posts to those that exist in a taxonomy and have a specific term. Both are required for either one to work and you must specify custom post\_types.
* `[ic_add_posts post_format='post-format-status']` – Select post formats. Use ‘post-format-‘ followed by the format type (chat, aside, video, etc.). Use comma to separate post formats. To pull all posts with the quotes format, you’d use `[ic_add_posts post_format='post-format-quote']`.
* `[ic_add_posts ignore_sticky_posts='no']` – Show sticky posts too (they’re ignored by default).
* `[ic_add_posts paginate='yes']` – Use pagination links (off by default).
* `[ic_add_posts label_next='Next' label_previous='Previous']` – Customize ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ labels used by pagination.
* `[ic_add_posts post_status='private']` – Show posts with the specified status. By default it shows only posts with ‘publish’ status. To select multiple statuses, separate them with commas like so: `post_status='private,publish'`.
* `[ic_add_posts more_tag='Read more']` – Set the link text for read more links shown after an excerpt.
* `[ic_add_posts date='today-1']` – Choose the relative date of included posts. Supports formatting like `date='today-1'` (today minus 1 day), `date='week-2'` (today minus 2 weeks), `date='month-1'` (today minus 1 month), `date='year-1'` (today minus 1 year).
* `[ic_add_posts from_date='15-01-2016' to_date='31-12-2016']` – Shows posts published within a specified absolute date range.
* `[ic_add_posts offset='3']` – Displays posts after the offset. An `offset='3'` will show all posts from the 4th one back.
* `[ic_add_posts none_found='No Posts Found']` – Custom message to display when no posts are found.
* `[ic_add_posts template='template-in-theme-dir.php']` – In case you want to style your markup, add meta data, etc. Each shortcode can reference a different template. These templates must exist in the theme directory or in a sub-directory named *posts-in-page*.

Or any combination of the above.

#### Shortcode Examples

Not sure how to use the shortcodes above to get what you want? Here are a few examples to get you started:

\*\* Example 1 \*\*

Let’s say you want to pull a specific post called *“What I love about coffee”*, which has a post ID of 34, somewhere on your About Us page. Your shortcode should look like this:

```
[ic_add_posts ids='34']

```

\*\* Example 2 \*\*

Alright, now let’s say that you want to pull in all posts from two categories into your WordPress page. One category is *WordPress Rocks* and the other is *WordPress Rolls*. Plus, you’d like to display them three per page, rather than the default number of posts. Depending on your category slugs, your shortcode should probably look like this:

```
[ic_add_posts category='wordpress-rocks,wordpress-rolls' showposts='3']

```

\*\* Example 3 \*\*

Now, you’re ambitious and want to try something complex. Let’s say you’ve got a page called *Plugins Are Awesome* and, in it, you want to pull in posts that match the following criteria:

* posts from a custom post type called *Testimonials*,
* posts that are in the *Testimonial Type* custom taxonomy using the term *Customer*,
* you want to display six testimonials per page,
* you’d like them displayed in ascending order,
* finally, you’ve created a custom template to use in presenting these posts and named it `my-posts-in-page-template.php`.

Your shortcode might look like this:

```
[ic_add_posts showposts='6' post_type='testimonials' tax='testimonial-type' term='customer' order='ASC' template='my-posts-in-page-template.php']

```
#### Using Shortcodes within a PHP function

If you’d like to use this plugin to pull posts directly into your theme’s template files, you can drop the following WordPress function in your template files, replacing the `[shortcode]` part with your, custom shortcode.

```
<?php echo do_shortcode("[shortcode]"); ?>

There are several hooks you can use to filter the output of your template files:

* `posts_in_page_results` – Filter results
* `posts_in_page_args` – Filter the query arguments
* `posts_in_page_paginate` – Filter pagination
* `posts_in_page_pre_loop` – Runs right before the loop (posts\_loop\_template.php)
* `posts_in_page_post_loop` – Runs right after the loop

## FAQ

What is the point of this plugin?

Posts in Page makes it easy to output or embed the posts, pages, or custom post types in any page without modifying WordPress theme templates.

Does it work with Gutenberg?

Absolutely. Just use a Gutenberg Shortcode block or the Classic Edit block to add your shortcode.

Wait! The posts aren’t styled like the posts on the rest of my site.

That is likely true. Currently, Posts in Page doesn’t output any styles; just some basic markup. To change how the posts appear on the page, you’ll need to change the *output template*.

How do I change the output template?

Simply copy the `posts_loop_template.php` to your theme directory and make changes as necessary.

You can even rename it – but make sure to indicate that in the shortcode using the `template='my-new-template-name.php'`.

For file housekeeping, you can also create a *posts-in-page* folder in your theme to store all of your custom templates. It isn’t necessary to specify the *posts-in-page* folder in your shortcode – Posts in Page will find it automatically.

You can even use multiple templates for use with different shortcodes.

Does it work with custom post types?

Absolutely.

Does it work with custom taxonomies?

You bet.

Will it make me coffee?

Not likely, but let us know if it does; then we’ll *know* we have something special.

How can I help?

We’d love feedback, issues, pull requests, and ideas on the [Posts in Page GitHub repo](https://github.com/ivycat/posts-in-page).
