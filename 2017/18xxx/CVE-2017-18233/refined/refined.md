  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists within the `Chunk` class in the `RIFF.cpp` file of the Exempi library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted .avi file containing malicious XMP data can cause an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed .avi file. An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted .avi file with a malicious XMP metadata to a system that utilizes the vulnerable Exempi library.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted .avi file to a system that uses the vulnerable Exempi library.",
   "additional_details": "The vulnerability is due to an incorrect size calculation when reading a chunk. The `oldSize` is calculated incorrectly. The fix involves reading the size and adding 8 to it instead of adding 8 directly while reading the size from the file."
