## FAQ

### Can Contact Form to DB work without regular Contact Form plugin?

This plugin was created specifically as an extension for [Contact Form](https://bestwebsoft.com/products/wordpress/plugins/contact-form/?k=1f9b7d7895c20420af788d9413ed8562) plugin.

It can receive messages ONLY from Contact Form plugin.

In case you used Contact Form plugin with Contact Form to DB plugin earlier and decide to delete or deactivate it, Contact Form to DB plugin will work as an archive for your old messages.

### In which formats can I save the messages?

You can save messages in “csv”, “xml”, and “eml” formats.

### I don’t want the “Send counter” bar in my list of messages. How can I remove it?

Click on “Screen Options” button in the right top corner on manager page and deselect the item “Send counter”.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

– The link to the page where the problem occurs

– The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.

– The version of your WordPress installation

– Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://bestwebsoft.com/documentation/admin-panel-issues/system-status/).

How come that we can’t set the Reply-To field ?
Does it require the “Pro” version ?
