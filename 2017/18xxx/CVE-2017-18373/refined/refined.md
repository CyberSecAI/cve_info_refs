The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in ZyXEL and Billion routers, including CVE-2017-18373.

**CVE-2017-18373:**

*   **Root Cause:** This CVE refers to the presence of default administrative credentials on the Billion 5200W-T router.
*   **Vulnerability:** The router ships with hardcoded administrative accounts, including:
    *   username: admin; password: password
    *   username: true; password: true
    *   username: user3; password: 12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678
*   **Impact:** Attackers can use these default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the router's administrative interface.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote access through the web interface, leveraging the default credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to the router and knowledge of the default credentials.

**Additional Information from the provided documents:**

*   The affected routers are distributed by TrueOnline, a Thai ISP, and are rebranded versions of ZyXEL and Billion models.
*   The routers use a custom Linux distribution called "tclinux" and run a BOA web server.
*   The content also describes other vulnerabilities including unauthenticated and authenticated command injections in various models of ZyXEL and Billion routers. These are assigned separate CVE IDs: CVE-2017-18368, CVE-2017-18369, CVE-2017-18370, CVE-2017-18372, CVE-2017-18371 and CVE-2017-18374.
*   The command injection vulnerabilities occur mostly in the syslog remote forwarding functionality.
*   The unauthenticated command injection vulnerabilities can be exploited directly, while the authenticated ones can be combined with default credentials to gain remote code execution as root.
*   There is no official fix for these vulnerabilities and users are advised to block untrusted access.
*   Metasploit modules have been developed to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   ZyXEL has acknowledged the vulnerabilities for the P660HN-T v1 and v2 models and released information about upcoming fixes.
