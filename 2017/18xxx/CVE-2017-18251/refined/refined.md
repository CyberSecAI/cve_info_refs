  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2017-18251",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a memory leak in the `ReadPCDImage` function of ImageMagick.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The code allocates memory for `chroma1`, `chroma2`, and `luma` using `AcquireQuantumMemory`. If the allocation for any of these fails (returns NULL), the code throws an exception but does not release previously allocated memory."
      ],
      "impact": "The memory leak can lead to a denial of service by exhausting available memory if an attacker can repeatedly trigger this allocation failure.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could trigger the memory leak by providing a malformed or crafted image file (specifically a PCD image) that causes memory allocation to fail, leading to the described memory leak.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PCD image to a system using ImageMagick and trigger the vulnerable `ReadPCDImage` function."
