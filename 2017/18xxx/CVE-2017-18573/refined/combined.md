#### Filters

\*\* Log Output Within the Table \*\*

*sll-output-data* – filters table row array where array keys are column names and values is the output

For example, we can use this filter to link IP addresses to a geo-location service:

```
<?php
add_filter( 'sll-output-data', 'link_location_by_ip' );
function link_location_by_ip($item){

    //$item is a single row for columns with their values

    $item['ip'] = sprintf('<a target="_blank"  href="http://infosniper.net/index.php?ip_address=%1$s&map_source=3&two_maps=1&overview_map=1&lang=1&map_type=1&zoom_level=11">%1$s</a>', $item['ip']);
    return $item;
}
?>

```
#### Translation

If you would like to contribute, the POT file is available in the *languages* folder. Translation file name convention is *sll-{locale}.mo*, where {locale} is the locale of your language. Fore example, Russian file name would be *sll-ru\_RU.po*.

This is one of the plugins that always work. I can’t explain why, as I am a layman.
But I know that it has been working flawlessly for the past 4 years for me.
Thanks for the plugin Mr Chirkov.
The wordpress search can’t find it by using search words Simple Login Log,
we need to type Simple Login Log by Max Chirkov to get to it.

This is a must have plugin if you build sites for others to use and maintain. Being able to identify the last user – before things went wrong – cuts time when called in to sort out any issues.

So simple to install and activate. If you want to know who logs into your account, this will give you the information. Love it, love it, love it.

### [Does not track "Remember Me" logins](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-not-track-remember-me-logins/)

Plugin seems to work pretty well, except for the fact that it does not seem to be picking up people who have opted for the “Remember Me” option on the login page, which makes it largely useless for my needs.

Lovely, lovely plugin, allowing me access to some very useful information. I really like the fact you can also track failed logins and see what username they were trying to use – helps answer some of our website support enquiries!
Thank you very much!
