The provided document is a security advisory from Netgear regarding an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting multiple router and extender models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The advisory states there is an authentication bypass security vulnerability, but does not provide technical details regarding the root cause.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** An authentication bypass vulnerability is present in the affected devices' firmware.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the device. This could lead to full control over the device and potentially the network it is connected to. The CVSS v3 score of 8.8 indicates a high severity.  The confidentiality, integrity, and availability can be fully compromised (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be within the adjacent network of the affected device. No user interaction (UI:N) or privileges (PR:N) are required for successful exploitation. Low attack complexity (AC:L) is required.

**Affected Devices:**

*   EX3700, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.64
*   EX3800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.64
*   EX6120, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.32
*   EX6130, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.16
*   R6300v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.12
*   R6700, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.26
*  R6900, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.22
*   R7000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.9.6
*   R7300DST, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.52
*   R7900, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.12
*   R8000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.24
*   R8500, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.74
