Based on the provided information, this commit addresses an information leak vulnerability in the `aacraid` driver.

- **Root Cause:** The `aac_send_raw_srb()` and `aac_get_hba_info()` functions in the `aacraid` driver could copy stack-allocated structures to userspace without initializing all members. This could lead to the disclosure of uninitialized stack memory.
- **Weakness:** Information exposure due to lack of memory initialization.
- **Impact:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information residing in the kernel stack memory.
- **Attack Vector:** By triggering the `aac_send_raw_srb()` or `aac_get_hba_info()` ioctls, an attacker could receive uninitialized kernel stack data.
- **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the relevant ioctls, suggesting a local privilege escalation scenario, or access to an interface that allows these ioctls to be invoked.

The fix involves using `memset` to zero out the `reply` and `hbainfo` structures before they are populated and copied to userspace, preventing the information leak.
