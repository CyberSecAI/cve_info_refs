The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding an admin credential disclosure vulnerability. While it doesn't have a CVE ID associated with it, it does discuss a vulnerability that could allow unauthorized access to the router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The advisory mentions an "admin credential disclosure security vulnerability" but doesn't specify the technical details of the root cause. It indicates the issue is in the firmware of the affected routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of admin credentials, meaning that a vulnerability exists that allows an attacker to gain access to the administrator password/credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the router's admin interface. This level of access would give the attacker complete control of the device, allowing them to potentially:
    - Modify router settings
    - Intercept network traffic
    - Redirect traffic to malicious sites
    - Perform other malicious activities on the network and devices connected to the router

**Attack vectors:**
The advisory indicates that the attack vector is *local* (AV:L) but does not provide details on the nature of the local access (physical or otherwise). This means that a local, non-network attacker is required. It does not require user interaction and has low attack complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An attacker must be able to access the router locally.
    - The attacker needs no special privileges on the system where the device is running (PR:N).
    - The attack does not require any user interaction (UI:N)

**Affected Devices and Firmware:**
The following devices and firmware are vulnerable:
    - R6700v2 running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.38
    - R6800 running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.38
    - D7000 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.50
