- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `messagesThreshold` parameter in the `IncomingMailServers` resource of Atlassian JIRA does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, phishing, or defacement of the application interface.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code through the `messagesThreshold` parameter of the `IncomingMailServers` resource.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable JIRA instance and manipulate the `messagesThreshold` parameter.
