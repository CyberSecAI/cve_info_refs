the “enquiry form” settings are quite buggy, the button and text constantly cross-switch between each other, making it impossible to have a stable form in the front end. I believe it’s due to the autosave.
custom button not working
the “add to cart” button is only hidden in the product page, but not on the quick view I got in my theme (Salient), where also the “quantity” is still visible. This means that the cart is hidden to view but is still there.
This plugin is not ready for all themes. You must hope it fits yours.

I installed this plug-in and bought the pro version , payed 80 USD for 1 year. After installing the plug-in , it didn’t work , it was just loading , not sending emails to me about the enquiry of the products, it just did not work. I contacted the support team after 2 days of trying to use it to give me my money back. On theyr website it is said that you have a 30 days refund policy. They don t respect it , the support team sends you an email to contact the “refund team”, and there no one is answearing.

I had the impression that since update 2.0 this plugin isn’t what it used to be. Team MultiVendorX jumped on the wagon to find a solution. And yes, I’m talking about the free version. After a couple of emails and sharing ideas, we found a solution that worked. It’s up and running with custom code thanks to a very quick update from the support team. Now available for everyone to use, if I’m not mistaken.

I spoke with Ria, who was fantastic at helping me resolve my issue. I had gone through and tried deactivating plug ins and themes, and the error still happened. Ria went through and worked some magic and now has got the plug in working how it is suppose to.
Really helpful, really friendly, very understanding.
Will be sure to use again.

Hi, I have purchased a full version of a plugin for 3 websites.
It did not work, no support.
I have requested a refund, sent 3 emails to chase, chased on a live chat.
They replied after 2 weeks.
I have replied with everything they wanted.
Another 2 weeks and nothing, no refund, no reply.
Worst customer service ever.
