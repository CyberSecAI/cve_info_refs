Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18240:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `collectd` init script manages the PID file. The init script creates the PID file directory and grants ownership to the user under which the `collectd` daemon runs (`COLLECTD_USER`). This allows the `COLLECTD_USER` to write arbitrary content into the PID file. When the service is stopped, root executes the `kill` command on the content of the PID file, which is controlled by an unprivileged user, leading to a potential privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure PID File Handling:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure handling of the PID file. By allowing an unprivileged user to write to the PID file, the system becomes susceptible to malicious manipulation.
- **Privilege Escalation via `kill` command:** Root executes `kill` on the PID specified in the PID file, which can be controlled by a lower privileged user.
- **Lack of Privilege Dropping in Daemon:**  `collectd` does not drop privileges itself. The init script starts `collectd` as the `COLLECTD_USER`, which then creates the PID file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker who is the `COLLECTD_USER` or part of the `COLLECTD_GROUP` can gain root privileges by writing malicious content into the PID file.  This is because when stopping the service, the root user will attempt to kill whatever is in that file, and the attacker can control that.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system and must be the same user as the `collectd` daemon or a member of the `COLLECTD_GROUP`.
- **PID File Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the content of the PID file, replacing the valid PID with a malicious command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user with the same privileges as the `collectd` daemon (`COLLECTD_USER`) or a member of the `COLLECTD_GROUP`.
- Ability to write to the PID file location.

**Additional Details from the Bug Report:**

- The bug report clarifies that the `start-stop-daemon` utility does not properly validate the PID in the PID file against the actual running process, which is a key aspect to the exploit.
- The fix involves running `collectd` in foreground mode and letting the init system handle the PID file with proper permissions instead of allowing collectd user to create and modify the file. This prevents the user from manipulating the file content.
- tmpfiles is used to manage /run/collectd/ directory which is default location for collectd's UNIX socket.
- The vulnerability is addressed by version 5.7.2-r1 of the package.
