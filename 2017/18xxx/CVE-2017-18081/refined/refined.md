- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `signupUser` resource in Atlassian Bamboo is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the `csrf` token cookie value, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, phishing, or defacement of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `signupUser` resource via the value of the `csrf` token cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
