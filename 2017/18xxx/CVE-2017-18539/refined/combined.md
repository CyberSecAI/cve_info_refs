As a non-lending family history society, we wanted a plugin which would enable members to search the library catalogue and display results. We did not require the circulation side of it as we don‚Äôt lend materials. We also wanted the ability to enter the category and subject so have added those to the database\_code\_php so that the librarian can select from each without having to retype every time. The librarian can export to a CSV file (already provided), and can now search the collection using Title, ISBN, Keyword, Call Number etc and sort on those headings as well. This has the bones of a good program for our needs and I had searched long and hard before downloading this one.

I tried loading this onto a subdomain site with the theme ‚ÄòEvolve‚Äô. Each time the plugin uploaded and activated, but soon as I added a library user the subdomain site and my main site froze. I had to delete the plugin in order to restore. Maybe this is a good plugin but not for me. I have no option but to look for an alternative.
