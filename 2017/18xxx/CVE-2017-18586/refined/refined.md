  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper escaping of the class attribute in the Insert Pages shortcode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Lower-privileged users (e.g., Contributors) could inject malicious JavaScript into the Insert Pages shortcode, which would then execute when an administrator previews their post. This could allow an attacker to perform actions as the administrator.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious shortcode with JavaScript in the class attribute and inserting it into a post."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to create or edit posts, requiring at least 'Contributor' level privileges. Additionally, they need an administrator to preview or view their content for the javascript to execute."
