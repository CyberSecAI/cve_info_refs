- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication checks in various administrative system import resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can run import operations and determine if an internal service exists.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing administrative external system import resources without proper authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote access to the vulnerable Jira server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
