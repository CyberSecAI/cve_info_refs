  "CVE-2017-18026": {
    "Description": "The provided content contains details about a security fix for Redmine related to the Mercurial adapter. This aligns with CVE-2017-18026, which describes a remote command execution vulnerability through the Mercurial adapter.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how Mercurial parses command arguments, specifically related to early command options such as '--config' and '--debugger'. These options can be injected anywhere, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution because extensions can be loaded using the '--config extensions.<name>=' option.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper handling of command arguments by Mercurial.",
       "Injection of malicious command arguments leading to arbitrary command execution."
    ],
     "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution on the server hosting Redmine, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted Mercurial commands using the vulnerable options ('--config', '--debugger', '-R', '--repository').",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide input that is processed by the Redmine Mercurial adapter, for example by manipulating repository URLs."
