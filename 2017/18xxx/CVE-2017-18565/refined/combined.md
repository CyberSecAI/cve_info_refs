## FAQ

### The plugin doesn’t send any emails

Please follow the instructions below:

1. Check the plugin settings ‘/wp-admin/admin.php?page=updater-options’
2. The plugin sends email notifications if any updates are available.
3. Some email messages can be marked as spam on the server. Enter email address (‘Send Email Notifications from’ option), for example, gmail account or similar. If the message is approved (sent), this means that the email filtering is configured on your server.
4. Perhaps you didn’t configure email sending. In this case You should install [SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bws-smtp/) plugin and configure it. Afterwards you should send a test email from this plugin and you will see if the plugin logs have errors.

### The plugin stopped sending emails after some time. What’s the problem?

The plugin sends email notification if any updates are available. If there are no updates available, you won’t get anything.

### Sending time does not correspond to that specified on the settings page

The function of sending emails and updating runs when the site is active (when someone visits your site.) If there is no activity, it will run when the first activity appears. So the time can be shifted.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

1. the link to the page where the problem occurs
2. the name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.
3. the version of your WordPress installation
4. copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/)

I have a couple sites that have been a headache to keep current. This plugin is just what I needed to automate what is a pretty brainless chore. Lots of custom settings and easy to use. Just set it to “auto” and it’ll check for updates and install them at any frequency you set. With all the hacking going on these days, you can’t be too careful about outdated plugins, themes, and wordpress core files.
