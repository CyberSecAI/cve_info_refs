The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a pre-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting certain router and gateway models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A pre-authentication stack overflow vulnerability exists in the affected NETGEAR products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A stack overflow vulnerability is present. This occurs before authentication, implying the vulnerability can be exploited without prior access to the device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS v3 score of 8.8. Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H). This likely means the attacker could potentially gain full control over the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable NETGEAR device, no privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attack complexity is low (AC:L).

**Affected Products:**
The vulnerability affects the following NETGEAR product models with the mentioned firmware versions:

*   D6200, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.00.24
*   R6700v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.42
*   R6800, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.42
*   R6900v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.42
