## Description

*Allowing your visitors to subscribe to your newsletter should be easy. With this plugin, it finally is.*

This plugins helps you grow your email list in Mailchimp. You can use it to create good looking and accessible sign-up forms or integrate with any other existing form on your WordPress site, like your contact, comment or checkout form.

  + BuddyPress
  + MemberPress
  + Events Manager
  + Easy Digital Downloads
  + Give

* [Mailchimp for WordPress Premium](https://www.mc4wp.com/): Send your WooCommerce orders to Mailchimp so you can see exactly what each subscriber purchased and how much revenue your email campaigns are generating.

  + [Mailchimp Top Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-top-bar/)
  + [Boxzilla Pop-ups](https://wordpress.org/plugins/boxzilla/)
* Well documented through our [knowledge base](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/).
* Developer friendly. For some inspiration, check out our [repository of example code snippets](https://github.com/ibericode/mailchimp-for-wordpress/tree/main/sample-code-snippets).
* Ready for PHP 8.4, but backwards-compatible all the way down to PHP 7.4.

## FAQ

### Where can I find my Mailchimp API key?

You can [find your API key here](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys#Find-or-Generate-Your-API-Key)

### How to display a form in posts or pages?

Use the `[mc4wp_form]` shortcode or the Gutenberg block.

### How to display a form in widget areas like the sidebar or footer?

Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and use the **Mailchimp for WP Form** widget that comes with the plugin.

### How to add a sign-up checkbox to my Contact Form 7 form?

Use the following shortcode in your CF7 form to display a newsletter sign-up checkbox.

```
[mc4wp_checkbox "Subscribe to our newsletter?"]

```

Our knowledge base has more information on [connecting Contact Form 7 and Mailchimp](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/connecting-contact-form-7-and-mailchimp/).

### The form shows a success message but subscribers are not added to my list(s)?

If the form shows a success message, there is no doubt that the sign-up request succeeded. Mailchimp could have a slight delay sending the confirmation email though. Please check again in a few minutes (sometimes hours) and don’t forget to check your junk folder too.

When you have double opt-in disabled, new subscribers will be seen as *imports* by Mailchimp. They will not show up in your daily digest emails or statistics. [We always recommend leaving double opt-in enabled](http://blog.mailchimp.com/double-opt-in-vs-single-opt-in-stats/).

### How can I style the sign-up form?

You can use custom CSS to style the sign-up form if you do not like the themes that come with the plugin. The following selectors can be used to target the various form elements.

```
.mc4wp-form { ... } /* the form element */
.mc4wp-form p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
.mc4wp-form label { ... } /* labels */
.mc4wp-form input { ... } /* input fields */
.mc4wp-form input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
.mc4wp-form input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
.mc4wp-alert { ... } /* success & error messages */
.mc4wp-success { ... } /* success message */
.mc4wp-error { ... } /* error messages */

```

You can add your custom CSS to your theme stylesheet or (easier) by using a plugin like [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=after-css-link)

### How do I show a sign-up form in a pop-up?

We recommend the [Boxzilla pop-up plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/boxzilla/) for this. You can use the form shortcode in your pop-up box to show a sign-up form.

### How do I subscribe from my WooCommerce checkout form?

You can use our WooCommerce integration for that. [How to subscribe to Mailchimp from the WooCommerce checkout form](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/connect-woocommerce-store-mailchimp/).

### How to connect my WooCommerce store with Mailchimp?

You can find instructions for [connecting your WooCommerce store with Mailchimp](https://www.mc4wp.com/kb/connect-woocommerce-store-mailchimp/) on our website.

### I’m getting an “HTTP Error” when trying to connect to Mailchimp.

the “HTTP Error” type is usually because of a firewall configuration issue or outdated software on your web server.

Please contact your webhost and ask them to check the following:

* Whether remote HTTP requests to `https://api.mailchimp.com` are allowed.
* Whether cURL and the PHP-cURL extension are installed and updated to a recent version.

If a plugin is made for WordPress, then it should solve the problem and automate processes, and not add new tasks, and after all the settings it still does not work – my rating is 0, study the hardware.

This damn plugin has wasted me so much time to get to work. Fields just won’t get populated in email sends, and don’t get populated into Mailchimp. I literally have to spend HOURS trying to figure things out just for this stupid lame plugin. I would give this thing negative 1000 stars if possible. Stay far far away from this piece of junk.
And the authors don’t respond to any questions either. Lame waste of time.

Not user friendly. I wanted to make a form but the design was broken, you have to do a lot of work even to add CSS. It’s 2024, drag and drop shouldn’t be this hard
