  "CVE-2017-18364": {
    "Description": "Multiple reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in phpFK lite version. Several parameters in different PHP files are vulnerable to XSS attacks, including query strings and GET/POST parameters.",
    "Root cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code into web pages.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to stealing cookies, session hijacking, defacement of the website, and phishing attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Manipulating query strings in URLs",
      "Submitting crafted GET requests",
      "Submitting crafted POST requests"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click a manipulated link or to interact with the vulnerable application in a way that injects malicious code through unsanitized input parameters. The attacker does not need to have an account or authenticated access.",
    "Affected parameters": [
        "/faq.php (Query Based)",
        "/members.php (Query Based)",
        "/members.php (search - GET)",
        "/members.php (search - POST)",
        "/search.php (Query Based)",
