- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Crowd Demo application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can modify, add, and delete users and groups.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through CSRF attacks. An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when executed by an authenticated user, will perform actions on the Crowd application without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into executing a malicious request, typically through a link or embedded content. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
