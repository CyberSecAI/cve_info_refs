This document describes a post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability affecting certain Netgear devices.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Post-authentication buffer overflow:** The vulnerability can be exploited after successful authentication to the device.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to High impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. The CVSS v3 score is 6.8.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is Adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker must be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the target device.
*   The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the affected device. This is a post-authentication vulnerability.
*   The exploit requires low complexity (AC:L) and no user interaction (UI:N).
*   The attacker needs High privileges (PR:H) to perform the attack.
**Affected Devices and Firmware:**
*   R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.36
*   PLW1000v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.14
*   PLW1010v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.14
