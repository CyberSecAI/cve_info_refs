The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in their R6700v2 and R6800 router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which means the vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input that is then reflected back to the user, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts. The advisory doesn't specify the exact vulnerable parameter or location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the user interface
    *   Phishing attempts, possibly leading to credential theft
    *   Other malicious actions within the user's session with the router

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code. The user must click a malicious link for the attack to succeed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to click the link. The attacker does not require a privileged position on the network. The attack is performed via the user's browser and is initiated by a user clicking the malicious link.

**Additional details:**
* The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 1.1.0.42 and later for both affected models.
* The advisory provides instructions to download and install the new firmware.
* It also provides a CVSS v3 score of 6.1 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L, which indicates a medium severity vulnerability that has a low attack complexity but requires a user interaction to be exploited.
* The advisory is associated with PSV-2017-2162 but is not associated with any specific CVE.
