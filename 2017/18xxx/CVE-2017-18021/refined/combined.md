Hi folks,

"QtPass" is a separate project entirely from pass. It shares no code
with password store. However, the developer of "QtPass" hangs out on
this list, is part of the greater pass community, and "QtPass" is in
fact compatible and made to work with pass. Given the grave nature of
a recent software vulnerability in "QtPass", I feel like it might be
responsible to inform this list about it, in case there are any users
of this third party software here, despite it not actually being
related to the development of password store.

Bug report is here: <https://github.com/IJHack/QtPass/issues/338>
Fix landed in v1.2.1: <https://github.com/IJHack/QtPass/releases/tag/v1.2.1>

All passwords generated with "QtPass"'s built-in password generator
are possibly predictable and enumerable by hackers. The generator used
libc's random(), seeded with srand(msecs), where msecs is not the
msecs since 1970 (not that that'd be secure anyway), but rather the
msecs since the last second. This means there are only 1000 different
sequences of generated passwords.

If you're using this software, now would be a good time to change all
your passwords and regenerate them using a secure utility such as pass
(what this mailing list is about), or update to the latest version of
this third party "QtPass" software and regenerate from there. The fix
I proposed to the "QtPass" developers involves using Qt 5.10's
built-in CSPRNG wrapper, or /dev/urandom for older Qt versions.

Regards,
Jason

## Description

[![@zx2c4](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10643?v=4&size=48)](/zx2c4)[zx2c4](https://github.com/zx2c4)opened [on Dec 22, 2017](https://github.com/IJHack/QtPass/issues/338#issue-284205242)

The current way of generating passwords is insecure. All passwords that have been generated with QtPass in the past must be regenerated and changed.

Here is the current password generation function:

```
      for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        int index = Util::rand() % charset.length();
        QChar nextChar = charset.at(index);
        passwd.append(nextChar);
      }
```

The problem here is that modulo will not uniformly distribute that set. The proper way to do things is to just throw away values that are out of bounds. You *could* try to do the calculation correctly to uniformly stretch or compress, but it's hard to get right, so it's best to just discard numbers outside the set and try again.

Secondly, and more critically, here is the implementation of `Util::rand`:

```
...
  qsrand(static_cast<uint>(QTime::currentTime().msec()));
...
int Util::rand() {
#ifdef Q_OS_WIN
  quint32 ret = 0;
  if (FAILED(BCryptGenRandom(NULL, (PUCHAR)&ret, sizeof(ret),
                             BCRYPT_USE_SYSTEM_PREFERRED_RNG)))
    return qrand();
  return ret % RAND_MAX;
#else
  return qrand();
#endif
}
```

Unfortunately, using a non-cryptographically secure random number generator like libc's `rand()` is problematic -- future outputs can be derived from knowing only a handful of past outputs -- and seeding that deterministic rng with `currentTime()->msec()` is even more dangerous. Not only is the current time a guessable/bruteforcable parameter, but the documentation for `QTime::msec` actually indicates that this is merely the "[the millisecond part (0 to 999) of the time](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-5.9/qtime.html#msec)", which means there are only 1000 possibilities of generated sequences of passwords.

This is as bad as it gets, in terms of password manager password generation.

The proper fix is to use Qt 5.10's [`QRandomGenerator::system()`](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt5-dev/qrandomgenerator.html#system). If 5.10 is not available to you, [use `/dev/urandom` on Mac/Linux and `RtlGenRandom` on Windows](https://paragonie.com/blog/2016/05/how-generate-secure-random-numbers-in-various-programming-languages).

---

The password generator inside pass(1) itself is implemented like this:

```
read -r -n $length pass < <(LC_ALL=C tr -dc "$characters" < /dev/urandom)
```

* uses /dev/urandom
* discards characters that aren't part of the set

# QtPass 1.4.0

QtPass is a multi-platform GUI for [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/ "pass, the standard unix password manager"), the standard unix password manager.

## GUI for pass, the standard UNIX password manager

QtPass is part of the [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org) ecosystem. This means you are not stuck with QtPass, you can use the same password store with [many clients](https://www.passwordstore.org/#other).

Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy. With `pass`, each password lives inside of a `gpg` encrypted file whose filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the password.
These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies, copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard command line file management utilities.

Contrary to many Free, Libre and OpenSource password managers, pass and by extension QtPass are not bound to one user or device. Since we are based on GnuPG we have multi-key, multi recipient encryption out of the box.
The use of external encryption devices like OpenPGP or x509/CMS based smartcards or USB tokens and per-folder ACL makes it easy to grant or take away privileges from users.

## Insecure Password Generation prior to 1.2.1

All passwords generated with QtPass' built-in password generator prior to 1.2.1 are possibly predictable and enumerable by hackers.

The generator used libc's random(), seeded with srand(msecs), where msecs is not the
msecs since 1970 (not that that'd be secure anyway), but rather the
msecs since the last second. This means there are only 1000 different
sequences of generated passwords.

Read more about this [issue](https://github.com/IJHack/QtPass/issues/338 "QtPass Insecure Password Generation") on [Github](https://github.com/IJHack/QtPass/issues/338 "QtPass Insecure Password Generation").

Please note that this is an issue with the QtPass GUI and not in pass or the greater password-store ecosystem.

We advice to [update to 1.2.1 or later](/downloads) as soon as possible and change any password you may have generated with the QtPass' password generator.

Latest stable on the [releases page](https://github.com/IJHack/QtPass/releases "QtPass MacOs releases"), latest build via [AnneJan](https://annejan.com/media/qtpass.php "QtPass OSX builds").

Via [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask "brew install qtpass")
```
brew install qtpass --cask
```
### Dependencies

* QtPass requires Qt 5.2 or later.
* The Linguist package is required to compile the translations.
* For use of the fallback icons the SVG library is required.

On most \*nix systems all you need is:

```
qmake && make && make install
```

On Mac OS X:

```
brew install qt5
brew link --overwrite --force qt5
xcode-select --install
qmake && make && macdeployqt QtPass.app
```
## Security considerations

Using this program will not magically keep your passwords secure against
compromised computers even if you use it in combination with a smartcard.

It does protect future and changed passwords though against anyone with access to
your password store only but not your keys.
Used with a smartcard it also protects against anyone just monitoring/copying
all files/keystrokes on that machine and such an attacker would only gain access
to the passwords you actually use.
Once you plug in your smartcard and enter your PIN (or due to CVE-2015-3298
even without your PIN) all your passwords available to the machine can be
decrypted by it, if there is malicious software targeted specifically against
it installed (or at least one that knows how to use a smartcard).

To get better protection out of use with a smartcard even against a targeted
attack I can think of at least two options:

* The smartcard must require explicit confirmation for each decryption operation.
  Or if it just provides a counter for decrypted data you could at least notice
  an attack afterwards, though at quite some effort on your part.
* Use a different smartcard for each (group of) key.
* If using a YubiKey or U2F module or similar that requires a "button" press for
  other authentication methods you can use one OTP/U2F enabled WebDAV account per
  password (or groups of passwords) as a quite inconvenient workaround.
  Unfortunately I do not know of any WebDAV service with OTP support except ownCloud
  (so you would have to run your own server).

## Planned features

* Plugins based on key, format is same as password file.
* Colour coding folders (possibly disabling folders you can't decrypt).
* Optional table view of decrypted folder contents.
* Opening of (basic auth) urls in default browser? Possibly with helper plugin for filling out forms?
* WebDAV (configuration) support.
* Other forms of remote storage that allows for accountability / auditing (web API to retreive the .gpg files)?
* Refactoring [MainWindow](/docs/class_main_window.html#a8b244be8b7b7db1b08de2a2acb9409db "MainWindow.cpp MainWindow.h") class.

## Known issues

* Filtering (searching) breaks the tree/model sometimes.

## FAQ

### Can't save a password

* Is folder initialised? Easiest way is to use the [Users] button and make sure you can encrypt for someone (eg. yourself)
* Are you using git? If not, make sure it is switched off.

### I have an issue with GNOME keyring

* Disable GNOME keyring
* Create a `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` containing:

```
enable-ssh-support
write-env-file
use-standard-socket
default-cache-ttl 600
max-cache-ttl 7200
```

Also, the following is useful to add to your .bashrc if you are using Yubikey NEO on Ubuntu:

```
# OpenPGP applet support for YubiKey NEO
if [ ! -f /tmp/gpg-agent.env ]; then
  killall gpg-agent;
  eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support > /tmp/gpg-agent.env);
fi
. /tmp/gpg-agent.env
```

### Can I import from KeePass, LastPass or X?

* Yes, check [passwordstore.org/#migration](https://www.passwordstore.org/#migration) for more info.

### Are there more frequently asked questions?

* Read the current [QtPass FAQ](/docs/md__f_a_q.html "Frequently Asked Questions") and [documentation on contributing](docs/md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g.html "Developer information").
* Read the [whitepaper (pdf)](https://annejan.com/media/qtpass.pdf).

### Where can I ask for help?

* Create an [issue](https://github.com/IJHack/QtPass/issues "QtPass issue queue") issues on github.
* Send an email to help@qtpass.org
