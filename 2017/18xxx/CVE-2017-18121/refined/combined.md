Debian Bug     : 889286

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in SimpleSAMLphp, a
framework for authentication, primarily via the SAML protocol.

CVE-2017-12867

     Attackers with access to a secret token could extend its validity
     period by manipulating the prepended time offset.

CVE-2017-12869

    When using the multiauth module, attackers can bypass authentication
    context restrictions and use any authentication source defined in
    the config.

CVE-2017-12873

    Defensive measures have been taken to prevent the administrator
    from misconfiguring persistent NameIDs to avoid identifier clash.
    (Affects Debian 8 Jesse only.)

CVE-2017-12874

    The InfoCard module could accept incorrectly signed XML messages
    in rare occasions.

CVE-2017-18121

    The consentAdmin module was vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting
    attack, allowing an attacker to craft links that could execute
     arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

CVE-2017-18122

    The (deprecated) SAML 1.1 implementation would regard as valid any
    unsigned SAML response containing more than one signed assertion,
    provided that the signature of at least one of the assertions was
    valid, allowing an attacker that could obtain a valid signed
    assertion from an IdP to impersonate users from that IdP.

CVE-2018-6519

    Regular expression denial of service when parsing extraordinarily
    long timestamps.

CVE-2018-6521

    Change sqlauth module MySQL charset from utf8 to utf8mb to
    prevent theoretical query truncation that could allow remote
    attackers to bypass intended access restrictions

SSPSA-201802-01 (no CVE yet)

    Critical signature validation vulnerability.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.13.1-2+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.14.11-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.

# 201709-01

**Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in the consentAdmin module**

### Background

The *consentAdmin* module is an addition to the *consent* module that allows users to view and manage the consent given
to send attributes to third-party services. Users of an Identity Provider can leverage this module to keep track of what
attributes are sent to what services, and withdraw any existing consent.

### Description

A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) issue has been found in the *consentAdmin* module, allowing an attacker to manually craft
links that a victim can open, executing arbitrary javascript code.

The module exposes one single page where users can view and withdraw all consents given to services to retrieve their
attributes. This page includes a link that allows users to log out and terminate their session. The way this link was
built, the current URL as observed by the server was used, with an additional parameter that starts the logout process.
Since the URL was not properly sanitised, a malicious third party can build a URL that includes Javascript code that
will be executed by the victimâ€™s web browser.

This issue has been fixed by ignoring the current URL and building the link manually to point to the current page with
the additional parameter that is needed to start the logout process.

### Affected versions

All **SimpleSAMLphp** versions before and including **1.14.15**.

### Impact

When the *consentAdmin* module is enabled and configured in an Identity Provider, an attacker can leverage this issue
to manually craft URLs that include Javascript code executed by the victimâ€™s web browser.

### Resolution

Upgrade to the [latest version](/download). When an upgrade is not possible immediately, the *consentAdmin* module
should be disabled until the upgrade can be performed.

Package        : simplesamlphp
Version        : 1.9.2-1+deb7u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-18121 CVE-2017-18122 CVE-2018-6521
Debian Bug     : 889286

simplesamlphp, an authentication and federation application has been
found vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS), signature validation
byepass and using insecure connection charset.

CVE-2017-18121

    A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) issue has been found in the
    consentAdmin module of SimpleSAMLphp through 1.14.15, allowing an
    attacker to manually craft links that a victim can open, executing
    arbitrary javascript code.

CVE-2017-18122

    A signature-validation bypass issue was discovered in SimpleSAMLphp
    through 1.14.16. Service Provider using SAML 1.1 will regard as
    valid any unsigned SAML response containing more than one signed
    assertion, provided that the signature of at least one of the
    assertions is valid. Attributes contained in all the assertions
    received will be merged and the entityID of the first assertion
    received will be used, allowing an attacker to impersonate any user
    of any IdP given an assertion signed by the targeted IdP.

CVE-2018-6521

    The sqlauth module in SimpleSAMLphp before 1.15.2 relies on the
    MySQL utf8 charset, which truncates queries upon encountering
    four-byte characters. There might be a scenario in which this allows
    remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1.9.2-1+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.
