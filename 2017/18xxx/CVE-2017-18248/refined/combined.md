Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : cups
Version        : 1.7.5-11+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-18190 CVE-2017-18248

Two vulnerabilities affecting the cups printing server were found
which can lead to arbitrary IPP command execution and denial of
service.

CVE-2017-18190

    A localhost.localdomain whitelist entry in valid_host() in
    scheduler/client.c in CUPS before 2.2.2 allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary IPP commands by sending POST requests to the
    CUPS daemon in conjunction with DNS rebinding. The
    localhost.localdomain name is often resolved via a DNS server
    (neither the OS nor the web browser is responsible for ensuring
    that localhost.localdomain is 127.0.0.1).

CVE-2017-18248

    The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in CUPS before 2.2.6, when
    D-Bus support is enabled, can be crashed by remote attackers by
    sending print jobs with an invalid username, related to a D-Bus
    notification.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.7.5-11+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# USN-3713-1: CUPS vulnerabilities

11 July 2018

Several security issues were fixed in CUPS.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [cups](/security/cves?package=cups) - Common UNIX Printing System(tm)

## Details

It was discovered that CUPS incorrectly handled certain print jobs with

invalid usernames. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

CUPS to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 17.10 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-18248](/security/CVE-2017-18248))

Dan Bastone discovered that the CUPS dnssd backend incorrectly handled

certain environment variables. A local attacker could possibly use this

issue to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2018-4180](/security/CVE-2018-4180))

Eric Rafaloff and John Dunlap discovered that CUPS incorrectly handled

certain include directives. A local attacker could possibly use this issue

to read arbitrary files. ([CVE-2018-4181](/security/CVE-2018-4181))

Dan Bastone discovered that the CUPS AppArmor profile incorrectly confined

the dnssd backend. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to escape

confinement. ([CVE-2018-6553](/security/CVE-2018-6553))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [cups](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cups)
  -
  [2.2.7-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cups/2.2.7-1ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [cups](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cups)
  -
  [2.2.4-7ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cups/2.2.4-7ubuntu3.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [cups](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cups)
  -
  [2.1.3-4ubuntu0.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cups/2.1.3-4ubuntu0.5)

Version        : 1.5.3-5+deb7u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-18248

CVE-2017-18248
   It was found that by submitting a print job with an invalid username,
   the CUPS server can be crashed, when D-Bus support is enabled (which
   is the case for Debian).

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1.5.3-5+deb7u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.

# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

* [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

## Description

[![@jsmeix](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788608?u=925fc54e2ce01551392622446ece427f51e2f0ce&v=4&size=48)](/jsmeix)[jsmeix](https://github.com/jsmeix)opened [on Oct 16, 2017](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5143#issue-265733838)

Any user who can submit a print job to a CUPS server

can abort the cupsd running on the CUPS server by

submitting a job as a user with an invalid username.

I tested it with CUPS 1.7.5 and also the newest 2.2.5

so that I assume the issue is old and not fixed.

I think this issue here has the same root cause as

[#4748](https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/4748)

As far as I see the fix there belongs to the LPD mini daemon

but this issue here belongs to the cupsd.

How to reproduce:

On a (Linux) client system create a user with an

invalid username - I use 'binÃ¤r' as username that has

the character Ã¤ (Latin small letter a with diaeresis,

i.e. the German a-umlaut) encoded in ISO-8859-1

encoding so that the username in hex byte values is

```
62 69 6e e4 72

```

Usually one cannot create such a username with "useradd"

(because it rejects invalid usernames) so that one must

manually edit /etc/passwd.

Then as this user submit a print job from the client system

to a (possibly remote) CUPS server.

The cupsd on the CUPS server will bet aborted

inside a D-Bus library call that sends SIGABRT

which aborts the whole caller process.

In /var/log/messages or nowadays in the "journalctl" output

one gets things like

```
