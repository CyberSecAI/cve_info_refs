- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Jira-importers-plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized actions through manipulated requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Creation of new projects.
    - Aborting an ongoing external system import process.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the CSRF vulnerabilities by crafting malicious web pages or links that, when visited by an authenticated user, execute unwanted actions on the Jira instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to trick an authenticated user of the vulnerable Jira instance into visiting a malicious webpage or clicking a malicious link.
    - No direct access to the Jira server or credentials is required.
