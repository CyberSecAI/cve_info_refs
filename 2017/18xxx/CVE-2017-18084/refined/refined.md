Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when rendering the description of a macro within the `usermacros` resource.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the web page.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser session when they view a page containing a crafted macro. This could potentially lead to:
        * **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
        * **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or available in the user's session.
        * **Malicious actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge, such as modifying content, adding new users, or deleting data.
        * **Redirecting to malicious pages:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website to phish their credentials or infect them with malware.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * The attack vector is through the description of a user-defined macro. A malicious actor can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code within this description.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a macro description within the Confluence Server instance. This typically requires user level access to the Confluence application. They don't require any special position on the network.
    * The attacker must be able to convince a user to view the page containing this crafted macro.

**Versions Affected:**
* Atlassian Confluence Server versions prior to 6.3.4

**Versions Fixed:**
* Atlassian Confluence Server versions 6.3.4 and 6.4.0
