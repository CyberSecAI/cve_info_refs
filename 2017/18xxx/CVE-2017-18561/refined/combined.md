this plugin solved my 2 problems; my wordpress ignores the img tag in comment textbox. editing php could solve this but it was quite tricky to me. and not-html-friendly visitor felt difficult to use img tag. and other problem was that I didn‚Äôt have enough traffic & storage. so I used other image hosting service(like imgur, etc) and linked to img tag manually,, but now I just need to paste link. nice.
