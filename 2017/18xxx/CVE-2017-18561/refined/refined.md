The provided content discusses the "Embed Images in Comments" WordPress plugin. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2017-18561, it does mention a fix for an XSS vulnerability in the changelog.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Weakness:**  The plugin was not properly sanitizing or escaping user-provided image links before embedding them into the comments section.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a comment. When other users viewed the comment, the malicious script would execute within their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other attacks.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the comments section.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to post a comment containing a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin's changelog specifically mentions that Gennady Kovshenin found and fixed the XSS vulnerability in version 0.6.
*   The comments section shows a user stating "Plugin contains a security issue. Do not use right now." which suggests the vulnerability was known before the fix.
