**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the ReadyNAS OS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts can be injected into the ReadyNAS system and stored there. When other users interact with the affected areas, these scripts can be executed in their browsers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is rated as Medium, with a CVSS v3 score of 5.2.
- Exploitation can lead to:
    - Loss of confidentiality (C:L)
    - Loss of integrity (I:L)
    - Loss of availability (A:L)
    - Arbitrary script execution in the context of a user's browser
    - Session hijacking
    - Phishing attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable locally.
- An attacker can inject malicious script through a vulnerable input field or other storage mechanism.
- A user with administrative access is required to trigger the stored XSS vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have high privileges (PR:H) to inject the malicious code.
- User interaction (UI:R) is required to trigger the execution of the script by a different user.

**Affected devices:**
All ReadyNAS OS 6 devices running ReadyNAS OS versions prior to 6.8.0 are affected. The document includes a detailed list of affected models.

**Mitigation:**
- Update the ReadyNAS OS to version 6.8.0 or later.
