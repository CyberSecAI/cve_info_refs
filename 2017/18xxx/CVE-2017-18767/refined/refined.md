The provided content is related to a post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR routers and gateways, but it does not mention CVE-2017-18767. Instead, it references **PSV-2017-0320** as the security advisory identifier.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Command Injection: An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system through a vulnerability in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device, potentially allowing an attacker to control it remotely, steal data, or use it as a pivot point for further attacks. The advisory mentions the impact as high in its CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Network access, specifically after authentication with valid credentials.
* Web interface: The vulnerability resides within the web interface of the affected devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the web interface of the vulnerable device. Thus, this is a post-authentication vulnerability, meaning the attacker must have already obtained valid access or be an authorized user of the device.

**Affected Devices and Firmware:**
The following NETGEAR routers and gateways are affected if running firmware versions prior to the ones mentioned:
* D7800 (prior to 1.0.1.34)
* D8500 (prior to 1.0.3.39)
* R6400 (prior to 1.0.1.14)
* R6400v2 (prior to 1.0.2.32)
* R6700 (prior to 1.0.1.22)
* R6900 (prior to 1.0.1.22)

* R7300 (prior to 1.0.0.56)
* R7800 (prior to 1.0.2.36)
* R7900 (prior to 1.0.2.10)
* R8000 (prior to 1.0.3.24)
* R8300 (prior to 1.0.2.74)
* R8500 (prior to 1.0.2.74)

**CVSS v3 Rating:**
* High
* Score: 6.8
* Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
*  AV:A (Adjacent)
*  AC:L (Low)
*  PR:H (High privileges required)
*  UI:N (No user interaction required)
*  S:U (Unchanged)
*  C:H (High impact to confidentiality)
*  I:H (High impact to integrity)
*  A:H (High impact to availability)
