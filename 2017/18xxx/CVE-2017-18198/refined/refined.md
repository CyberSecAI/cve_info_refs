      "cve": "CVE-2017-18198",
      "description": "A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `print_iso9660_recurse` function within `iso-info.c` of GNU libcdio before version 1.0.0. This flaw can be exploited by an attacker who crafts a malicious ISO file and tricks an application using libcdio into processing it. This can result in a denial of service due to a crash.",
      "affected_component": "libcdio library",
      "root_cause": "Heap-based buffer over-read in the `print_iso9660_recurse` function.",
      "vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer over-read, leading to potential memory corruption.",
      "impact": "Denial of service due to application crash.",
      "attack_vector": "Processing of a crafted ISO file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create or provide a malicious ISO file.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking while processing ISO files which leads to a heap buffer over-read. This can be exploited by an attacker who crafts a malicious ISO file to cause a crash when processed."

      "cve": "CVE-2017-18199",
      "description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was discovered in the `realloc_symlink` function in `rock.c` of GNU libcdio before version 1.0.0. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted ISO file that triggers the NULL pointer dereference when processed by an application that utilizes libcdio, causing a denial of service due to a crash.",

      "attack_vector": "Processing of a crafted ISO file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create or provide a malicious ISO file.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the realloc_symlink function, a component of Rock Ridge extensions handling where a crafted ISO file can trigger a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash."

      "cve": "CVE-2017-18201",
      "description": "A double-free vulnerability exists in the `get_cdtext_generic()` function within `lib/driver/_cdio_generic.c` in GNU libcdio before version 2.0.0. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash) by tricking a user into processing a crafted ISO file.",
