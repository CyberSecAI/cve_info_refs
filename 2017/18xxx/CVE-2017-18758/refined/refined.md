Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2017-18758.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a post-authentication stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the affected Netgear routers. This vulnerability can be exploited after a user has authenticated with the router.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected router. This could potentially lead to a complete compromise of the device, allowing the attacker to control the router, access the network, or conduct other malicious activities. The CVSS v3 score of 8.8 indicates a high level of severity due to the potential impact of this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent, which indicates that the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the affected device to perform an attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker must have already authenticated to the affected device to exploit this vulnerability. Since the authentication is a precondition for exploiting this vulnerability, it indicates that an attacker needs to have a valid user credential or be able to perform authentication bypass first.
The attacker must be present on the same network as the target router.

**Affected products:**
- R6700v2 (firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.42)
- R6800 (firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.42)
- R6900v2 (firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.42)
