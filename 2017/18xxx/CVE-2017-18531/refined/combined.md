## Description

Raygun keeps a watchful eye on your website and notifies you of problems as they arise.

Signup for a [free trial](https://app.raygun.com/signup) of Raygun today.

**Crash Reporting**

[Raygun Crash Reporting](https://raygun.com/platform/crash-reporting) silently monitors your software and notifies you when users encounter errors. Crash Reporting also provides deep diagnostic information about the root cause of the error or crash, meaning your team won’t be losing valuable time digging through log files.

Using this plugin, you can enable crash reporting to track errors and exceptions generated by your WordPress site.

**Real User Monitoring**

Ensure your website delivers a flawless user experience using [Raygun Real User Monitoring](https://raygun.com/platform/real-user-monitoring). Monitor the performance of every user session so you can make improvements. Measure how geographic location affects your user experience by viewing detailed breakdowns. Increase user retention by discovering the problematic pages your users get stuck on.

Using this plugin, you can enable real user monitoring to track individual user sessions, asset load times and more about your WordPress site.

**Customers**

Customers are why we create software. See them all, what they do, and how they’re impacted by errors, crashes, and performance issues when using your software applications. Raygun Customers gives you complete clarity on who is using your application, alongside any problems they encountered that negatively impacted their end-user experience. Understand what actions led to an issue occurring and whether the overall experience was good or bad for individual users. Customers is included in all Raygun plans and can be set up quickly by enabling it in your plugin settings.

## Installation

1. Download and activate the Raygun Plugin from your WordPress admin panel.
2. Visit the Raygun plugin **About** page.
3. Follow the steps under *Get Started Today*.

## FAQ

### How do I enable Real User Monitoring

As of 1.8.0, you can enable [real user monitoring](https://raygun.com/platform/real-user-monitoring) by navigating to the Raygun settings page and checking the **Enable Real User Monitoring** checkbox.

User information will be sent alongside RUM sessions if you have the Customers feature enabled.

### How do I use Customers?

When enabled, the currently logged in user’s email address, first name and last name will be transmitted with each error or session. This will be visible in the Raygun dashboard. If this feature is not enabled, a random ID will be assigned to each user.

### What does my WordPress site require to use this plugin?

This plugin automates the installation of [Raygun4PHP](https://raygun.com/documentation/language-guides/php), the PHP provider for Raygun.

The server that your WordPress site runs on requires a **PHP 7.4** or newer environment. This also requires that your WordPress version be at least 5.3.

### Multisite Support

This plugin is not guaranteed to work with multisite installations in certain environments. The following procedure should first be followed on a staging server that matches your production environment as closely as possible **before** being replicated live. It is recommended to use the most recent version WordPress and PHP.

1. On your root network site, install the plugin using the Admin dashboard’s Plugin page as standard, but do not activate it.
2. FTP in and modify wp-content/plugins/raygun4wp/raygun4wp.php – change the value on *line 16* ($multisite\_support\_enabled) to **true**.
3. Visit the Admin dashboard of a child site (not the root network site). Go to its Plugin page, and you should see Raygun ready to be activated – do so.
4. A new Raygun submenu will be added to the left sidebar. There, you may click on Settings, paste in your API key, and save changes. You can now click Send Test Error and confirm that it appears in your Raygun dashboard.
5. Repeat the above process for any other child sites – you can use different API keys (to send to different Raygun applications) or the same one.

Finally, if you so desire, you should be able to visit the root network site, activate it there and configure it. You must, however, activate it on at least one child site first.

Tried to activate this plugin on our website, hosted with Pagely, and it immediately crashed the server.
An error of type E\_COMPILE\_ERROR was caused in line 168 of the file /dom34643/wp-content/plugins/raygun4wp/main.php. Error message: require\_once(): Failed opening required '/dom34643/wp-content/plugins/raygun4wp/external/raygun4php/src/Raygun4php/RaygunClient.php' (include\_path='.:/usr/share/php')
