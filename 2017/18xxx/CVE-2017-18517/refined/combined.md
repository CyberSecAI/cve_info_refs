Title says it all. Thing spans the width of the screen, and about 1/4 screen vertically.
Thought this was against WP.org’s rules. Thankfully, plugin Shortcode Finder makes it dirt easy to get the list of pages where this particular dev’s shortcodes appear. Replacing each with the Pinterest Widget Builder’s (free) coding. I’ll then unload this thing.
Devs don’t get it- when you resort to spam, you tell us how insecure you are about your product’s inherent ability to pull the sale.
No need for response. You’ve had your say in my Admin area, soon to be cured.

I’m using the bridge theme and it doesn’t work on the portfolio items – which is where I need it most 🙁
Otherwise, good.

I LOVE this plugin! It’s easy to use; I quickly added pin it buttons to all my images by adjusting the settings. It will undoubtedly help drive traffic to my site!
