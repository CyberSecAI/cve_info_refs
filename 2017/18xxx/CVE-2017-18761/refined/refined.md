- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the Netgear R8000 router.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise, as indicated by the high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network segment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) and no user interaction (UI:N) is required for successful exploitation. The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
