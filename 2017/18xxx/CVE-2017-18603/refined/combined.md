Like many others, I had to replace postman as it stopped working, just found out it has been updated under a new name:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/
(I followed the review request link in the new plugin and ended up here and thought I should share these pieces of information!)

O único que resolveu o meu problema em relação aos e-mails do Woocommerce estarem indo para o Spam dos meus clientes. Após instalar e configurar o plugin, os e-mails imediatamente começaram a ir para a caixa de entrada do cliente! Simples, fácil e muito funcional! PERFEITO!!

There have been no updates to this plugin in several years. I am concerned about the security of it on my wordpress sites. The developer does not seem to respond to support requests. The last response seems to be from 1 year ago.

WordPress Plugin Postman SMTP Mailer/Email Log is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks. WordPress Plugin Postman SMTP Mailer/Email Log version 1.7.2 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised or disable the plugin until a fix is available.

# Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Postman SMTP

We recently found the the plugin [Postman SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/) contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

On line 346 of the file /Postman/Postman-Email-Log/PostmanEmailLogController.php the value of GET or POST input “page” is output without being escaped:

```
value="<?php echo $_REQUEST['page'] ?>" />
```

While the GET input “page” needs to be set to “postman\_email\_log” for that code to run, the POST input can be set to another value and depending on the configuration of PHP will be the one chosen to be output.

The website of the developer is down and we couldn’t find any other method to contact them directly. The plugin was last updated 16 months ago and is only listed as being compatible up to WordPress 4.4, so it doesn’t look like it is being maintained at this time.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will cause any available cookies to be shown in alert box. Major web browsers other than Firefox provide XSS filtering, so this proof of concept will not work in those web browsers.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/tools.php?page=postman_email_log" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="page" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

   Hi,

   Thank you for disclosing this vulnerability. This morning I was able to contact “Postman SMTP” developer, Jason Hendriks –although it was not an easy task ;)–. He was not aware of the fact his plugin had recently been removed from the official WordPress plugins directory. He said he would take a look.

   One more thing, would this be a good fix?

     The recommended WordPress escaping function for where the value is being output in this situation is [esc\_attr()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_attr/).

    Someone named Yehuda Hassine has uploaded a fixed version in GitHub (<https://github.com/yehudah/Postman-SMTP>).

    I can see he has modified the following files:

    • /Postman-Auth/PostmanGoogleAuthenticationManager.php

    • /Postman-Auth/PostmanMicrosoftAuthenticationManager.php

    • /Postman-Auth/PostmanYahooAuthenticationManager.php

    • /Postman-Email-Log/PostmanEmailLogController.php

    • /Postman-Email-Log/PostmanEmailLogService.php

    • /PostmanAjaxController.php

    • /PostmanUtils.php

    He has used FILTER\_SANITIZE\_STRING and intval.

    BIG NEWS!

    The fork (fixed version of “Postman SMTP Mailer/Email Log”) by Yehuda Hassine (props to him!) has got approved in the WordPress Directory. Fortunately, in the end, “Postman SMTP Mailer/Email Log” is going to survive, under the name of “Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log”. You can find it in <https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/>.

    The Github repo has been moved here: <https://github.com/yehudah/Post-SMTP>.

    Long life to Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log!

    Thank you @yehudah!
