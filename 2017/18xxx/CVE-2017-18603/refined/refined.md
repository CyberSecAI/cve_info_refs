Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-18603 (Based on the content, this CVE is associated with the identified vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the "page" parameter within the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin outputs the value of the `page` parameter from the GET or POST request without proper escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the HTML, which is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Cookie Stealing:**  The injected script can steal cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
*  **Further Attacks:** Stolen cookies can facilitate further attacks on the compromised website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious `page` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers could potentially trick users into clicking malicious links or submitting forms containing the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **User Interaction (Potentially):** While a direct POST request can trigger the vulnerability, attackers might utilize social engineering to trick users into submitting the malicious request.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know that the `page` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerable code is located in `/Postman/Postman-Email-Log/PostmanEmailLogController.php` on line 346.
* The plugin was closed and is not available for download due to this issue.
* A fixed version of the plugin is available under a new name "Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log" at `https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/`.
* The fixed version sanitizes the input using functions like `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` and `intval`.
* The vulnerability was present in version 1.7.2 of the plugin and possibly earlier versions.
*  The recommended fix is to use the `esc_attr()` function from WordPress to sanitize the output.
