Needed something that I as a dev and our clients could manage custom fields for specific types of content, and this plug-in proved to be exactly what I was looking for. Easy to set up, clean UI, easy to style on the backend. Leaves some want for customizing the UI for writers (size of text boxes and areas; easier implementation of s and <p> in boxes), but no the less, met our needs.
