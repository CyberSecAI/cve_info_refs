The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a post-authentication buffer overflow in the firmware of specific NETGEAR router models.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists, meaning that a process can write data beyond the allocated buffer which can corrupt the memory, leading to crashes or code execution.
- **Post-authentication:** The vulnerability is only exploitable after an attacker has successfully authenticated to the router.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High impact**:  The CVSS v3 score is 6.8 which is considered High.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** The vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the router with impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Adjacent:** The attack vector is "Adjacent" meaning that the attacker needs to be within the same network to exploit this vulnerability, like connected to the same Wifi network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to exploit this vulnerability meaning they must have successfully authenticated to the router.

**Affected Products:**
- R8300, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.106
- R8500, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.106
