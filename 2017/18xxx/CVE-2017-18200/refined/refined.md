{
  "Root cause": "The function `f2fs_wait_discard_bios` was being used in contexts other than `f2fs_put_super`. This function was designed to be called only during `put_super` because it ignores discard entry's reference count when removing the entry. When called from other contexts, it could lead to a race condition where other threads increment the reference count of the discard entry while `f2fs_wait_discard_bios` attempts to remove it, resulting in a `bug_on` failure within the `__remove_discard_cmd`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Race condition due to improper reference counting of discard entries.",
    "Incorrect usage of `f2fs_wait_discard_bios` function outside of its intended context (`f2fs_put_super`)."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Kernel panic (BUG())",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Calling `fstrim` manually (e.g., via a cronjob)",
    "Garbage collection (GC) loops with specific time configurations."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger fstrim operations or induce specific garbage collection behavior."
