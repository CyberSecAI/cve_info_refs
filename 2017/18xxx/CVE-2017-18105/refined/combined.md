### Description

The console login resource in Atlassian Crowd before version 3.0.2 and from version 3.1.0 before version 3.1.1 allows remote attackers, who have previously obtained a user's JSESSIONID cookie, to gain access to some of the built-in and potentially third party rest resources via a session fixation vulnerability.
