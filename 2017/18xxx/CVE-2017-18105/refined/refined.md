The provided content is related to CVE-2017-18105.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The console login resource in Atlassian Crowd does not rotate the session ID during login.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session fixation vulnerability. An attacker can obtain a user's JSESSIONID cookie before they log in, and then use that same session ID after the user authenticates to gain access to some resources.

**Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can gain access to some of the built-in and potentially third-party REST resources.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to obtain a user's JSESSIONID cookie prior to the user logging in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to obtain the user's session cookie before login. The attacker must also be able to send requests using the captured session cookie.
