## FAQ

### Why is my email not sent?

Please make sure that the data specified on the plugin settings page is correct. In case you are using such mail services as Gmail, Yahoo, or other, you need to contact your mail service support team to get the correct settings.

### I’ve adjusted the settings the right way, and yet the email messages still fail to be sent

Please try sending a test email, having marked a “Display log” checkbox. You will then see a log, in which you can find the bug that triggers sending failures.

### On the plugin settings page, I see ‘Not Confirmed’ in the Settings Status block. Why?

To confirm that the settings are correct, you need to send a test email first. When the test email is sent successfully, please click “Settings are Correct” button.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

1. The link to the page where the problem occurs.
2. The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.
3. The version of your WordPress installation.
4. Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://bestwebsoft.com/documentation/admin-panel-issues/system-status/).

Had a problem with submissions from Jetpack Contact Form being rejected as spam at the receiving server, because of two things combined:
\* Sender not in my domain
\* Sending IP-adresse not trusted as legal sender for the server because of dedicated IP on shared hosting
\* gmail.com or other free email service as Reply-To
By sending to the local SMTP server using an default account, it worked again.
Excellent plugin to work with and set up.
