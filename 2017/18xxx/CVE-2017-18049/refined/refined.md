{
  "CVE-2017-18049": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "SilverStripe CMS is vulnerable to CSV Excel macro injection. The CSV export feature allows the output to contain macros and scripts that can be executed when imported into spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The CSV export functionality does not sanitize data, allowing the inclusion of macros and scripts within the exported CSV file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CSV Injection",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "When a user opens the exported CSV file in a spreadsheet application, the injected macros or scripts can be executed, leading to potential arbitrary code execution on the user's system.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker with normal user access can inject malicious content into user profile fields, which are later exported via the CSV export feature, affecting admin users.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a normal user to inject the payload in a profile field. The attacker also needs an administrator to export the CSV data. The attack is dependent on an administrator opening the exported CSV file on their local machine with spreadsheet software."
