The provided content is a description of the "Subscriber" plugin for WordPress. While it does mention a security fix, it does not provide details that are useful for a CVE analysis.

Specifically, the changelog entry for version 1.3.5 states "Bugfix : Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was fixed."  However, the content lacks crucial information required for a proper vulnerability analysis:

- **Root cause of the vulnerability:** The content only mentions "Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability", but not the root cause (e.g., failure to sanitize user input).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The type of XSS is not detailed (e.g., stored, reflected, DOM-based).
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of an XSS vulnerability (e.g., arbitrary script execution, session hijacking) is not detailed.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not mentioned (e.g., form field, URL parameter).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Details about the attacker's required capabilities or position are missing.

Because of the lack of specific vulnerability details, the appropriate response is:
