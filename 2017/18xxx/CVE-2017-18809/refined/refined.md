{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The advisory indicates a potential for medium impact due to the CVSS v3 score of 5.2. The CVSS vector string indicates low impact to confidentiality (C:L), integrity (I:L) and availability(A:L) with a scope change (S:C).",
  "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when a user interacts with the affected component. The vector string shows it is a local attack (AV:L)",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The CVSS vector (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L) indicates a local attack (AV:L), with low attack complexity (AC:L), and high privileges (PR:H) are needed. User interaction (UI:R) is required to trigger the vulnerability."
