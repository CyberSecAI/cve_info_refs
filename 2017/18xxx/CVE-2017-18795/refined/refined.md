The provided document discusses a command injection vulnerability found in NETGEAR D6220 and D6100 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document mentions a "command injection vulnerability" but does not elaborate on the specific cause.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** The document specifies a CVSS v3 score of 6.7 with High impact to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H). While not explicitly stated in text, command injection vulnerabilities generally allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector string indicates Local (AV:L) access and low complexity (AC:L), and that the attack does not require user interaction (UI:N). However it requires high privileges (PR:H).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device and high privileges.

This document provides more detail than the basic CVE description by including affected models, fixed firmware versions and the CVSS score. It also details how to update the device firmware to fix the vulnerability.
