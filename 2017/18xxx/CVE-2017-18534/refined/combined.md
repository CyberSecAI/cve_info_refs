## Description

This plugin adds a “Share on Diaspora” button at the bottom of your posts. Unlike other similar buttons,

this one is not tied to one single pod. Instead it allows the users to select their favorite pod from the list,

or type it directly. The button is highly customizable, allowing blog admins to set the color, size and shape in

accordance with the overall look and feel of their blogs.

#### i18n

There is an ongoing effort to translate the plugin into other languages.

So far, the following translations are available:

* French — contributed by Stef20 from stef20.info/blog and Se7h
* German — contributed by Georg Krause mail@georg-krause.net and JanRei
* Indonesian — cotribuited by https://www.chameleonjohn.com
* Italian — contributed by Sandro kensan kensan@kensan.it from www.kensan.it
* Japanese
* Portuguese (Brazil) — contributed by Vostok info@diaspbr.org
* Romanian
* Russian
* Serbo-Croatian — contributed by Borisa Djuraskovic from Webhostinghub.com
* Spanish — contributed by Andrew Kurtis from Webhostinghub.com and David Charte

Please note, that some translations might be incomplete and lack latest changes.

## FAQ

### Is it another button linked to JoinDiaspora?

No. Users can reshare to any Diaspora pod: select from the list or type their

own.

### I want to report a bug, request a feature or contribute code. What shall I do?

Bug reports, feature requests and real code are always welcome. Check out

https://github.com/ciubotaru/share-on-diaspora or drop a line to “vitalie at

ciubotaru dot tokyo”.

### Does your plugin collect private information about blog visitors?

No.

### The button color scheme does not fit into my blog theme. Can I change it?

Yes. In the plugin settings panel, go to ‘Color profiles’ tab and select a

preset profile that fits your blog theme. For fine-tuning, go to ‘Button

options’ tab (default) and tweak the colors, size and shape of your button.

Don’t forget to press ‘Update’ after you are done.

### I want to use my own image. Is it possible?

Yes. In the plugin settings panel, go to ‘Custom image’ tab and upload your

image or insert the URL of an existing image (e.g. from your Media gallery).

After you are done, press ‘Update’.

### I want to change the list of displayed pods. Is it possible?

Yes. You can do this on the ‘Pod list options’ tab in the settings panel. To

get (or update) the list of all active pods, press the ‘Retrieve’ button. To

add a pod from the list, select it with up/down keys in the ‘Add a pod’ textbox

and press ‘Add’. To add a custom pod, type it in the textbox and press ‘Add’.

After you’ve added all pods that you want to see in the dialog, press ‘Update’.

### Can I get the latest list of active pods?

Yes. You can manually retrieve a fresh list of active pods on the ‘Pod list

options’ tab of the settings panel. Press the ‘Retrive’ button to download the

list, then press ‘Update’ to save changes. Now the list of active pods is

available in the ‘Add a pod’ textbox. Use up/down keys to navigate the list.

Alternatively, you can install an auxiliary plugin called

[Diaspora Podlist Updater](https://wordpress.org/plugins/diaspora-podlist-updater/)

that automatically retrieves a fresh list of active pods.
