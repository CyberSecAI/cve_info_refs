The provided content is related to the WordPress plugin "Share on Diaspora," but it does not contain information about CVE-2017-18534. The changelog mentions a reflected XSS vulnerability that was fixed in version 0.7.2, which *could* be related to the specified CVE but this is not specified.

Specifically, the changelog includes:

*   **0.7.2:** "Bug-fix: a reflected XSS in share url parameters (patch provided by Framartin@GitHub)."

Given this limited information, here's a potential analysis, with the caveat that this is speculative without further confirmation:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization/validation of user-supplied data in URL parameters used for sharing posts on Diaspora.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the share URL. When a victim clicks on such a crafted link, the script would be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:**  An attacker could create a malicious link containing a payload within the share URL. Then, the attacker would need to trick the victim into clicking this link.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL and convince a user to visit it.

It is important to note that the provided text does not specify that the reflected XSS vulnerability is, in fact, CVE-2017-18534.
