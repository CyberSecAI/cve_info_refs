- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A hardcoded backdoor PIN "17621762" was found in the `CalculatorActivity.java` file. This allows access to sensitive data without the correct PIN entered by the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Hardcoded credentials, backdoor.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Bypassing the intended authentication mechanism, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data stored by the application, despite the user setting a different pin.
- **Attack vectors**: By entering the hardcoded PIN "17621762" in the application's calculator interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires physical or remote access to a device with the vulnerable application installed. No special privileges are required beyond using the app.
