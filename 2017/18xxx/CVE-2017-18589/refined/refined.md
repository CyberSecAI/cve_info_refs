Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `Duration::seconds` method in the `time` crate to parse the `Max-Age` cookie setting. This method would panic if the provided value was greater than 2^64/1000 and less than or equal to 2^64.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation: The code didn't check if the provided `Max-Age` value was within the acceptable range for the `Duration::seconds` method, leading to a potential panic.
- Denial of Service: The panic could crash the application processing the cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could trigger a server or client-side crash by sending a cookie with a specially crafted `Max-Age` value.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker sending a malicious cookie with an invalid `Max-Age` value in a network request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests containing a cookie with a malicious `Max-Age` value to a vulnerable application. No special privileges or user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check and clamping the `Max-Age` value to the maximum allowed duration.
- The vulnerable code is present in versions of the `cookie` crate before `0.6.0`, between `0.6.0` and `0.6.2` and before `0.7.6`. Patched versions are `0.6.2` and `0.7.6` or later.
- The vulnerability is identified as RUSTSEC-2017-0005, CVE-2017-18589 and GHSA-vjrq-cg9x-rfjp.
