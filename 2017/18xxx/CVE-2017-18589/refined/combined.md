Duration will panic if the number of seconds is greater than 2^63/1000. This just caps the Max-Age to the highest value we can parse.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Can we use `min` here instead? Something like:

```
let capped_val = cmp::min(Duration::max_value().num_seconds(), val);
Some(Duration::seconds(capped_val))
```

### Description

Affected versions of this crate use the `time` crate and the method
`Duration::seconds` to parse the `Max-Age` duration cookie setting. This method
will panic if the value is greater than 2^64/1000 and less than or equal to
2^64, which can result in denial of service for a client or server.

This flaw was corrected by explicitly checking for the `Max-Age` being in this
integer range and clamping the value to the maximum duration value.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
