Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `exempi` library handles the width and height parameters within the VP8X chunk of a WebP image file. Specifically, the `VP8XChunk::width()` and `VP8XChunk::height()` methods directly use the provided width/height, and write `val - 1` into a buffer using `PutLE24`, which is intended for a 24 bit value. If val is 0, the result will be -1, which due to unsigned integer casting is `0xffffff`, which fails an assertion `val < (1 << 24)` in `PutLE24`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Underflow/Invalid Value Handling:** The code doesn't properly handle the case where the width or height value (`val`) is 0. Subtracting 1 from 0 results in a large unsigned value which cause an assertion failure.
- **Assertion Failure:** A crafted WebP image with a width or height value of 0 can trigger an assertion failure, leading to a crash of the application using the `exempi` library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the application using the `exempi` library upon processing a maliciously crafted WebP file. This can cause a denial of service if the application is processing user-supplied or untrusted files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious WebP File:** An attacker can craft a WebP image with a zero-valued width or height parameter in the VP8X chunk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious WebP file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of the `exempi` library. This could be through a file upload, email attachment, or any other mechanism where the application will process the untrusted file.

**Additional details:**
The provided diff shows that the fix is to prevent passing 0 to the `PutLE24` function, by checking if `val > 0`. If not, it passes 0 instead, avoiding the underflow and assertion failure.
