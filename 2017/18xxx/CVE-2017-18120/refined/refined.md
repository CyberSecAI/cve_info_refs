Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-18120:

**Root Cause:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the `read_gif` function within the `gifread.c` file of gifsicle. This occurs due to mishandling of the `last_name` variable during the processing of GIF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Double-Free:** The vulnerability allows for a memory location to be freed twice which leads to memory corruption and can cause the application to crash.
- **Incorrect Memory Management:** The `last_name` variable is not properly reset leading to the double-free when certain GIF structures are processed. Specifically, when a name extension is followed by an image, `last_name` should be set to `NULL` unconditionally.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service by providing a crafted GIF file, which causes the application to crash.
- **Unspecified Impact:** The reports indicate that the vulnerability could have other unspecified impacts beyond DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted GIF File:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted GIF file that triggers the double-free condition. The attacker provides this file as input to the `gifsicle` or `gifdiff` command-line tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `gifsicle` or `gifdiff` tools. This could be achieved via a network connection (if the tool is exposed) or by getting the user to process a maliciously crafted file.
- No special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability manifests as a double free in the `read_gif` function related to how it manages memory allocations while parsing GIF files.
- The AddressSanitizer (ASan) reports from the provided data show the specific location of the double-free and use-after-free issues within the `gifsicle` and `gifdiff` tools, specifically `Gif_Realloc`, `suck_data`, and `read_gif` functions.
- The fix involves ensuring that `last_name` is set to NULL unconditionally.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was found by a fuzzer developed by the 'SoftSec' group at KAIST.
- The vulnerability was present in `gifsicle` version 1.90-1 and was fixed in version 1.91-2.
- The bug reports indicate that this is a separate issue than CVE-2017-1000421.
- The issue was tracked in Debian as bugs #878739 and #881120.
- The fix was addressed in commit `118a46090c50829dc543179019e6140e1235f909` in the upstream repository.
- The initial github issue report is located at `https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle/issues/117`.
