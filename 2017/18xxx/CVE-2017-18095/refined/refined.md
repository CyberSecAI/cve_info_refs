- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in the `SnippetRPCServiceImpl` class.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to missing authorization checks when commenting on code snippets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can comment on snippets they are not authorized to access.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely. Attackers can send requests to the `SnippetRPCServiceImpl` to comment on unauthorized snippets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send requests to the Crucible application.
