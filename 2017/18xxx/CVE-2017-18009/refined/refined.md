- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `cv::HdrDecoder::checkSignature` function within the `modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_hdr.cpp` file. This is due to an improper size check when comparing a signature with a known magic number using `memcmp`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The `memcmp` reads beyond the allocated buffer of the input string if the provided input has a small size and is compared with a bigger size during `checkSignature` function.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash, potentially leading to denial-of-service or other unforeseen consequences like arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves providing a crafted HDR image file that causes a buffer overflow when the file's signature is checked. This is triggered when reading an image using `cv::imread`. The vulnerability is reachable via the `cv::HdrDecoder::checkSignature` function which is called when the application attempts to decode an image file that is declared as an HDR image.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted file to the targeted application, and that application must call the vulnerable `cv::imread` function on the malicious file. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
