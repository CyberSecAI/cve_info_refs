{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an invalid memcpy operation that can lead to a use-after-free condition when processing a crafted PDF file containing JPEG data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Invalid memcpy operation",
       "Buffer Overrun",
       "Overlapping memory copy"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the use-after-free.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted PDF file containing JPEG data",
        "Malformed file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF file to an application that uses the vulnerable Exempi library for processing.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability resides in `XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/ReconcileTIFF.cpp`, `XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/TIFF_MemoryReader.cpp`, and `XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/TIFF_Support.hpp`. The issue was identified through a crash report triggered by a malformed PDF file. The fix involves checking for buffer overruns and using memmove instead of memcpy to handle overlapping memory regions.  There was also a use-after-free in exception handling that was fixed."
