The provided content relates to CVE-2017-18212.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `lit_read_code_unit_from_hex` function within the JerryScript engine. This function is responsible for reading code units from hexadecimal representations within regular expressions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, meaning that the code writes beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. Specifically, the `lit_read_code_unit_from_hex` function does not properly validate the input and may write out of bounds when processing a crafted hexadecimal sequence within a regular expression.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash (denial of service) or, potentially, arbitrary code execution. The heap-buffer-overflow can corrupt memory, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malicious regular expression. The specific payload that triggers the overflow is `RegExp("[\x0")`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted regular expression to be processed by the vulnerable JerryScript engine. This could be through a website or application that uses JerryScript to interpret Javascript code, including regular expressions. The attacker needs no special privileges.
