    "CVE-2017-18344": {
      "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read in the POSIX timers subsystem in the Linux kernel. The timer_create syscall implementation in kernel/time/posix-timers.c does not properly validate the sigevent->sigev_notify field.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],

      "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs in the show_timer function, which is called when `/proc/$PID/timers` is read. The vulnerability was fixed in kernel versions 4.14.8."
