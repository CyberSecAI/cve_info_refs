- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The init script for `jabberd2` gives ownership of its PID file directory to the `jabber` user. When the service is stopped, root sends a SIGTERM signal to the processes listed in the PID files within this directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is due to the fact that `jabberd2` creates the PID files, while `start-stop-daemon` is responsible for dropping privileges. This order of operations allows the `jabber` user to manipulate PID files, potentially leading to a privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The `jabber` user can manipulate PID files to kill root-owned processes by placing arbitrary PIDs in the PID files.
- **Attack vectors**:  The `jabber` user needs write access to the directory where the PID files are stored, which is achieved because the init script grants the `jabber` user ownership of the PID file directory `/var/run/jabber`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have the privileges of the `jabber` user to exploit this vulnerability.
