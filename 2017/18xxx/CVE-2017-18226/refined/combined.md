| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-09-15 12:39:58 UTC  ``` The init script for jabberd2 gives ownership of its PID file directory to the "jabber" user:    start_pre() {       checkpath -d -o jabber /var/run/jabber   }  This can be exploited by the "jabber" user to kill root processes, since when the service is stopped, root will send a SIGTERM to the contents of any PID files he finds.  The problem is ultimately due to the fact that jabberd is allowed to create the PID files, while start-stop-daemon is responsible for dropping privileges (which happens first). Instead, I recommend commenting out all of the <pidfile> directives in the jabberd XML config files, and passing "--make-pidfile" to start-stop-daemom in the init script. That will cause start-stop-daemon to create the PID files as root:root, and they can all be placed directly in /run to avoid the vulnerability.  (This init script is a mess because it's used to start more than one service. I would also strongly recommend that it be split up into three or four init scripts, one for each service -- all of them would then become considerably simpler.) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-03-03 17:19:15 UTC  ``` Package was removed via <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=b50a30689fca4c60d2b4e625f341daff116e51b6>.  New GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Christopher Díaz Riveros (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2018-03-12 11:05:15 UTC  ``` CVE-2017-18226 was assigned for this issue. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2018-03-19 01:07:05 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201803-07 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201803-07> by GLSA coordinator Christopher Diaz Riveros (chrisadr). ``` |  |
