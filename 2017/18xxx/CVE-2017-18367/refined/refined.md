{
  "CVE-2017-18367": {
    "Description": "The golang-seccomp library incorrectly generates BPFs, using OR logic instead of AND logic when specifying multiple syscall arguments, leading to a bypass of intended access restrictions.",
    "Root cause": "The golang-seccomp library was incorrectly applying OR logic to multiple syscall argument rules instead of AND logic, which is the expected behavior of the underlying libseccomp library.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect logic in BPF generation",
      "Bypass of intended seccomp restrictions"
    ],
    "Impact": "A process running under a restrictive seccomp filter that specified multiple syscall arguments could bypass the intended restrictions by specifying a single matching argument.",
    "Attack vector": "Exploitation occurs when a process uses golang-seccomp to create a seccomp filter with multiple syscall arguments.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to influence the arguments to syscalls used by an application using the vulnerable golang-seccomp library."
