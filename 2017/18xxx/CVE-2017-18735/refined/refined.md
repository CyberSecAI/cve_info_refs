This document provides information about a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router and extender models.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a pre-authentication command injection flaw. This means an attacker can execute commands on the affected device without needing to log in or authenticate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command injection vulnerability allowing arbitrary command execution.
- Occurs prior to authentication, meaning no login is required for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full compromise of the device through arbitrary command execution.
- Impact includes high Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- An attacker can potentially gain full control of the device, modify its configuration, or use it as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based, meaning an attacker on the same network or with access to the device's network interface can exploit it.
- It is pre-authentication, meaning an attacker does not require any valid credentials to be present on the network device.
- Specific attack vectors and payload details are not provided but it is implied that the vulnerability can be triggered via the network interfaces of the devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment or have network access to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or user credentials.

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**
The following products are affected by this vulnerability with firmware versions prior to the ones listed below:
* JR6150, prior to 1.0.1.10
* PR2000, prior to 1.0.0.18
* R6050, prior to 1.0.1.10
* R6700v2, prior to 1.2.0.4
* R6800, prior to 1.2.0.4
* R6900v2, prior to 1.2.0.4

**CVSS v3 Score:**
- 8.8 (High)
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  - AV:A (Adjacent): The attack requires access to the same network segment
  - AC:L (Low): The attack is easily executed
  - PR:N (None): No privileges are required
  - UI:N (None): No user interaction is required
  - S:U (Unchanged): An exploited vulnerability impacts only the vulnerable component
  - C:H (High): High impact on confidentiality
  - I:H (High): High impact on integrity
  - A:H (High): High impact on availability

This advisory provides more details than the basic CVE description, including affected products, firmware versions, and CVSS score and vector, and it clarifies that this is a pre-authentication vulnerability that can lead to remote command execution.
