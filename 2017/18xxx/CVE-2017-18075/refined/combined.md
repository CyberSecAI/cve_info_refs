After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

crypto: pcrypt - fix freeing pcrypt instances

```
pcrypt is using the old way of freeing instances, where the ->free()
method specified in the 'struct crypto_template' is passed a pointer to
the 'struct crypto_instance'.  But the crypto_instance is being
kfree()'d directly, which is incorrect because the memory was actually
allocated as an aead_instance, which contains the crypto_instance at a
nonzero offset.  Thus, the wrong pointer was being kfree()'d.

Fix it by switching to the new way to free aead_instance's where the
->free() method is specified in the aead_instance itself.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)

crypto: pcrypt - fix freeing pcrypt instancespcrypt is using the old way of freeing instances, where the ->free()
method specified in the 'struct crypto\_template' is passed a pointer to
the 'struct crypto\_instance'. But the crypto\_instance is being
kfree()'d directly, which is incorrect because the memory was actually
allocated as an aead\_instance, which contains the crypto\_instance at a
nonzero offset. Thus, the wrong pointer was being kfree()'d.
Fix it by switching to the new way to free aead\_instance's where the
->free() method is specified in the aead\_instance itself.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

mtd: nand: pxa3xx: Fix READOOB implementation
commit fee4380f368e84ed216b62ccd2fbc4126f2bf40b upstream.
In the current driver, OOB bytes are accessed in raw mode, and when a
page access is done with NDCR\_SPARE\_EN set and NDCR\_ECC\_EN cleared, the
driver must read the whole spare area (64 bytes in case of a 2k page,
16 bytes for a 512 page). The driver was only reading the free OOB
bytes, which was leaving some unread data in the FIFO and was somehow
leading to a timeout.
We could patch the driver to read ->spare\_size + ->ecc\_size instead of
just ->spare\_size when READOOB is requested, but we'd better make
in-band and OOB accesses consistent.
Since the driver is always accessing in-band data in non-raw mode (with
the ECC engine enabled), we should also access OOB data in this mode.
That's particularly useful when using the BCH engine because in this
mode the free OOB bytes are also ECC protected.

Like the power architecture we use the "or" assembler instructions,
which translate to nops on real hardware, to indicate that qemu shall

parisc: Fix alignment of pa\_tlb\_lock in assembly on 32-bit SMP kernel
commit 88776c0e70be0290f8357019d844aae15edaa967 upstream.
Qemu for PARISC reported on a 32bit SMP parisc kernel strange failures
about "Not-handled unaligned insn 0x0e8011d6 and 0x0c2011c9."
Those opcodes evaluate to the ldcw() assembly instruction which requires
(on 32bit) an alignment of 16 bytes to ensure atomicity.
As it turns out, qemu is correct and in our assembly code in entry.S and
pacache.S we don't pay attention to the required alignment.
This patch fixes the problem by aligning the lock offset in assembly
code in the same manner as we do in our C-code.

apparmor: fix regression in mount mediation when feature set is pinned
commit 5b9f57cf47b87f07210875d6a24776b4496b818d upstream.
When the mount code was refactored for Labels it was not correctly
updated to check whether policy supported mediation of the mount
class. This causes a regression when the kernel feature set is
reported as supporting mount and policy is pinned to a feature set
that does not support mount mediation.

powerpc/mm: Fix SEGV on mapped region to return SEGV\_ACCERR
commit ecb101aed86156ec7cd71e5dca668e09146e6994 upstream.
The recent refactoring of the powerpc page fault handler in commit
c3350602e876 ("powerpc/mm: Make bad\_area\* helper functions") caused
access to protected memory regions to indicate SEGV\_MAPERR instead of
the traditional SEGV\_ACCERR in the si\_code field of a user-space
signal handler. This can confuse debug libraries that temporarily
change the protection of memory regions, and expect to use SEGV\_ACCERR
as an indication to restore access to a region.
This commit restores the previous behavior. The following program
exhibits the issue:
$ ./repro read || echo "FAILED"
$ ./repro write || echo "FAILED"
$ ./repro exec || echo "FAILED"
#include
#include

ARC: uaccess: dont use "l" gcc inline asm constraint modifier
commit 79435ac78d160e4c245544d457850a56f805ac0d upstream.
This used to setup the LP\_COUNT register automatically, but now has been
removed.
There was an earlier fix 3c7c7a2fc8811 which fixed instance in delay.h but
somehow missed this one as gcc change had not made its way into
production toolchains and was not pedantic as it is now !

iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Cope with duplicated Stream IDs
commit 563b5cbe334e9503ab2b234e279d500fc4f76018 upstream.
For PCI devices behind an aliasing PCIe-to-PCI/X bridge, the bridge
alias to DevFn 0.0 on the subordinate bus may match the original RID of
the device, resulting in the same SID being present in the device's
fwspec twice. This causes trouble later in arm\_smmu\_write\_strtab\_ent()
when we wind up visiting the STE a second time and find it already live.
Avoid the issue by giving arm\_smmu\_install\_ste\_for\_dev() the cleverness
to skip over duplicates. It seems mildly counterintuitive compared to
preventing the duplicates from existing in the first place, but since
the DT and ACPI probe paths build their fwspecs differently, this is
actually the cleanest and most self-contained way to deal with it.

kernel/signal.c: remove the no longer needed SIGNAL\_UNKILLABLE check in complete\_signal()
commit 426915796ccaf9c2bd9bb06dc5702225957bc2e5 upstream.
complete\_signal() checks SIGNAL\_UNKILLABLE before it starts to destroy
the thread group, today this is wrong in many ways.
If nothing else, fatal\_signal\_pending() should always imply that the
whole thread group (except ->group\_exit\_task if it is not NULL) is
killed, this check breaks the rule.
After the previous changes we can rely on sig\_task\_ignored();
sig\_fatal(sig) && SIGNAL\_UNKILLABLE can only be true if we actually want
to kill this task and sig == SIGKILL OR it is traced and debugger can
intercept the signal.
This should hopefully fix the problem reported by Dmitry. This
test-case
static int init(void \*arg)
{
for (;;)
pause();
}
int main(void)
{
char stack[16 \* 1024];
for (;;) {
int pid = clone(init, stack + sizeof(stack)/2,
CLONE\_NEWPID | SIGCHLD, NULL);
assert(pid > 0);
assert(ptrace(PTRACE\_ATTACH, pid, 0, 0) == 0);
assert(waitpid(-1, NULL, WSTOPPED) == pid);
assert(ptrace(PTRACE\_DETACH, pid, 0, SIGSTOP) == 0);
assert(syscall(\_\_NR\_tkill, pid, SIGKILL) == 0);
assert(pid == wait(NULL));
}
}
triggers the WARN\_ON\_ONCE(!(task->jobctl & JOBCTL\_STOP\_PENDING)) in
task\_participate\_group\_stop(). do\_signal\_stop()->signal\_group\_exit()
checks SIGNAL\_GROUP\_EXIT and return false, but task\_set\_jobctl\_pending()
checks fatal\_signal\_pending() and does not set JOBCTL\_STOP\_PENDING.
And his should fix the minor security problem reported by Kyle,
SECCOMP\_RET\_TRACE can miss fatal\_signal\_pending() the same way if the
task is the root of a pid namespace.

kernel/signal.c: protect the traced SIGNAL\_UNKILLABLE tasks from SIGKILL
commit 628c1bcba204052d19b686b5bac149a644cdb72e upstream.
The comment in sig\_ignored() says "Tracers may want to know about even
ignored signals" but SIGKILL can not be reported to debugger and it is
just wrong to return 0 in this case: SIGKILL should only kill the
SIGNAL\_UNKILLABLE task if it comes from the parent ns.
Change sig\_ignored() to ignore ->ptrace if sig == SIGKILL and rely on
sig\_task\_ignored().
SISGTOP coming from within the namespace is not really right too but at
least debugger can intercept it, and we can't drop it here because this
will break "gdb -p 1": ptrace\_attach() won't work. Perhaps we will add
another ->ptrace check later, we will see.

x86 / CPU: Always show current CPU frequency in /proc/cpuinfo
commit 7d5905dc14a87805a59f3c5bf70173aac2bb18f8 upstream.
After commit 890da9cf0983 (Revert "x86: do not use cpufreq\_quick\_get()
for /proc/cpuinfo "cpu MHz"") the "cpu MHz" number in /proc/cpuinfo
on x86 can be either the nominal CPU frequency (which is constant)
or the frequency most recently requested by a scaling governor in
cpufreq, depending on the cpufreq configuration. That is somewhat
inconsistent and is different from what it was before 4.13, so in
order to restore the previous behavior, make it report the current
CPU frequency like the scaling\_cur\_freq sysfs file in cpufreq.
To that end, modify the /proc/cpuinfo implementation on x86 to use
aperfmperf\_snapshot\_khz() to snapshot the APERF and MPERF feedback
registers, if available, and use their values to compute the CPU
frequency to be reported as "cpu MHz".
However, do that carefully enough to avoid accumulating delays that
lead to unacceptable access times for /proc/cpuinfo on systems with
many CPUs. Run aperfmperf\_snapshot\_khz() once on all CPUs
asynchronously at the /proc/cpuinfo open time, add a single delay
upfront (if necessary) at that point and simply compute the current
frequency while running show\_cpuinfo() for each individual CPU.
Also, to avoid slowing down /proc/cpuinfo accesses too much, reduce
the default delay between consecutive APERF and MPERF reads to 10 ms,
which should be sufficient to get large enough numbers for the
frequency computation in all cases.

x86 / CPU: Avoid unnecessary IPIs in arch\_freq\_get\_on\_cpu()
commit b29c6ef7bb1257853c1e31616d84f55e561cf631 upstream.
Even though aperfmperf\_snapshot\_khz() caches the samples.khz value to
return if called again in a sufficiently short time, its caller,
arch\_freq\_get\_on\_cpu(), still uses smp\_call\_function\_single() to run it
which may allow user space to trigger an IPI storm by reading from the
scaling\_cur\_freq cpufreq sysfs file in a tight loop.
To avoid that, move the decision on whether or not to return the cached
samples.khz value to arch\_freq\_get\_on\_cpu().
This change was part of commit 941f5f0f6ef5 ("x86: CPU: Fix up "cpu MHz"
in /proc/cpuinfo"), but it was not the reason for the revert and it
remains applicable.

fscache: Fix the default for fscache\_maybe\_release\_page()
commit 98801506552593c9b8ac11021b0cdad12cab4f6b upstream.
Fix the default for fscache\_maybe\_release\_page() for when the cookie isn't
valid or the page isn't cached. It mustn't return false as that indicates
the page cannot yet be freed.
The problem with the default is that if, say, there's no cache, but a
network filesystem's pages are using up almost all the available memory, a
system can OOM because the filesystem ->releasepage() op will not allow
them to be released as fscache\_maybe\_release\_page() incorrectly prevents
it.
This can be tested by writing a sequence of 512MiB files to an AFS mount.
It does not affect NFS or CIFS because both of those wrap the call in a
check of PG\_fscache and it shouldn't bother Ceph as that only has
PG\_private set whilst writeback is in progress. This might be an issue for
9P, however.
Note that the pages aren't entirely stuck. Removing a file or unmounting
will clear things because that uses ->invalidatepage() instead.

drm/i915: Apply Display WA #1183 on skl, kbl, and cfl
commit 30414f3010aff95ffdb6bed7b9dce62cde94fdc7 upstream.
Display WA #1183 was recently added to workaround
"Failures when enabling DPLL0 with eDP link rate 2.16
or 4.32 GHz and CD clock frequency 308.57 or 617.14 MHz
(CDCLK\_CTL CD Frequency Select 10b or 11b) used in this
enabling or in previous enabling."
This workaround was designed to minimize the impact only
to save the bad case with that link rates. But HW engineers
indicated that it should be safe to apply broadly, although
they were expecting the DPLL0 link rate to be unchanged on
runtime.
We need to cover 2 cases: when we are in fact enabling DPLL0
and when we are just changing the frequency with small
differences.
This is based on previous patch by Rodrigo Vivi with suggestions
from Ville Syrjälä.

crypto: pcrypt - fix freeing pcrypt instances
commit d76c68109f37cb85b243a1cf0f40313afd2bae68 upstream.
pcrypt is using the old way of freeing instances, where the ->free()
method specified in the 'struct crypto\_template' is passed a pointer to
the 'struct crypto\_instance'. But the crypto\_instance is being
kfree()'d directly, which is incorrect because the memory was actually
allocated as an aead\_instance, which contains the crypto\_instance at a
nonzero offset. Thus, the wrong pointer was being kfree()'d.
Fix it by switching to the new way to free aead\_instance's where the
->free() method is specified in the aead\_instance itself.

crypto: chacha20poly1305 - validate the digest size
commit e57121d08c38dabec15cf3e1e2ad46721af30cae upstream.
If the rfc7539 template was instantiated with a hash algorithm with
digest size larger than 16 bytes (POLY1305\_DIGEST\_SIZE), then the digest
overran the 'tag' buffer in 'struct chachapoly\_req\_ctx', corrupting the
subsequent memory, including 'cryptlen'. This caused a crash during
crypto\_skcipher\_decrypt().
Fix it by, when instantiating the template, requiring that the
underlying hash algorithm has the digest size expected for Poly1305.

crypto: n2 - cure use after free
commit 203f45003a3d03eea8fa28d74cfc74c354416fdb upstream.
queue\_cache\_init is first called for the Control Word Queue
(n2\_crypto\_probe). At that time, queue\_cache[0] is NULL and a new
kmem\_cache will be allocated. If the subsequent n2\_register\_algs call
fails, the kmem\_cache will be released in queue\_cache\_destroy, but
queue\_cache\_init[0] is not set back to NULL.
So when the Module Arithmetic Unit gets probed next (n2\_mau\_probe),
queue\_cache\_init will not allocate a kmem\_cache again, but leave it
as its bogus value, causing a BUG() to trigger when queue\_cache[0] is
eventually passed to kmem\_cache\_zalloc:

efi/capsule-loader: Reinstate virtual capsule mapping
commit f24c4d478013d82bd1b943df566fff3561d52864 upstream.
Commit:
82c3768b8d68 ("efi/capsule-loader: Use a cached copy of the capsule header")
... refactored the capsule loading code that maps the capsule header,
to avoid having to map it several times.
However, as it turns out, the vmap() call we ended up removing did not
just map the header, but the entire capsule image, and dropping this
virtual mapping breaks capsules that are processed by the firmware
immediately (i.e., without a reboot).
Unfortunately, that change was part of a larger refactor that allowed
a quirk to be implemented for Quark, which has a non-standard memory
layout for capsules, and we have slightly painted ourselves into a
corner by allowing quirk code to mangle the capsule header and memory
layout.
So we need to fix this without breaking Quark. Fortunately, Quark does
not appear to care about the virtual mapping, and so we can simply
do a partial revert of commit:
2a457fb31df6 ("efi/capsule-loader: Use page addresses rather than struct page pointers")
... and create a vmap() mapping of the entire capsule (including header)
based on the reinstated struct page array, unless running on Quark, in
which case we pass the capsule header copy as before.

btrfs: fix refcount\_t usage when deleting btrfs\_delayed\_nodes
commit ec35e48b286959991cdbb886f1bdeda4575c80b4 upstream.
refcounts have a generic implementation and an asm optimized one. The
generic version has extra debugging to make sure that once a refcount
goes to zero, refcount\_inc won't increase it.
The btrfs delayed inode code wasn't expecting this, and we're tripping
over the warnings when the generic refcounts are used. We ended up with
this race:
Process A Process B
btrfs\_get\_delayed\_node()
spin\_lock(root->inode\_lock)
radix\_tree\_lookup()
\_\_btrfs\_release\_delayed\_node()
refcount\_dec\_and\_test(&delayed\_node->refs)
our refcount is now zero
refcount\_add(2) <---
warning here, refcount
unchanged
spin\_lock(root->inode\_lock)
radix\_tree\_delete()
With the generic refcounts, we actually warn again when process B above
tries to release his refcount because refcount\_add() turned into a
no-op.
We saw this in production on older kernels without the asm optimized
refcounts.
The fix used here is to use refcount\_inc\_not\_zero() to detect when the
object is in the middle of being freed and return NULL. This is almost
always the right answer anyway, since we usually end up pitching the
delayed\_node if it didn't have fresh data in it.
This also changes \_\_btrfs\_release\_delayed\_node() to remove the extra
check for zero refcounts before radix tree deletion.
btrfs\_get\_delayed\_node() was the only path that was allowing refcounts
to go from zero to one.

userfaultfd: clear the vma->vm\_userfaultfd\_ctx if UFFD\_EVENT\_FORK fails
commit 0cbb4b4f4c44f54af268969b18d8deda63aded59 upstream.
The previous fix in commit 384632e67e08 ("userfaultfd: non-cooperative:
fix fork use after free") corrected the refcounting in case of
UFFD\_EVENT\_FORK failure for the fork userfault paths.
That still didn't clear the vma->vm\_userfaultfd\_ctx of the vmas that
were set to point to the aborted new uffd ctx earlier in
dup\_userfaultfd.

mm/sparse.c: wrong allocation for mem\_section
commit d09cfbbfa0f761a97687828b5afb27b56cbf2e19 upstream.
In commit 83e3c48729d9 ("mm/sparsemem: Allocate mem\_section at runtime
for CONFIG\_SPARSEMEM\_EXTREME=y") mem\_section is allocated at runtime to
save memory.
It allocates the first dimension of array with sizeof(struct mem\_section).
It costs extra memory, should be sizeof(struct mem\_section \*).
Fix it.

kernel/acct.c: fix the acct->needcheck check in check\_free\_space()
commit 4d9570158b6260f449e317a5f9ed030c2504a615 upstream.
As Tsukada explains, the time\_is\_before\_jiffies(acct->needcheck) check
is very wrong, we need time\_is\_after\_jiffies() to make sys\_acct() work.
Ignoring the overflows, the code should "goto out" if needcheck >
jiffies, while currently it checks "needcheck < jiffies" and thus in the
likely case check\_free\_space() does nothing until jiffies overflow.
In particular this means that sys\_acct() is simply broken, acct\_on()
sets acct->needcheck = jiffies and expects that check\_free\_space()
should set acct->active = 1 after the free-space check, but this won't
happen if jiffies increments in between.
This was broken by commit 32dc73086015 ("get rid of timer in
kern/acct.c") in 2011, then another (correct) commit 795a2f22a8ea
("acct() should honour the limits from the very beginning") made the
problem more visible.

x86/tlb: Drop the \_GPL from the cpu\_tlbstate export
commit 1e5476815fd7f98b888e01a0f9522b63085f96c9 upstream.
The recent changes for PTI touch cpu\_tlbstate from various tlb\_flush
inlines. cpu\_tlbstate is exported as GPL symbol, so this causes a
regression when building out of tree drivers for certain graphics cards.
Aside of that the export was wrong since it was introduced as it should
have been EXPORT\_PER\_CPU\_SYMBOL\_GPL().
Use the correct PER\_CPU export and drop the \_GPL to restore the previous
state which allows users to utilize the cards they payed for.
As always I'm really thrilled to make this kind of change to support the
#friends (or however the hot hashtag of today is spelled) from that closet
sauce graphics corp.

set\_pte\_vaddr is used to map the ds buffers into the cpu entry area, but
there are two problems with that:
1) The resulting flush is not supposed to be called in preemptible context
2) The cpu entry area is supposed to be per CPU, but the debug store
buffers are mapped for all CPUs so these mappings need to be flushed
globally.
Add the necessary preemption protection across the mapping code and flush
TLBs globally.

x86/kaslr: Fix the vaddr\_end mess
commit 1dddd25125112ba49706518ac9077a1026a18f37 upstream.
vaddr\_end for KASLR is only documented in the KASLR code itself and is
adjusted depending on config options. So it's not surprising that a change
of the memory layout causes KASLR to have the wrong vaddr\_end. This can map
arbitrary stuff into other areas causing hard to understand problems.
Remove the whole ifdef magic and define the start of the cpu\_entry\_area to
be the end of the KASLR vaddr range.
Add documentation to that effect.

x86/mm: Set MODULES\_END to 0xffffffffff000000
commit f5a40711fa58f1c109165a4fec6078bf2dfd2bdc upstream.
Since f06bdd4001c2 ("x86/mm: Adapt MODULES\_END based on fixmap section size")
kasan\_mem\_to\_shadow(MODULES\_END) could be not aligned to a page boundary.
So passing page unaligned address to kasan\_populate\_zero\_shadow() have two
possible effects:
1) It may leave one page hole in supposed to be populated area. After commit
21506525fb8d ("x86/kasan/64: Teach KASAN about the cpu\_entry\_area") that
hole happens to be in the shadow covering fixmap area and leads to crash:
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at fffffbffffe8ee04

Note, the crash likely disappeared after commit 92a0f81d8957, which
changed kasan\_populate\_zero\_shadow() call the way it was before
commit 21506525fb8d.
2) Attempt to load module near MODULES\_END will fail, because
\_\_vmalloc\_node\_range() called from kasan\_module\_alloc() will hit the
WARN\_ON(!pte\_none(\*pte)) in the vmap\_pte\_range() and bail out with error.
To fix this we need to make kasan\_mem\_to\_shadow(MODULES\_END) page aligned
which means that MODULES\_END should be 8\*PAGE\_SIZE aligned.
The whole point of commit f06bdd4001c2 was to move MODULES\_END down if
NR\_CPUS is big, so the cpu\_entry\_area takes a lot of space.
But since 92a0f81d8957 ("x86/cpu\_entry\_area: Move it out of the fixmap")
the cpu\_entry\_area is no longer in fixmap, so we could just set
MODULES\_END to a fixed 8\*PAGE\_SIZE aligned address.
