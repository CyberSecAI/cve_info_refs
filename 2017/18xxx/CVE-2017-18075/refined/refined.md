Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18075:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `pcrypt` module within the Linux kernel's crypto subsystem.
- The `pcrypt` module used an outdated method for freeing instances. It was freeing memory using a pointer from `struct crypto_instance`, but the actual memory was allocated as `aead_instance`, which contains `crypto_instance` at an offset. This resulted in `kfree()` being called with an incorrect pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect memory management:** The primary weakness is the use of an incorrect pointer for freeing memory allocated for `aead_instance`.
- **Use-after-free potential:** While not explicitly stated as a use-after-free in the provided texts, incorrect freeing could lead to use-after-free scenarios if the freed memory is accessed afterward.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a system crash due to `kfree()` being called with an incorrect address.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not definitively confirmed, the provided text from Red Hat states that privilege escalation can't be fully ruled out due to the nature of the flaw.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local attacker:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **AF_ALG and pcrypt access:** The attacker must be able to access the AF_ALG-based AEAD interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_AEAD) and the pcrypt functionality (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_PCRYPT).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- They must also be able to use the system calls required to access the vulnerable `pcrypt` module.

**Additional details:**
- The provided patch from the kernel git repository ([https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d76c68109f37cb85b243a1cf0f40313afd2bae68](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d76c68109f37cb85b243a1cf0f40313afd2bae68))  switches to the correct method for freeing `aead_instance`s by specifying the `->free()` method within the `aead_instance` struct itself.
- Red Hat states that their Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are not vulnerable as the vulnerable code is not enabled in those products. However, RHEL 7 for ARM64 and Power 9 LE are vulnerable.
- Ubuntu USN-3619-1 and USN-3619-2 contain fixes for this vulnerability.
