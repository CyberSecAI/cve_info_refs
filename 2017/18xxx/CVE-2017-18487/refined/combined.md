### [Impossible to Uninstall – Too much self-advertisement](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/impossible-to-uninstall-too-much-self-advertisement/)

A good plugin is transparent. It does it’s job so well you don’t notice it until you need to. This one is anything but that.
This plugin’s dashboard has labels that compete with WP’s existing dashboard labels. This is bad UI implementation.
The link to deactivate the plugin doesn’t work. I ended up having to use SSH and WP-CLI to deactivate the plugin properly. I then promptly deleted it.
There is too much self-advertising for Best-Of-Web. I don’t mind a small link at the bottom of an admin page, but having several dashboard segments dedicated just to selling your stuff on my site in my admin space is going too far. It’s history.
It doesn’t work with Google Auto Ads.

Maybe this plugin is not bad, just needs update.
Currently destroying admin page. And ads not displayed (work with manual copy/paste code).

It’s great not having to mess around with the page code, this plugin fills the gap nicely!
