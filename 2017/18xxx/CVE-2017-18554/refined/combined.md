Analytics Tracker utilizes the latest and greatest features of Google global site tag (gtag.js) and makes it super easy to add tracking code on your blog.

* **User ID** – This is intended to be a known identifier for a user provided by the site owner/tracking library user.
* **Anonymize IP** – The IP address of the sender will be anonymized
* **Display Features** – The plugin works by sending an additional request to stats.g.doubleclick.net that is used to provide advertising features like remarketing and demographics and interest reporting in Google Analytics.
* **Enhanced Link Attribution** – Enhanced Link Attribution improves the accuracy of your In-Page Analytics report by automatically differentiating between multiple links to the same URL on a single page by using link element IDs.
* **Custom Dimensions** – You can use custom dimensions to track: Tags, Category, Archive, Author, Post Format, Post Type
* **Event** – for Download, Email, Phone number, Outbound links, Error 404, Search, Add a comment, Scroll Depth

How can I suggest a new feature, contribute or report a bug?

You can submit pull requests, feature requests and bug reports on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/valeriu/analytics-tracker).

What are the requirements to use this plugin?

You need an active Google Analytics account and obviously a WordPress blog.

Where can I see the analytics report?

You can see your detailed analytics report in your [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) account.

What data does the tracking snippet capture?

When you add either of these tracking snippets to your website, you send a pageview for each page your users visit. Google Analytics processes this data and can infer a great deal of information including:

* The total time a user spends on your site.
* The time a user spends on each page and in what order those pages were visited.
* What internal links were clicked (based on the URL of the next pageview).

In addition, the IP address, user agent string, and initial page inspection analytics.js does when creating a new tracker is used to determine things like the following:

* The geographic location of the user.
* What browser and operating system are being used.
* Screen size and whether Flash or Java is installed.
* The referring site.
