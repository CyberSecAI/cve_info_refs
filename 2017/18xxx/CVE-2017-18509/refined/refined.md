It also has the potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the `req` pointer and bypass kernel exploit mitigations, although practical exploitation is considered limited.\n\nAttack vectors: Exploitation occurs via crafted socket options, specifically `setsockopt` with IPPROTO_IPV6 and option `0xd1`.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be root, inside a default LXC container, or have CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges, or be a low-privileged user able to unshare user and network namespaces. The provided proof of concept (POC) shows how to trigger the crash."

However, based on the nature of the vulnerability, one could infer that it would likely require some level of system privileges."

If the attacker can control the pointer to some extent it could be further exploitable.\n\nAttack vectors: The attacker can trigger the crash using a program that creates a socket, puts it in listen mode, sets the malicious socket option, and then closes the socket. The code provided in the content triggers the vulnerability.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to execute code, and no specific permissions are mentioned although based on other content related to CVE-2017-18509 it's likely root, CAP_NET_ADMIN or able to unshare namespaces are necessary to trigger this issue."
