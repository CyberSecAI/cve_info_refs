  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the WLAN driver that allows an attacker to perform an out-of-bounds write or read, leading to the possibility of arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
       "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege allowing a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the device (likely through a malicious application) and exploit the WLAN driver through the vulnerable code path."
