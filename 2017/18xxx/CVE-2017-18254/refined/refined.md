{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The code allocates memory for global_colormap and colormap. If one allocation fails (returns NULL) but the other succeeds, a memory leak occurs in the if statement because the allocated memory is not freed before the function exits.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak",
	  "Improper error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak that could lead to resource exhaustion if the allocation failure occurs repeatedly.",
    "attack_vectors": "Triggering a condition that causes AcquireQuantumMemory to return NULL for one of the two allocations.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to provide input that leads to the specific code path in WriteGIFImage that triggers memory allocation with AcquireQuantumMemory"
