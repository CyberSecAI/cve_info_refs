## FAQ

### I can’t view, download or clear the log file.

Probably there is a problem with access to files and folders. For more information, please go to [Changing File Permissions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions).

### What is the difference between three methods of a log file creating, which are offered by the plugin?

All methods are equivalent, so when you turn on them all only one of them will work.

There may be unwanted conflicts.

1) Error logging via ‘.htaccess’ using ‘ini\_set’

This method is suitable if you have an access to the file “.htaccess” to edit it.

Also, this method allows you to create a log file, its name, change the absolute path to it.

‘php\_flag’ and ‘php\_value’ change the value of Apache directives by changing the server configuration. The plugin uses this method only to enable PHP errors logging and specifying the path to the log files. Other configuration settings you can change by yourself.

For more information, please visit [How to change configuration settings](http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php) and [Directives list php.ini](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php).

2) Error logging via ‘wp-config.php’ using ‘ini\_set’

If you don’t have an access to “.htaccess”, you can use file “wp-config.php” to change server configuration settings using the ‘ini\_set’ option and specifying a variety of error logging settings and other options. The plugin uses this method only to activate the PHP error logging and specifying the path to the log files.

For more information, please visit [Runtime Configuration](http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-log) and [ini\_set](http://php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php).

3) Error logging via ‘wp-config.php’ using ‘WP\_DEBUG’

This method is used for debugging errors using the WordPress PHP constants and declaring them in the “wp-config.php” file. This is a standard WordPress debugging method. This is a very good method which is recommended for using on WordPress sites, but errors are recorded in the file “debug.log” to the ‘wp-content’ directory. You can’t change the absolute path to file logs. This method is considered to be a priority on the WordPress sites. After declaring of these constants other methods won’t work.

For more information, please visit [Errors Debugging on the WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress).

### Why I can’t select all three methods to enable debug?

Because all methods are equivalent, so when you turn on them all only one of them will work.

There may be unwanted conflicts.

### I clicked on the checkbox to receive notification about the logs to my mailbox, however, the letters come less than it exposed in the settings. Why?

The function of notification sending implemented using WordPress hook ‘wp\_shedule\_event’. If during the chosen period of time the site has been inactive (no sign on it), this hook won’t work.

### After creating a log file there are identical files appear in tabs PHP Error Log Viewer and WP Error Log Viewer. Why?

It depends on the configuration of your server. In the tab of the log viewing the file will be only one.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

* The link to the page where the problem occurs
* The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.
* The version of your WordPress installation
* Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://bestwebsoft.com/documentation/admin-panel-issues/system-status/)
