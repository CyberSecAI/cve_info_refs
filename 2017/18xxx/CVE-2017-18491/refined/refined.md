**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were present. XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive user data
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector would involve injecting malicious JavaScript code through some input field or parameter processed by the plugin and displayed on the page. Without specific details of the vulnerability, the exact attack vector cannot be determined, but it's likely through one of the form fields or plugin settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code. This might involve:
    - Exploiting a vulnerability in the form's input validation or sanitization processes
    - Exploiting a flaw in how the plugin renders user-supplied input
    - Potentially, an attacker could exploit this using administrative access if the vulnerability was in the plugin settings

**Additional Notes:**
- It is important to note that the provided information does not provide details of the exact location or method of exploitation and only mentions that the vulnerability exists. The information is based on the changelog entry which states that a fix for "Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was fixed."

- It is crucial to verify if CVE-2017-18491 is the same XSS vulnerability mentioned in this changelog entry based on external sources. Since the CVE description is a placeholder, this verification cannot be done at this time.

- The changelog entries also point to several bugfixes and updates for the plugin. Some of them are related to other plugins like reCaptcha, Contact Form Multi, and Limit Attempts.

- It's also relevant that the plugin supports multiple languages, which often requires sanitization of user-provided translations to prevent XSS. The plugin is also actively maintained.
