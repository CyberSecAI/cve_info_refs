Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue within the logging feature of Atlassian FishEye. Specifically, the HTTP password for a repository is being logged, which should not occur.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information (repository HTTP password) in the logs.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker can potentially gain access to the repository if they obtain the leaked HTTP password from the logs. This can lead to the attacker reading or modifying the repository's contents.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Log Access:** Attackers would need to gain access to the logs where the HTTP password is being written. This could be achieved by various means such as compromised server, or unauthorized access to logging infrastructure.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote but needs the ability to access the application logs.
    * **Log Access:** Access to the location or system where the Fisheye logs are stored.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of Atlassian FishEye prior to 4.8.3.
*   The issue is labeled with `information-disclosure`, `information-leak`, and `security`.
*   The severity is rated as "Minor" which may be inaccurate considering the exposure of credentials.
