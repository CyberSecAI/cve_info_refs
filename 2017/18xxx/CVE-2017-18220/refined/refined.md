Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18220:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in the `ReadOneJNGImage` and `ReadJNGImage` functions within the `coders/png.c` file of GraphicsMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free: The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.
- Potential for other unspecified impacts: The use-after-free could lead to other, potentially more severe, issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted image file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted JNG (JPEG Network Graphics) image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious JNG image file to be processed by GraphicsMagick. This can be done through various means, such as:
    - Uploading the image to a website or application that uses GraphicsMagick for image processing.
    - Sending the image to a user who might open it using GraphicsMagick or an application that relies on it.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system; they only need to have a way to get the vulnerable software to process the malicious image file.
