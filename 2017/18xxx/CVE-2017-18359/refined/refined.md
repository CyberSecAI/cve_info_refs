Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `ST_AsX3D` function in PostGIS not properly handling empty geometry values. Specifically, when processing empty geometries, the function would return a zero-length string, random junk data, or even crash the client, instead of producing the expected output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The `ST_AsX3D` function lacked proper checks for empty geometry inputs, leading to unexpected behavior.
- Memory corruption or other undefined behavior:  The lack of proper handling of empty geometries resulted in either returning random data or causing a server crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS):  By providing crafted input, an attacker could trigger a crash of the PostGIS server or the client, leading to service disruption.
- Unspecified Behavior: The vulnerability could potentially result in other unspecified and unpredictable behavior, potentially leading to further security issues.
- Data Corruption: Although not explicitly mentioned, the possibility of unexpected data being returned may lead to data inconsistencies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious SQL Queries: An attacker could craft SQL queries that use the `ST_AsX3D` function with empty geometry inputs to trigger the vulnerability.
- Data Manipulation: If an attacker has control over the geometry data being processed by the function, they could insert empty geometry values to cause the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- SQL Access: The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries on a database with PostGIS installed.
- Knowledge of PostGIS: The attacker needs to know how to use the ST_AsX3D function.
- Ability to insert specific data: In some scenarios, the attacker needs the ability to insert specific data into the database.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes details about patches for both PostGIS 2.3.3 and 2.4, indicating that this vulnerability affected multiple versions of the software.
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a critical bug due to the potential for crashing the client and server.
- The fix implemented checks for empty geometries and returns an empty string as output instead of crashing or returning random values.

In summary, the vulnerability is caused by the `ST_AsX3D` function's inability to handle empty geometry inputs, leading to a denial-of-service condition, and potentially other undefined behaviors and impacts.
