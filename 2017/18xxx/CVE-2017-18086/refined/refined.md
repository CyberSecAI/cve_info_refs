- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of the `issuesURL` parameter within various resources of Atlassian Confluence Server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow a remote attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to actions like session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized access to user data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `issuesURL` parameter. The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter containing their malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by crafting a malicious `issuesURL` parameter. No specific user privileges within the application are needed to carry out the attack.
