- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Shibboleth login functionality in Blackboard Learn does not properly validate the `returnUrl` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL after a successful login.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unvalidated redirect.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website after they log in, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted URL with a malicious `returnUrl` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint, be able to create a malicious URL, and have a valid Blackboard Learn web server with Shibboleth set up. The user must be logged into the Blackboard system for the redirect to occur.
