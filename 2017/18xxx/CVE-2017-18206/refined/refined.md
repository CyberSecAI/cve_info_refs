  "description": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the zsh shell symbolic link resolver. A local, unprivileged user can create a specially crafted directory path which leads to a buffer overflow in the context of the user trying to do a symbolic link resolution in the aforementioned path. If the user affected is privileged, this leads to privilege escalation.",
