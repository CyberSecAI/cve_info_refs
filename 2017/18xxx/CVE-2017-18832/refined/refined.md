This document describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear fully managed switches.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A stored XSS vulnerability exists in the web interface of the listed Netgear switch models.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the switch's web interface, which would then be executed in the browsers of users accessing the interface. This could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected switches. A malicious script is stored by the attacker and triggered when a victim visits a page with the stored script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would likely need to have an authenticated session to the web interface, with high privileges, to inject and store the malicious script. The CVSS vector indicates that user interaction is required (UI:R) to trigger the exploit, meaning the attacker would need a user to access the affected page in the web interface, which would then trigger the stored XSS.
