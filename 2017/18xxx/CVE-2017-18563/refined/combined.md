## FAQ

### What is the difference between the free and pro versions?

The free version includes basic RSVP features for a single event, while the Pro version offers advanced functionalities such as multiple event management, attendance recording, and a better interaction with attendees through notifications and reminders.

### How can I upgrade to the Pro version?

You can upgrade to the Pro version by [purchasing a license](https://rsvpproplugin.com/pricing/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=description&utm_term=purchase+license) from our website, then folowing the [instructions provided in this article](https://rsvpproplugin.com/knowledge-base/migrating-from-free-to-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=description&utm_term=upgrade+to+pro).

### How do I allow users to RSVP?

This can be easily done by adding the [rsvp] shortcode to one of your pages.

### Can users register to the event themselves?

Yes, with the help of the [Open Registrations option](https://rsvpproplugin.com/knowledge-base/using-open-registrations/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=description&utm_term=open+registration).

### Can I Prefill Attendee Information?

Yes, go to the page associated with the RSVP form and add to the query string the following parameters.

* firstName – For the person’s first name
* lastName – For the person’s last name
* passcode – If passcode is enabled and/or required this will need to be added as well

For example if you have a page that is /rsvp for domain example.com your URL might look like – http://www.example.com/rsvp?firstName=test&lastName=test

Really great option for a wedding RSVP. Especially if you need custom questions for specific guests, or for groups, e.g. one guest to RSVP for everyone in their family. There’s also an option to import all of your guests details. The UI is very basic, so it needed a lot of stylizing and customizing the CSS was a bit tricky to target all of the elements. I managed to make it look nice enough for my wedding website and very pleased with the results!

No place to add an event. Could not find a place elsewhere either.

This is great. It’s not busy with a bunch of features, it does one thing, but it does it well.

I’m not a reviewer (normally) but I wanted to add an event to gauge number of RSVPs. I just wanted to publish the URL.. However, there isn’t one that I could find and adding an “event” as previous user explained seems not to exist.. Difficult. Uninstalled.

Here is a screen shot of the Events page. No place to add an event. Could not find a place elsewhere either. Get Buy PRO in your face at every turn. I found it unusable in the free form. Did not pay for the other.
