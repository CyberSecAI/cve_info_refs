The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, and it is related to CVE-2017-18851.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a post-authentication command injection vulnerability present in the firmware of certain Netgear routers and modem routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw. This implies that an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system through a vulnerable parameter or input field after successfully authenticating.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This can lead to a variety of impacts, including:
* Full control of the router
* Data breaches
* Denial of service
* Malicious network activity

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web management interface of the affected routers. An attacker with valid user credentials can exploit the flaw.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be authenticated to the router's web management interface to exploit this vulnerability. This implies that an attacker needs to have valid login credentials for a user on the affected device.

The advisory also provides a list of affected products and their corresponding vulnerable firmware versions:
* D8500 running firmware versions 1.0.3.28 and earlier
* R6400 running firmware versions 1.0.1.22 and earlier
* R6400v2 running firmware versions 1.0.2.18Â and earlier
* R8300 running firmware versions 1.0.2.94 and earlier
* R8500 running firmware versions 1.0.2.94 and earlier
* R6100 running firmware versions 1.0.1.12 and earlier
It also recommends updating to the latest firmware to fix the vulnerability.
