Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-18202:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `__oom_reap_task_mm` function within the Linux kernel's memory management (`mm/oom_kill.c`). This function, which is part of the out-of-memory (OOM) reaper mechanism, mishandles Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) gathering operations. Specifically, when gathering TLB entries for the entire virtual memory space (`tlb_gather_mmu(&tlb, mm, 0, -1)`), it sets `tlb->fullmm` to true. Certain architectures, like arm64, avoid flushing the TLB when `tlb->fullmm` is true, leading to inconsistencies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **TLB Entry Leak:** On architectures that do not flush TLB entries when `tlb->fullmm` is true (e.g., arm64), TLB entries for freed pages may persist.
2.  **Use-After-Free:**  A window exists where `complete_signal()` sends an IPI to other cores, and the OOM reaper may call `tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly()` to flush the TLB. Due to the above issue, the TLB entries are not flushed on architectures like arm64. Subsequently, other threads might access these freed pages through the stale TLB entries.  Furthermore, a `copy_to_user()` operation could write to these pages without triggering a page fault, leading to a use-after-free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could trigger this vulnerability, potentially leading to the following:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By causing a TLB entry leak or triggering a use-after-free, an attacker could destabilize the system, potentially causing crashes or system hangs.
*   **Information Leak:** It is implied in the commit message, a kernel uaccess could potentially not fault and hit in the TLB leading to data leaks.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The original bug report and commit message also mention the possibility of "unspecified other impact" due to a copy\_to\_user call within a certain time window, which suggest there may be exploitable conditions beyond DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector involves:

1.  **Triggering the OOM Reaper:** An attacker needs to create a situation where the system's memory is exhausted, forcing the OOM killer to kill processes, and subsequently trigger the oom reaper.
2.  **Exploiting the TLB Handling Issue:** The vulnerability is then triggered due to incorrect TLB handling in the `__oom_reap_task_mm` function, specifically when a full mm is being reaped.
3.  **Triggering the Use-After-Free:** By exploiting the timing window mentioned above, coupled with a `copy_to_user()` call an attacker can trigger the use-after-free.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Exhaust System Memory:**  An attacker needs to be able to trigger OOM conditions, either by directly consuming memory or by causing other processes to do so.
*   **Knowledge of Timing Window:** Exploiting the use-after-free requires an understanding of the timing window after `complete_signal()` and before threads using the freed mm structure are kicked off from other cores.
*   **Ability to Trigger Copy-to-User:** The attacker will need to trigger a copy\_to\_user() call to achieve a use-after-free.

**Mitigation:**

The patch for this vulnerability modifies `__oom_reap_task_mm` to gather TLB entries for each virtual memory area (VMA) individually instead of the full mm. This prevents the `tlb->fullmm` flag from being set, thus avoiding the TLB flush issues. This also makes the behavior of the oom reaper similar to unmapping before do\_exit, making it safe for all architectures.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix was backported to Linux kernel versions 4.14.4.
*   Red Hat also released a security advisory (RHSA-2018:2772) to address the vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
*   The vulnerability affects architectures where the TLB flush behavior is different when `fullmm` is set, such as arm64.

In summary, CVE-2017-18202 is a use-after-free vulnerability stemming from incorrect TLB management in the Linux kernel's OOM reaper, which could be exploited to cause denial of service, information leaks, or potentially other unspecified impact. The fix involves gathering TLB entries per VMA rather than per full mm to avoid architecture specific TLB handling issues.
