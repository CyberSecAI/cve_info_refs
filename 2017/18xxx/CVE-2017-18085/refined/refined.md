- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `viewdefaultdecorator` resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, potentially leading to malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors:** The `key` parameter of the `viewdefaultdecorator` resource is vulnerable. By crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the `key` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser session when the crafted URL is accessed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and induce a user to access it (e.g. through social engineering or compromised links).
