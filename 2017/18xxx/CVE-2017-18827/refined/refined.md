The provided content is related to a security advisory for a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in some NETGEAR fully managed switches, specifically the M4300 and M4200 series. Although this advisory does not mention a CVE ID it does address the following:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability present in the web interface of the affected NETGEAR switches.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is described as "Medium" with a CVSS v3 score of 5.2. Exploitation could lead to the execution of malicious scripts within the context of a user's browser when they interact with the vulnerable web interface, potentially leading to information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- The CVSS vector string indicates the impact is on confidentiality (C:L), integrity (I:L), and availability (A:L).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into fields of the web interface, which are then stored on the device.
- When other users access the compromised part of the web interface the malicious script will be executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log in to the web interface of the switch, implying they need high privileges (PR:H).
- User interaction is required to trigger the stored XSS, thus the UI value is set to "R" (UI:R).
- The attack is local, from within the same management network as the affected switch (AV:L).
- The scope is changed (S:C) from the application layer to the user's browser, allowing for actions outside of the direct control of the vulnerable application itself.

**Affected Products:**
- M4300-28G, M4300-52G, M4300-28G-POE+, M4300-52G-POE+, M4300-8X8F, M4300-12X12F, M4300-24X24F, M4300-24X, M4300-48X, M4200

**Mitigation:**
- Update the firmware to version 12.0.2.15 or later.

The advisory is a PSV (Product Security Vulnerability) advisory with the ID PSV-2017-1939. The corresponding CVE ID for this vulnerability is not specified in the advisory.
