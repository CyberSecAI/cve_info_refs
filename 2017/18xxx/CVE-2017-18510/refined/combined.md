## Description

**Manage and replace sidebars and other widget areas on your site with Custom Sidebars, a flexible widget area manager.**

Make custom sidebar configurations and be able to choose what widgets display on each page or post of your site.

> Need to make a **widget sticky** or fixed? Try our free [WP Sticky Anything](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sticky-menu-or-anything-on-scroll/) plugin.

Custom Sidebars works ONLY with the classic widgets screen that was used in WordPress before version 5.8. If you want to use it with version 5.8 (and above) you have to install the official [Classic Widgets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/) plugin, or enable the classic widgets interface yourself. Once the classic widgets screen is activated the plugin will work the same as before.

> Having problems setting up SSL or generating an SSL certificate? Install the free [WP Force SSL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-ssl/) plugin.

#### Display Different Sidebars on Pages and Posts

Custom Sidebars allows you to dynamically display custom widget configurations on any page, post, category, post type, or archive page.

★★★★★

  Integrates with WordPress core Widgets menu.

## Installation

There are two ways of installing the plugin:

**From the [WordPress plugins page](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/)**

1. Download the plugin, extract the zip file.
2. Upload the `custom-sidebars` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Active the plugin in the plugin menu panel in your administration area.

**From inside your WordPress installation, in the plugin section.**

1. Search for custom sidebars plugin.
2. Download it and then active it.

Once you have the plugin activated you will find all new features inside your “Widgets” screen! There you will be able to create and manage your own sidebars.

## FAQ

### Why can’t I see a widget menu?

This plugin requires your theme to have widget areas enabled, if you don’t have widget areas enabled you probably need to use a different theme that does!

### Where do I set my sidebars up?

You have a sidebar box when editing a entry. Also you can define default sidebars for different posts and archives.

### Why do I get a message ‘There are no replaceable sidebars selected’?

You can create all the sidebars you want, but you need some sidebars of your theme to be replaced by the ones that you have created. You have to select which sidebars from your theme are suitable to be replaced in the Custom Sidebars settings page and you will have them available to switch.

### Everything is working properly on Admin area, but the custom sidebars are not displayed on the site. Why?

You are probably using a theme that doesn’t load dynamic sidebars properly or doesn’t use the wp\_head() function in its header. The plugin replaces the sidebars inside that function, and many other plugins hook there, so it is [more than recommended to use it](http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/04/wordpress-theme-authors-dont-forget-the-wp_head-function/).

### It appears that only an Admin can choose to add a sidebar. How can Editors (or any other role) edit customs sidebars?

Any user that can switch themes, can create sidebars. Switch\_themes is the capability needed to manage widgets, so if you can’t edit widgets you can’t create custom sidebars. There are some plugins to give capabilities to the roles, so you can make your author be able to create the sidebars. Try [User role editor](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-role-editor/)

### Can I use the plugin in commercial projects?

Custom Sidebars has the same license as WordPress, so you can use it wherever you want for free. Yay!

Installing and activating “this” plugin, add a layer of blur canvas on whole admin pages (all pages). We can’t click on anything. The plugin can be disabled from dashboard, the only way to regain control of the website is to delete (for good) this masterpiece of software….Sadly, not only the name has changed, the developpers also. This is a bad joke….

If it works, it would be a great plugin however I encountered two major issues. – When entering existing categories, the plugin cannot find them. they will not show up in the list. – When setting the filter on what page & categorie to show the sidebar, it will ignore these filter settings and will replace the sidebar everywhere.

It was good, but suddenly I cannot see/access the widgets because of ads. I installed the advertised items, but now it is just blank where the ads were.

Custom sidebars is great plugin, but I got a notice that “Custom Sidebars plugin is NOT compatible with the new widgets edit screen (powered by Gutenberg). Install the official Classic Widgets plugin if you want to continue using it” when I update Wordpress 5.8 version.
Does anyone also have this notice? and is there any effect?
I use Flatsome Theme, and everything still looks good.
