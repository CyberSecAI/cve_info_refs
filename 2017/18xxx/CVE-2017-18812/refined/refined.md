The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2017-0298. While the advisory doesn't directly reference CVE-2017-18812, it describes a vulnerability that could potentially be related, given the timeframe and nature of the issue.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the ReadyNAS OS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the system which will be stored and executed in the context of other users accessing the vulnerable pages. This is a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the browser of other users accessing the ReadyNAS device's web interface. This could lead to various impacts, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web interface.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to inject malicious JavaScript code into a field that's not properly sanitized. When other users browse the injected content, the script is executed by their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would require some level of access to the ReadyNAS device's web interface to inject the malicious script.  The advisory indicates that this requires high privileges, specifically `PR:H`.
-  User Interaction is needed, `UI:R` from an affected user visiting the web page with the stored XSS.

**Affected products:**
- All ReadyNAS OS 6 devices running versions prior to 6.8.0 are affected. A comprehensive list of specific ReadyNAS models is included in the advisory.

**Mitigation:**
- NETGEAR recommends upgrading to the latest firmware version (6.8.0 or later) to address this vulnerability.
