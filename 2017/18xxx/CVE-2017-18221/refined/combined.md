mlock: fix mlock count can not decrease in race conditionKefeng reported that when running the follow test, the mlock count in
meminfo will increase permanently:
[1] testcase
linux:~ # cat test\_mlockal
grep Mlocked /proc/meminfo
for j in `seq 0 10`
do
for i in `seq 4 15`
do
./p\_mlockall >> log &
done
sleep 0.2
done
# wait some time to let mlock counter decrease and 5s may not enough
sleep 5
grep Mlocked /proc/meminfo
linux:~ # cat p\_mlockall.c
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define SPACE\_LEN 4096
int main(int argc, char \*\* argv)
{
int ret;
void \*adr = malloc(SPACE\_LEN);
if (!adr)
return -1;
ret = mlockall(MCL\_CURRENT | MCL\_FUTURE);
printf("mlcokall ret = %d\n", ret);
ret = munlockall();
printf("munlcokall ret = %d\n", ret);
free(adr);
return 0;
}
In \_\_munlock\_pagevec() we should decrement NR\_MLOCK for each page where
we clear the PageMlocked flag. Commit 1ebb7cc6a583 ("mm: munlock: batch
NR\_MLOCK zone state updates") has introduced a bug where we don't
decrement NR\_MLOCK for pages where we clear the flag, but fail to
isolate them from the lru list (e.g. when the pages are on some other
cpu's percpu pagevec). Since PageMlocked stays cleared, the NR\_MLOCK
accounting gets permanently disrupted by this.
Fix it by counting the number of page whose PageMlock flag is cleared.
Fixes: 1ebb7cc6a583 (" mm: munlock: batch NR\_MLOCK zone state updates")

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Jan H. Sch√∂nherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle

block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm

could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2017-12134](/security/CVE-2017-12134))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-13220](/security/CVE-2017-13220))

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device

driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18079](/security/CVE-2017-18079))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18221](/security/CVE-2017-18221))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3655-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added mitigations in the Linux

kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding

updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

14.04 LTS for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Jan H. Sch√∂nherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle

block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm

could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2017-12134](/security/CVE-2017-12134))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-13220](/security/CVE-2017-13220))

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device

driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18079](/security/CVE-2017-18079))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18221](/security/CVE-2017-18221))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.149.140](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-149.199~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.149.140](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-149.199~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact

the cloud provider to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated

to expose the new CPU features to virtual machines.

Kefeng reported that when running the follow test, the mlock count in
meminfo will increase permanently:

 [1] testcase
 linux:~ # cat test_mlockal
 grep Mlocked /proc/meminfo
  for j in `seq 0 10`
  do
 	for i in `seq 4 15`
 	do
 		./p_mlockall >> log &
 	done
 	sleep 0.2
 done
 # wait some time to let mlock counter decrease and 5s may not enough
 sleep 5
 grep Mlocked /proc/meminfo

 linux:~ # cat p_mlockall.c
 #include <sys/mman.h>
 #include <stdlib.h>
 #include <stdio.h>

 #define SPACE_LEN	4096

 int main(int argc, char ** argv)
 {
	 	int ret;
	 	void *adr = malloc(SPACE_LEN);
	 	if (!adr)
	 		return -1;

	 	ret = mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE);
	 	printf("mlcokall ret = %d\n", ret);

	 	ret = munlockall();
	 	printf("munlcokall ret = %d\n", ret);

	 	free(adr);
	 	return 0;
	 }

In __munlock_pagevec() we should decrement NR_MLOCK for each page where
we clear the PageMlocked flag.  Commit [1ebb7cc](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1ebb7cc6a58321a4b22c4c9097b4651b0ab859d0) ("mm: munlock: batch
NR_MLOCK zone state updates") has introduced a bug where we don't
decrement NR_MLOCK for pages where we clear the flag, but fail to
isolate them from the lru list (e.g.  when the pages are on some other
cpu's percpu pagevec).  Since PageMlocked stays cleared, the NR_MLOCK
accounting gets permanently disrupted by this.

Fix it by counting the number of page whose PageMlock flag is cleared.

Fixes: [1ebb7cc](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1ebb7cc6a58321a4b22c4c9097b4651b0ab859d0) (" mm: munlock: batch NR_MLOCK zone state updates")

## [Variant4](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/Variant4)

## Speculative Store Bypass (CVE-2018-3639 aka GPZ Variant 4)

Ken Johnson of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) and Jann Horn of Google Project Zero (GPZ) independently [discovered another variant](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1528) of a cache speculation timing side channel attack, similar to the issues previously disclosed under the names [Spectre and Meltdown](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown).

With this variant, currently known as Variant 4, systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and speculative execution of a memory read, before the addresses of all prior memory writes are known, may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side channel analysis. More colloquially, in one example, Variant 4 can reveal the value of stored data when a load following a store speculatively retrieves the earlier value.

### Mitigations

Some mitigations for Spectre v2 also help to mitigate some of the effects of this vulnerability, for example, the reduction in timer precision in browsers renders this variant much more difficult to exploit.

The Speculative Store Bypass vulnerability can be mitigated by setting the newly defined Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) bit in the IA32\_SPEC\_CTRL Model-Specific Register (MSR) of x86 processors. Support for this mitigation requires updated microcode for Intel processors. New microcode is not needed for AMD processors.

In Ubuntu, SSBD is OFF by default because it is not needed by most programs and carries a notable performance impact. A prctl() has been added (PR\_SPEC\_STORE\_BYPASS) that enables developers to opt into the mitigation on a per process basis. Applications using a seccomp filter will be implicitly opted into the mitigations. This means that strict and devmode snaps, processes inside of LXD containers, sandboxed processes of the Firefox and Chromium browsers, among some other processes running in a default Ubuntu install on x86 processors, will have the SSBD mitigation enabled out of the box.

Users can explicitly opt-in to SSBD mitigations, on a system-wide basis, by booting with the spec\_store\_bypass\_disable=on boot parameter. See the [Mitigation Controls](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown/MitigationControls#CVE-2018-3639) page for details on available boot options.

### Update Status

Ubuntu users are recommended to update to the latest kernel, qemu, libvirt, and intel-microcode packages. Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 17.10, 16.04 LTS, and 14.04 LTS were affected. 12.04 ESM remains affected but updates are in progress.

#### Bare Metal and Virtual Machines with Intel Processors

QEMU and kernel updates were released to allow bare metal Ubuntu systems to make use of SSBD. Additionally, these updates allow virtualized Ubuntu systems to make use of SSBD with x86 Intel processors. Consult the following table for version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3652-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3652-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (17.10) | [USN-3653-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3653-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3654-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3654-1/), [USN-3653-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3653-2/) |
| Linux Kernel (14.04 LTS) | [USN-3655-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3655-1/), [USN-3654-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3654-2/) |
| QEMU | [USN-3651-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3651-1/) |
| intel-microcode | [USN-3756-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3756-1/) |

The required intel-microcode updates are not available at this time. Canonical will continue to work with Intel and release intel-microcode updates once they're production ready. In the meantime, you may be able to access updated microcode for your processor in the form of OEM firmware updates.

#### Virtual Machines with AMD Processors

Additional QEMU, libvirt, and kernel updates were released to allow virtual machines to make use of SSBD support with x86 AMD processors. Consult the following table for version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3678-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-1/), [USN-3678-3](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-3/) |
| Linux Kernel (17.10) | [USN-3677-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3677-1/) |
| Linux Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3676-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3676-1/), [USN-3677-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3677-2/), [USN-3678-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3678-2/) |
| Linux Kernel (14.04 LTS) | [USN-3674-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3674-1/), [USN-3676-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3676-2/) |
| QEMU | [USN-3679-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3679-1/) |
| libvirt | [USN-3680-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3680-1/) |

#### ARM64 Processors

Kernel updates were released to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to address CVE-2018-3639 on some ARM64 processors. The updated kernels will dynamically mitigate the speculative store bypass vulnerability on [Cortex-A76](https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability) and the Cavium [ThunderX2](/ThunderX2) processor family with the appropriate firmware update. Consult the following table for Ubuntu kernel version information:

| **Package** | **USN** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Kernel (18.04 LTS) | [USN-3777-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3777-1/) |
| Linux HWE Kernel (16.04 LTS) | [USN-3777-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3777-2/) |

### Verifying Your System

To check if your system is protected against CVE-2018-3639, you can run the following command and compare the output:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  Mitigation: Speculative Store Bypass disabled via prctl and seccomp
```

The example above shows a system that is mitigated against CVE-2018-3639.

A system that is not running an updated kernel will not have the file indicating the vulnerability status and the system should be considered vulnerable:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  cat: /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass: No such file or directory
```

If the file exists but the system does not have updated microcode, or an updated hypervisor in the case of a virtual machine, the output will indicate that the system is vulnerable:
```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec_store_bypass
  Vulnerable
```

### Configuration as a Hypervisor

**IMPORTANT:** As outlined above using ssbd is not strictly required, but as a hypervisor you might want/need to leave the decision to opt into this feature to your guests. To be able to do so you need to make the ssbd feature available to them.

#### QEMU/KVM

From QEMUs point of view the ssbd CPU feature is not part of any pre-defined cpu models. On a Host with the required CPU microcode to support the feature it can be explicitly turned on to be usable by the guest.

You can check if the host system has the ssbd feature used to mitigate this issue with:

```
$ grep 'ssbd' /proc/cpuinfo
  flags           : ... ssbd
```

If the above is true then the ssbd feature will automatically be passed to the guest when using the CPU model host. For all other CPU models the feature needs to be added explicitly. For example if before you had used the CPU model *Haswell* the respective part of the command line would then have look like:

```
    -cpu Haswell,+ssbd
```

#### Libvirt

You can check your stack of Firmware, Kernel, QEMU and Libvirt is ready to expose the ssbd flag to guests by checking the capabilities.

```
$ virsh domcapabilities kvm | grep ssbd
    <feature policy='require' name='ssbd'/>
```

If the above is true then the ssbd feature will automatically be passed to the guest in the CPU modes host-passthrough and host-model.

In all other cases the definition of the CPU that is presented to the guest needs to be modified. You can do so in the [guests CPU element](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU). While the rest of the CPU model specification depends on your case, adding the ssbd feature is the same and will look like

```
<cpu ...
    <feature policy='require' name='ssbd'/>
</cpu>
```

**IMPORTANT:** Even if you have a configuration - for example using host-passthrough - that does not need a configuration change, still guests needs to be fully shut down and restarted to pick up the new feature flags.

There is an off-by-one error in loop termination conditions in
xfs\_find\_get\_desired\_pgoff() since 'end' may index a page beyond end of
desired range if 'endoff' is page aligned. It doesn't have any visible
effects but still it is good to fix it.

xfs: avoid mount-time deadlock in CoW extent recovery

If a malicious user corrupts the refcount btree to cause a cycle between
different levels of the tree, the next mount attempt will deadlock in
the CoW recovery routine while grabbing buffer locks. We can use the
ability to re-grab a buffer that was previous locked to a transaction to
avoid deadlocks, so do that here.

xfs: bad assertion for delalloc an extent that start at i\_size
commit 892d2a5f705723b2cb488bfb38bcbdcf83273184 upstream.
By run fsstress long enough time enough in RHEL-7, I find an
assertion failure (harder to reproduce on linux-4.11, but problem
is still there):
XFS: Assertion failed: (iflags & BMV\_IF\_DELALLOC) != 0, file: fs/xfs/xfs\_bmap\_util.c
The assertion is in xfs\_getbmap() funciton:
if (map[i].br\_startblock == DELAYSTARTBLOCK &&
--> map[i].br\_startoff <= XFS\_B\_TO\_FSB(mp, XFS\_ISIZE(ip)))
ASSERT((iflags & BMV\_IF\_DELALLOC) != 0);
When map[i].br\_startoff == XFS\_B\_TO\_FSB(mp, XFS\_ISIZE(ip)), the
startoff is just at EOF. But we only need to make sure delalloc
extents that are within EOF, not include EOF.

xfs: fix indlen accounting error on partial delalloc conversion
commit 0daaecacb83bc6b656a56393ab77a31c28139bc7 upstream.
The delalloc -> real block conversion path uses an incorrect
calculation in the case where the middle part of a delalloc extent
is being converted. This is documented as a rare situation because
XFS generally attempts to maximize contiguity by converting as much
of a delalloc extent as possible.
If this situation does occur, the indlen reservation for the two new
delalloc extents left behind by the conversion of the middle range
is calculated and compared with the original reservation. If more
blocks are required, the delta is allocated from the global block
pool. This delta value can be characterized as the difference
between the new total requirement (temp + temp2) and the currently
available reservation minus those blocks that have already been
allocated (startblockval(PREV.br\_startblock) - allocated).
The problem is that the current code does not account for previously
allocated blocks correctly. It subtracts the current allocation
count from the (new - old) delta rather than the old indlen
reservation. This means that more indlen blocks than have been
allocated end up stashed in the remaining extents and free space
accounting is broken as a result.
Fix up the calculation to subtract the allocated block count from
the original extent indlen and thus correctly allocate the
reservation delta based on the difference between the new total
requirement and the unused blocks from the original reservation.
Also remove a bogus assert that contradicts the fact that the new
indlen reservation can be larger than the original indlen
reservation.

xfs: fix use-after-free in xfs\_finish\_page\_writeback
commit 161f55efba5ddccc690139fae9373cafc3447a97 upstream.
Commit 28b783e47ad7 ("xfs: bufferhead chains are invalid after
end\_page\_writeback") fixed one use-after-free issue by
pre-calculating the loop conditionals before calling bh->b\_end\_io()
in the end\_io processing loop, but it assigned 'next' pointer before
checking end offset boundary & breaking the loop, at which point the
bh might be freed already, and caused use-after-free.
This is caught by KASAN when running fstests generic/127 on sub-page
block size XFS.

xfs: reserve enough blocks to handle btree splits when remapping
commit fe0be23e68200573de027de9b8cc2b27e7fce35e upstream.
In xfs\_reflink\_end\_cow, we erroneously reserve only enough blocks to
handle adding 1 extent. This is problematic if we fragment free space,
have to do CoW, and then have to perform multiple bmap btree expansions.
Furthermore, the BUI recovery routine doesn't reserve /any/ blocks to
handle btree splits, so log recovery fails after our first error causes
the filesystem to go down.
Therefore, refactor the transaction block reservation macros until we
have a macro that works for our deferred (re)mapping activities, and fix
both problems by using that macro.
With 1k blocks we can hit this fairly often in g/187 if the scratch fs
is big enough.

xfs: wait on new inodes during quotaoff dquot release
commit e20c8a517f259cb4d258e10b0cd5d4b30d4167a0 upstream.
The quotaoff operation has a race with inode allocation that results
in a livelock. An inode allocation that occurs before the quota
status flags are updated acquires the appropriate dquots for the
inode via xfs\_qm\_vop\_dqalloc(). It then inserts the XFS\_INEW inode
into the perag radix tree, sometime later attaches the dquots to the
inode and finally clears the XFS\_INEW flag. Quotaoff expects to
release the dquots from all inodes in the filesystem via
xfs\_qm\_dqrele\_all\_inodes(). This invokes the AG inode iterator,
which skips inodes in the XFS\_INEW state because they are not fully
constructed. If the scan occurs after dquots have been attached to
an inode, but before XFS\_INEW is cleared, the newly allocated inode
will continue to hold a reference to the applicable dquots. When
quotaoff invokes xfs\_qm\_dqpurge\_all(), the reference count of those
dquot(s) remain elevated and the dqpurge scan spins indefinitely.
To address this problem, update the xfs\_qm\_dqrele\_all\_inodes() scan
to wait on inodes marked on the XFS\_INEW state. We wait on the
inodes explicitly rather than skip and retry to avoid continuous
retry loops due to a parallel inode allocation workload. Since
quotaoff updates the quota state flags and uses a synchronous
transaction before the dqrele scan, and dquots are attached to
inodes after radix tree insertion iff quota is enabled, one INEW
waiting pass through the AG guarantees that the scan has processed
all inodes that could possibly hold dquot references.

xfs: update ag iterator to support wait on new inodes
commit ae2c4ac2dd39b23a87ddb14ceddc3f2872c6aef5 upstream.
The AG inode iterator currently skips new inodes as such inodes are
inserted into the inode radix tree before they are fully
constructed. Certain contexts require the ability to wait on the
construction of new inodes, however. The fs-wide dquot release from
the quotaoff sequence is an example of this.
Update the AG inode iterator to support the ability to wait on
inodes flagged with XFS\_INEW upon request. Create a new
xfs\_inode\_ag\_iterator\_flags() interface and support a set of
iteration flags to modify the iteration behavior. When the
XFS\_AGITER\_INEW\_WAIT flag is set, include XFS\_INEW flags in the
radix tree inode lookup and wait on them before the callback is
executed.

Inodes that are inserted into the perag tree but still under

The runtime quotaoff sequence introduces a context that must wait

xfs: prevent multi-fsb dir readahead from reading random blocks
commit cb52ee334a45ae6c78a3999e4b473c43ddc528f4 upstream.
Directory block readahead uses a complex iteration mechanism to map
between high-level directory blocks and underlying physical extents.
This mechanism attempts to traverse the higher-level dir blocks in a
manner that handles multi-fsb directory blocks and simultaneously
maintains a reference to the corresponding physical blocks.
This logic doesn't handle certain (discontiguous) physical extent
layouts correctly with multi-fsb directory blocks. For example,
consider the case of a 4k FSB filesystem with a 2 FSB (8k) directory
block size and a directory with the following extent layout:
EXT: FILE-OFFSET BLOCK-RANGE AG AG-OFFSET TOTAL
0: [0..7]: 88..95 0 (88..95) 8
1: [8..15]: 80..87 0 (80..87) 8
2: [16..39]: 168..191 0 (168..191) 24
3: [40..63]: 5242952..5242975 1 (72..95) 24
Directory block 0 spans physical extents 0 and 1, dirblk 1 lies
entirely within extent 2 and dirblk 2 spans extents 2 and 3. Because
extent 2 is larger than the directory block size, the readahead code
erroneously assumes the block is contiguous and issues a readahead
based on the physical mapping of the first fsb of the dirblk. This
results in read verifier failure and a spurious corruption or crc
failure, depending on the filesystem format.
Further, the subsequent readahead code responsible for walking
through the physical table doesn't correctly advance the physical
block reference for dirblk 2. Instead of advancing two physical
filesystem blocks, the first iteration of the loop advances 1 block
(correctly), but the subsequent iteration advances 2 more physical
blocks because the next physical extent (extent 3, above) happens to
cover more than dirblk 2. At this point, the higher-level directory
block walking is completely off the rails of the actual physical
layout of the directory for the respective mapping table.
Update the contiguous dirblock logic to consider the current offset
in the physical extent to avoid issuing directory readahead to
unrelated blocks. Also, update the mapping table advancing code to
consider the current offset within the current dirblock to avoid
advancing the mapping reference too far beyond the dirblock.

xfs: handle array index overrun in xfs\_dir2\_leaf\_readbuf()
commit 023cc840b40fad95c6fe26fff1d380a8c9d45939 upstream.
Carlos had a case where "find" seemed to start spinning
forever and never return.
This was on a filesystem with non-default multi-fsb (8k)
directory blocks, and a fragmented directory with extents
like this:
0:[0,133646,2,0]
1:[2,195888,1,0]
2:[3,195890,1,0]
3:[4,195892,1,0]
4:[5,195894,1,0]
5:[6,195896,1,0]
6:[7,195898,1,0]
7:[8,195900,1,0]
8:[9,195902,1,0]
9:[10,195908,1,0]
10:[11,195910,1,0]
11:[12,195912,1,0]
12:[13,195914,1,0]
...
i.e. the first extent is a contiguous 2-fsb dir block, but
after that it is fragmented into 1 block extents.
At the top of the readdir path, we allocate a mapping array
which (for this filesystem geometry) can hold 10 extents; see
the assignment to map\_info->map\_size. During readdir, we are
therefore able to map extents 0 through 9 above into the array
for readahead purposes. If we count by 2, we see that the last
mapped index (9) is the first block of a 2-fsb directory block.
At the end of xfs\_dir2\_leaf\_readbuf() we have 2 loops to fill
more readahead; the outer loop assumes one full dir block is
processed each loop iteration, and an inner loop that ensures
that this is so by advancing to the next extent until a full
directory block is mapped.
The problem is that this inner loop may step past the last
extent in the mapping array as it tries to reach the end of
the directory block. This will read garbage for the extent
length, and as a result the loop control variable 'j' may
become corrupted and never fail the loop conditional.
The number of valid mappings we have in our array is stored
in map->map\_valid, so stop this inner loop based on that limit.
There is an ASSERT at the top of the outer loop for this
same condition, but we never made it out of the inner loop,
so the ASSERT never fired.
Huge appreciation for Carlos for debugging and isolating
the problem.

commit 3b4683c294095b5f777c03307ef8c60f47320e12 upstream.
Lockdep complains about use of the iolock in inode reclaim context
because it doesn't understand that reclaim has the last reference to
the inode, and thus an iolock->reclaim->iolock deadlock is not
possible.
The iolock is technically not necessary in xfs\_inactive() and was
only added to appease an assert in xfs\_free\_eofblocks(), which can
be called from other non-reclaim contexts. Therefore, just kill the
assert and drop the use of the iolock from reclaim context to quiet
lockdep.

xfs: use dedicated log worker wq to avoid deadlock with cil wq
commit 696a562072e3c14bcd13ae5acc19cdf27679e865 upstream.
The log covering background task used to be part of the xfssyncd
workqueue. That workqueue was removed as of commit 5889608df ("xfs:
syncd workqueue is no more") and the associated work item scheduled
to the xfs-log wq. The latter is used for log buffer I/O completion.
Since xfs\_log\_worker() can invoke a log flush, a deadlock is
possible between the xfs-log and xfs-cil workqueues. Consider the
following codepath from xfs\_log\_worker():
xfs\_log\_worker()
xfs\_log\_force()
\_xfs\_log\_force()
xlog\_cil\_force()
xlog\_cil\_force\_lsn()
xlog\_cil\_push\_now()
flush\_work()
The above is in xfs-log wq context and blocked waiting on the
completion of an xfs-cil work item. Concurrently, the cil push in
progress can end up blocked here:
xlog\_cil\_push\_work()
xlog\_cil\_push()
xlog\_write()
xlog\_state\_get\_iclog\_space()
xlog\_wait(&log->l\_flush\_wait, ...)
The above is in xfs-cil context waiting on log buffer I/O
completion, which executes in xfs-log wq context. In this scenario
both workqueues are deadlocked waiting on eachother.
Add a new workqueue specifically for the high level log covering and
ail pushing worker, as was the case prior to commit 5889608df.

xfs: fix off-by-one on max nr\_pages in xfs\_find\_get\_desired\_pgoff()
commit 8affebe16d79ebefb1d9d6d56a46dc89716f9453 upstream.
xfs\_find\_get\_desired\_pgoff() is used to search for offset of hole or
data in page range [index, end] (both inclusive), and the max number
of pages to search should be at least one, if end == index.
Otherwise the only page is missed and no hole or data is found,
which is not correct.
When block size is smaller than page size, this can be demonstrated
by preallocating a file with size smaller than page size and writing
data to the last block. E.g. run this xfs\_io command on a 1k block
size XFS on x86\_64 host.
# xfs\_io -fc "falloc 0 3k" -c "pwrite 2k 1k" \
-c "seek -d 0" /mnt/xfs/testfile
wrote 1024/1024 bytes at offset 2048
1 KiB, 1 ops; 0.0000 sec (33.675 MiB/sec and 34482.7586 ops/sec)
Whence Result
DATA EOF
Data at offset 2k was missed, and lseek(2) returned ENXIO.
This is uncovered by generic/285 subtest 07 and 08 on ppc64 host,
where pagesize is 64k. Because a recent change to generic/285
reduced the preallocated file size to smaller than 64k.

xfs: use ->b\_state to fix buffer I/O accounting release race
commit 63db7c815bc0997c29e484d2409684fdd9fcd93b upstream.
We've had user reports of unmount hangs in xfs\_wait\_buftarg() that
analysis shows is due to btp->bt\_io\_count == -1. bt\_io\_count
represents the count of in-flight asynchronous buffers and thus
should always be >= 0. xfs\_wait\_buftarg() waits for this value to
stabilize to zero in order to ensure that all untracked (with
respect to the lru) buffers have completed I/O processing before
unmount proceeds to tear down in-core data structures.
The value of -1 implies an I/O accounting decrement race. Indeed,
the fact that xfs\_buf\_ioacct\_dec() is called from xfs\_buf\_rele()
(where the buffer lock is no longer held) means that bp->b\_flags can
be updated from an unsafe context. While a user-level reproducer is
currently not available, some intrusive hacks to run racing buffer
lookups/ioacct/releases from multiple threads was used to
successfully manufacture this problem.
Existing callers do not expect to acquire the buffer lock from
xfs\_buf\_rele(). Therefore, we can not safely update ->b\_flags from
this context. It turns out that we already have separate buffer
state bits and associated serialization for dealing with buffer LRU
state in the form of ->b\_state and ->b\_lock. Therefore, replace the
\_XBF\_IN\_FLIGHT flag with a ->b\_state variant, update the I/O
accounting wrappers appropriately and make sure they are used with
the correct locking. This ensures that buffer in-flight state can be
modified at buffer release time without racing with modifications
from a buffer lock holder.

commit 82bc9a42cf854fdf63155759c0aa790bd1f361b0 upstream.
With LVDS we were incorrectly picking the pre-programmed mode instead of
the prefered mode provided by VBT. Make sure we pick the VBT mode if
one is provided. It is likely that the mode read-out code is still wrong
but this patch fixes the immediate problem on most machines.

slub/memcg: cure the brainless abuse of sysfs attributes
commit 478fe3037b2278d276d4cd9cd0ab06c4cb2e9b32 upstream.
memcg\_propagate\_slab\_attrs() abuses the sysfs attribute file functions
to propagate settings from the root kmem\_cache to a newly created
kmem\_cache. It does that with:
attr->show(root, buf);
attr->store(new, buf, strlen(bug);
Aside of being a lazy and absurd hackery this is broken because it does
not check the return value of the show() function.
Some of the show() functions return 0 w/o touching the buffer. That
means in such a case the store function is called with the stale content
of the previous show(). That causes nonsense like invoking
kmem\_cache\_shrink() on a newly created kmem\_cache. In the worst case it
would cause handing in an uninitialized buffer.
This should be rewritten proper by adding a propagate() callback to
those slub\_attributes which must be propagated and avoid that insane
conversion to and from ASCII, but that's too large for a hot fix.
Check at least the return value of the show() function, so calling
store() with stale content is prevented.

ksm: prevent crash after write\_protect\_page fails
commit a7306c3436e9c8e584a4b9fad5f3dc91be2a6076 upstream.
"err" needs to be left set to -EFAULT if split\_huge\_page succeeds.
Otherwise if "err" gets clobbered with zero and write\_protect\_page
fails, try\_to\_merge\_one\_page() will succeed instead of returning -EFAULT
and then try\_to\_merge\_with\_ksm\_page() will continue thinking kpage is a
PageKsm when in fact it's still an anonymous page. Eventually it'll
crash in page\_add\_anon\_rmap.
This has been reproduced on Fedora25 kernel but I can reproduce with
upstream too.
The bug was introduced in commit f765f540598a ("ksm: prepare to new THP
semantics") introduced in v4.5.

RDMA/qib,hfi1: Fix MR reference count leak on write with immediate
commit 1feb40067cf04ae48d65f728d62ca255c9449178 upstream.
The handling of IB\_RDMA\_WRITE\_ONLY\_WITH\_IMMEDIATE will leak a memory
reference when a buffer cannot be allocated for returning the immediate
data.
The issue is that the rkey validation has already occurred and the RNR
nak fails to release the reference that was fruitlessly gotten. The
the peer will send the identical single packet request when its RNR
timer pops.
The fix is to release the held reference prior to the rnr nak exit.
This is the only sequence the requires both rkey validation and the
buffer allocation on the same packet.

the reason is that the managed memory is too low (only 110MB) while the
rest of the the 50GB is still waiting for the deferred intialization to
be done. update\_defer\_init estimates the initial memoty to initialize
to 2GB at least but it doesn't consider any memory allocated in that
range. In this particular case we've had
Reserving 4096MB of memory at 128MB for crashkernel (System RAM: 51200MB)
so the low 2GB is mostly depleted.
Fix this by considering memblock allocations in the initial static
initialization estimation. Move the max\_initialise to
reset\_deferred\_meminit and implement a simple memblock\_reserved\_memory
helper which iterates all reserved blocks and sums the size of all that
start below the given address. The cumulative size is than added on top
of the initial estimation. This is still not ideal because
reset\_deferred\_meminit doesn't consider holes and so reservation might
be above the initial estimation whihch we ignore but let's make the
logic simpler until we really need to handle more complicated cases.

mm/hugetlb: report -EHWPOISON not -EFAULT when FOLL\_HWPOISON is specified
commit 9a291a7c9428155e8e623e4a3989f8be47134df5 upstream.
KVM uses get\_user\_pages() to resolve its stage2 faults. KVM sets the
FOLL\_HWPOISON flag causing faultin\_page() to return -EHWPOISON when it
finds a VM\_FAULT\_HWPOISON. KVM handles these hwpoison pages as a
special case. (check\_user\_page\_hwpoison())
When huge pages are involved, this doesn't work so well.
get\_user\_pages() calls follow\_hugetlb\_page(), which stops early if it
receives VM\_FAULT\_HWPOISON from hugetlb\_fault(), eventually returning
-EFAULT to the caller. The step to map this to -EHWPOISON based on the
FOLL\_ flags is missing. The hwpoison special case is skipped, and
-EFAULT is returned to user-space, causing Qemu or kvmtool to exit.
Instead, move this VM\_FAULT\_ to errno mapping code into a header file
and use it from faultin\_page() and follow\_hugetlb\_page().
With this, KVM works as expected.
This isn't a problem for arm64 today as we haven't enabled
MEMORY\_FAILURE, but I can't see any reason this doesn't happen on x86
too, so I think this should be a fix. This doesn't apply earlier than
stable's v4.11.1 due to all sorts of cleanup.

mlock: fix mlock count can not decrease in race condition
commit 70feee0e1ef331b22cc51f383d532a0d043fbdcc upstream.
Kefeng reported that when running the follow test, the mlock count in
meminfo will increase permanently:
[1] testcase
linux:~ # cat test\_mlockal
grep Mlocked /proc/meminfo
for j in `seq 0 10`
do
for i in `seq 4 15`
do
./p\_mlockall >> log &
done
sleep 0.2
done
# wait some time to let mlock counter decrease and 5s may not enough
sleep 5
grep Mlocked /proc/meminfo
linux:~ # cat p\_mlockall.c
#include
#include
#include
#define SPACE\_LEN 4096
int main(int argc, char \*\* argv)
{
int ret;
void \*adr = malloc(SPACE\_LEN);
if (!adr)
return -1;
ret = mlockall(MCL\_CURRENT | MCL\_FUTURE);
printf("mlcokall ret = %d\n", ret);
ret = munlockall();
printf("munlcokall ret = %d\n", ret);
free(adr);
return 0;
}
In \_\_munlock\_pagevec() we should decrement NR\_MLOCK for each page where
we clear the PageMlocked flag. Commit 1ebb7cc6a583 ("mm: munlock: batch
NR\_MLOCK zone state updates") has introduced a bug where we don't
decrement NR\_MLOCK for pages where we clear the flag, but fail to
isolate them from the lru list (e.g. when the pages are on some other
cpu's percpu pagevec). Since PageMlocked stays cleared, the NR\_MLOCK
accounting gets permanently disrupted by this.
Fix it by counting the number of page whose PageMlock flag is cleared.

mm/migrate: fix refcount handling when !hugepage\_migration\_supported()
commit 30809f559a0d348c2dfd7ab05e9a451e2384962e upstream.
On failing to migrate a page, soft\_offline\_huge\_page() performs the
necessary update to the hugepage ref-count.
But when !hugepage\_migration\_supported() , unmap\_and\_move\_hugepage()
also decrements the page ref-count for the hugepage. The combined
behaviour leaves the ref-count in an inconsistent state.
This leads to soft lockups when running the overcommitted hugepage test
from mce-tests suite.

dax: fix race between colliding PMD & PTE entries
commit e2093926a098a8ccf0f1d10f6df8dad452cb28d3 upstream.
We currently have two related PMD vs PTE races in the DAX code. These
can both be easily triggered by having two threads reading and writing
simultaneously to the same private mapping, with the key being that
private mapping reads can be handled with PMDs but private mapping
writes are always handled with PTEs so that we can COW.
Here is the first race:
CPU 0 CPU 1
(private mapping write)
\_\_handle\_mm\_fault()
create\_huge\_pmd() - FALLBACK
handle\_pte\_fault()
passes check for pmd\_devmap()
(private mapping read)
\_\_handle\_mm\_fault()
create\_huge\_pmd()
dax\_iomap\_pmd\_fault() inserts PMD
dax\_iomap\_pte\_fault() does a PTE fault, but we already have a DAX PMD
installed in our page tables at this spot.
Here's the second race:
CPU 0 CPU 1
(private mapping read)
\_\_handle\_mm\_fault()
passes check for pmd\_none()
create\_huge\_pmd()
dax\_iomap\_pmd\_fault() inserts PMD
(private mapping write)
\_\_handle\_mm\_fault()
create\_huge\_pmd() - FALLBACK
(private mapping read)
\_\_handle\_mm\_fault()
passes check for pmd\_none()
create\_huge\_pmd()
handle\_pte\_fault()
dax\_iomap\_pte\_fault() inserts PTE
dax\_iomap\_pmd\_fault() inserts PMD,
but we already have a PTE at
this spot.
The core of the issue is that while there is isolation between faults to
the same range in the DAX fault handlers via our DAX entry locking,
there is no isolation between faults in the code in mm/memory.c. This
means for instance that this code in \_\_handle\_mm\_fault() can run:
if (pmd\_none(\*vmf.pmd) && transparent\_hugepage\_enabled(vma)) {
ret = create\_huge\_pmd(&vmf);
But by the time we actually get to run the fault handler called by
create\_huge\_pmd(), the PMD is no longer pmd\_none() because a racing PTE
fault has installed a normal PMD here as a parent. This is the cause of
the 2nd race. The first race is similar - there is the following check
in handle\_pte\_fault():
} else {
/\* See comment in pte\_alloc\_one\_map() \*/
if (pmd\_devmap(\*vmf->pmd) || pmd\_trans\_unstable(vmf->pmd))
return 0;
So if a pmd\_devmap() PMD (a DAX PMD) has been installed at vmf->pmd, we
will bail and retry the fault. This is correct, but there is nothing
preventing the PMD from being installed after this check but before we
actually get to the DAX PTE fault handlers.
In my testing these races result in the following types of errors:
BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff8800a817d280 idx:1 val:1
BUG: non-zero nr\_ptes on freeing mm: 15
Fix this issue by having the DAX fault handlers verify that it is safe
to continue their fault after they have taken an entry lock to block
other racing faults.

mm: avoid spurious 'bad pmd' warning messages
commit d0f0931de936a0a468d7e59284d39581c16d3a73 upstream.
When the pmd\_devmap() checks were added by 5c7fb56e5e3f ("mm, dax:
dax-pmd vs thp-pmd vs hugetlbfs-pmd") to add better support for DAX huge
pages, they were all added to the end of if() statements after existing
pmd\_trans\_huge() checks. So, things like:
- if (pmd\_trans\_huge(\*pmd))
+ if (pmd\_trans\_huge(\*pmd) || pmd\_devmap(\*pmd))
When further checks were added after pmd\_trans\_unstable() checks by

page to map") they were also added at the end of the conditional:
+ if (pmd\_trans\_unstable(fe->pmd) || pmd\_devmap(\*fe->pmd))
This ordering is fine for pmd\_trans\_huge(), but doesn't work for
pmd\_trans\_unstable(). This is because DAX huge pages trip the bad\_pmd()
check inside of pmd\_none\_or\_trans\_huge\_or\_clear\_bad() (called by
pmd\_trans\_unstable()), which prints out a warning and returns 1. So, we
do end up doing the right thing, but only after spamming dmesg with
suspicious looking messages:
mm/pgtable-generic.c:39: bad pmd ffff8808daa49b88(84000001006000a5)
Reorder these checks in a helper so that pmd\_devmap() is checked first,
avoiding the error messages, and add a comment explaining why the
ordering is important.

mm/page\_alloc.c: make sure OOM victim can try allocations with no watermarks once

There is a race window that the OOM reaper completes reclaiming the
first victim's memory while nothing but mutex\_trylock() prevents the
first victim from calling out\_of\_memory() from pagefault\_out\_of\_memory()
after memory allocation for page fault path failed due to being selected
as an OOM victim.
This is a side effect of commit 9a67f6488eca926f ("mm: consolidate
GFP\_NOFAIL checks in the allocator slowpath") because that commit
silently changed the behavior from
/\* Avoid allocations with no watermarks from looping endlessly \*/
to
/\*
\* Give up allocations without trying memory reserves if selected
\* as an OOM victim
\*/
in \_\_alloc\_pages\_slowpath() by moving the location to check TIF\_MEMDIE
flag. I have noticed this change but I didn't post a patch because I
thought it is an acceptable change other than noise by warn\_alloc()
because !\_\_GFP\_NOFAIL allocations are allowed to fail. But we
overlooked that failing memory allocation from page fault path makes
difference due to the race window explained above.
While it might be possible to add a check to pagefault\_out\_of\_memory()
that prevents the first victim from calling out\_of\_memory() or remove
out\_of\_memory() from pagefault\_out\_of\_memory(), changing
pagefault\_out\_of\_memory() does not suppress noise by warn\_alloc() when
allocating thread was selected as an OOM victim. There is little point
with printing similar backtraces and memory information from both
out\_of\_memory() and warn\_alloc().
Instead, if we guarantee that current thread can try allocations with no
watermarks once when current thread looping inside
\_\_alloc\_pages\_slowpath() was selected as an OOM victim, we can follow "who
can use memory reserves" rules and suppress noise by warn\_alloc() and
prevent memory allocations from page fault path from calling
pagefault\_out\_of\_memory().
If we take the comment literally, this patch would do
- if (test\_thread\_flag(TIF\_MEMDIE))
- goto nopage;
+ if (alloc\_flags == ALLOC\_NO\_WATERMARKS || (gfp\_mask & \_\_GFP\_NOMEMALLOC))
+ goto nopage;
because gfp\_pfmemalloc\_allowed() returns false if \_\_GFP\_NOMEMALLOC is
given. But if I recall correctly (I couldn't find the message), the
condition is meant to apply to only OOM victims despite the comment.
Therefore, this patch preserves TIF\_MEMDIE check.

Revert "ALSA: usb-audio: purge needless variable length array"
commit 64188cfbe5245d412de2139a3864e4e00b4136f0 upstream.
This reverts commit 89b593c30e83 ("ALSA: usb-audio: purge needless
variable length array"). The patch turned out to cause a severe
regression, triggering an Oops at snd\_usb\_ctl\_msg(). It was overseen
that snd\_usb\_ctl\_msg() writes back the response to the given buffer,
while the patch changed it to a read-only const buffer. (One should
always double-check when an extra pointer cast is present...)
As a simple fix, just revert the affected commit. It was merely a
cleanup. Although it brings VLA again, it's clearer as a fix. We'll
address the VLA later in another patch.

drm/radeon: Unbreak HPD handling for r600+
commit 3d18e33735a02b1a90aecf14410bf3edbfd4d3dc upstream.
We end up reading the interrupt register for HPD5, and then writing it
to HPD6 which on systems without anything using HPD5 results in
permanently disabling hotplug on one of the display outputs after the
first time we acknowledge a hotplug interrupt from the GPU.
This code is really bad. But for now, let's just fix this. I will
hopefully have a large patch series to refactor all of this soon.

nvme: avoid to use blk\_mq\_abort\_requeue\_list()
commit 986f75c876dbafed98eba7cb516c5118f155db23 upstream.
NVMe may add request into requeue list simply and not kick off the
requeue if hw queues are stopped. Then blk\_mq\_abort\_requeue\_list()
is called in both nvme\_kill\_queues() and nvme\_ns\_remove() for
dealing with this issue.
Unfortunately blk\_mq\_abort\_requeue\_list() is absolutely a
race maker, for example, one request may be requeued during
the aborting. So this patch just calls blk\_mq\_kick\_requeue\_list() in
nvme\_kill\_queues() to handle this issue like what nvme\_start\_queues()
does. Now all requests in requeue list when queues are stopped will be
handled by blk\_mq\_kick\_requeue\_list() when queues are restarted, either
in nvme\_start\_queues() or in nvme\_kill\_queues().

nvme: use blk\_mq\_start\_hw\_queues() in nvme\_kill\_queues()
commit 806f026f9b901eaf1a6baeb48b5da18d6a4f818e upstream.
Inside nvme\_kill\_queues(), we have to start hw queues for
draining requests in sw queues, .dispatch list and requeue list,
so use blk\_mq\_start\_hw\_queues() instead of blk\_mq\_start\_stopped\_hw\_queues()
which only run queues if queues are stopped, but the queues may have
been started already, for example nvme\_start\_queues() is called in reset work
function.
blk\_mq\_start\_hw\_queues() run hw queues in current context, instead
of running asynchronously like before. Given nvme\_kill\_queues() is
run from either remove context or reset worker context, both are fine
to run hw queue directly. And the mutex of namespaces\_mutex isn't a
problem too becasue nvme\_start\_freeze() runs hw queue in this way
already.

In the case of small NVMe-oF queue size (<32) we may enter a deadlock
caused by the fact that the IB completions aren't sent waiting for 32

The error is seen as (using mlx5):

HID: wacom: Have wacom\_tpc\_irq guard against possible NULL dereference
commit 2ac97f0f6654da14312d125005c77a6010e0ea38 upstream.
The following Smatch complaint was generated in response to commit
2a6cdbd ("HID: wacom: Introduce new 'touch\_input' device"):
drivers/hid/wacom\_wac.c:1586 wacom\_tpc\_irq()
error: we previously assumed 'wacom->touch\_input' could be null (see line 1577)
The 'touch\_input' and 'pen\_input' variables point to the 'struct input\_dev'
used for relaying touch and pen events to userspace, respectively. If a
device does not have a touch interface or pen interface, the associated
input variable is NULL. The 'wacom\_tpc\_irq()' function is responsible for
forwarding input reports to a more-specific IRQ handler function. An
unknown report could theoretically be mistaken as e.g. a touch report
on a device which does not have a touch interface. This can be prevented
by only calling the pen/touch functions are called when the pen/touch
pointers are valid.

ibmvscsis: Fix the incorrect req\_lim\_delta
commit 75dbf2d36f6b122ad3c1070fe4bf95f71bbff321 upstream.
The current code is not correctly calculating the req\_lim\_delta.
We want to make sure vscsi->credit is always incremented when
we do not send a response for the scsi op. Thus for the case where
there is a successfully aborted task we need to make sure the
vscsi->credit is incremented.
v2 - Moves the original location of the vscsi->credit increment
to a better spot. Since if we increment credit, the next command
we send back will have increased req\_lim\_delta. But we probably
shouldn't be doing that until the aborted cmd is actually released.
Otherwise the client will think that it can send a new command, and
we could find ourselves short of command elements. Not likely, but could
happen.
This patch depends on both:

iscsi-target: Fix initial login PDU asynchronous socket close OOPs
commit 25cdda95fda78d22d44157da15aa7ea34be3c804 upstream.
This patch fixes a OOPs originally introduced by:
commit bb048357dad6d604520c91586334c9c230366a14
Author: Nicholas Bellinger
Date: Thu Sep 5 14:54:04 2013 -0700
iscsi-target: Add sk->sk\_state\_change to cleanup after TCP failure
which would trigger a NULL pointer dereference when a TCP connection
was closed asynchronously via iscsi\_target\_sk\_state\_change(), but only
when the initial PDU processing in iscsi\_target\_do\_login() from iscsi\_np
process context was blocked waiting for backend I/O to complete.
To address this issue, this patch makes the following changes.
First, it introduces some common helper functions used for checking
socket closing state, checking login\_flags, and atomically checking
socket closing state + setting login\_flags.
Second, it introduces a LOGIN\_FLAGS\_INITIAL\_PDU bit to know when a TCP
connection has dropped via iscsi\_target\_sk\_state\_change(), but the
initial PDU processing within iscsi\_target\_do\_login() in iscsi\_np
context is still running. For this case, it sets LOGIN\_FLAGS\_CLOSED,
but doesn't invoke schedule\_delayed\_work().
The original NULL pointer dereference case reported by MNC is now handled
by iscsi\_target\_do\_login() doing a iscsi\_target\_sk\_check\_close() before
transitioning to FFP to determine when the socket has already closed,
or iscsi\_target\_start\_negotiation() if the login needs to exchange
more PDUs (eg: iscsi\_target\_do\_login returned 0) but the socket has
closed. For both of these cases, the cleanup up of remaining connection
resources will occur in iscsi\_target\_start\_negotiation() from iscsi\_np
process context once the failure is detected.
Finally, to handle to case where iscsi\_target\_sk\_state\_change() is
called after the initial PDU procesing is complete, it now invokes
conn->login\_work -> iscsi\_target\_do\_login\_rx() to perform cleanup once
existing iscsi\_target\_sk\_check\_close() checks detect connection failure.
For this case, the cleanup of remaining connection resources will occur
in iscsi\_target\_do\_login\_rx() from delayed workqueue process context
once the failure is detected.

iscsi-target: Always wait for kthread\_should\_stop() before kthread exit
commit 5e0cf5e6c43b9e19fc0284f69e5cd2b4a47523b0 upstream.
There are three timing problems in the kthread usages of iscsi\_target\_mod:
- np\_thread of struct iscsi\_np
- rx\_thread and tx\_thread of struct iscsi\_conn
In iscsit\_close\_connection(), it calls
send\_sig(SIGINT, conn->tx\_thread, 1);
kthread\_stop(conn->tx\_thread);
In conn->tx\_thread, which is iscsi\_target\_tx\_thread(), when it receive
SIGINT the kthread will exit without checking the return value of
kthread\_should\_stop().
So if iscsi\_target\_tx\_thread() exit right between send\_sig(SIGINT...)
and kthread\_stop(...), the kthread\_stop() will try to stop an already
stopped kthread.
This is invalid according to the documentation of kthread\_stop().

scsi: zero per-cmd private driver data for each MQ I/O
commit 1bad6c4a57efda0d5f5bf8a2403b21b1ed24875c upstream.
In lower layer driver's (LLD) scsi\_host\_template, the driver may
optionally ask SCSI to allocate its private driver memory for each
command, by specifying cmd\_size. This memory is allocated at the end of
scsi\_cmnd by SCSI. Later when SCSI queues a command, the LLD can use
scsi\_cmd\_priv to get to its private data.
Some LLD, e.g. hv\_storvsc, doesn't clear its private data before use. In
this case, the LLD may get to stale or uninitialized data in its private
driver memory. This may result in unexpected driver and hardware
behavior.
Fix this problem by also zeroing the private driver memory before
passing them to LLD.

Revert "ACPI / button: Change default behavior to lid\_init\_state=open"
commit 878d8db039daac0938238e9a40a5bd6e50ee3c9b upstream.
Revert commit 77e9a4aa9de1 (ACPI / button: Change default behavior to
lid\_init\_state=open) which changed the kernel's behavior on laptops
that boot with closed lids and expect the lid switch state to be
reported accurately by the kernel.
If you boot or resume your laptop with the lid closed on a docking
station while using an external monitor connected to it, both internal
and external displays will light on, while only the external should.
There is a design choice in gdm to only provide the greeter on the
internal display when lit on, so users only see a gray area on the
external monitor. Also, the cursor will not show up as it's by
default on the internal display too.
To "fix" that, users have to open the laptop once and close it once
again to sync the state of the switch with the hardware state.
Even if the "method" operation mode implementation can be buggy on
some platforms, the "open" choice is worse. It breaks docking
stations basically and there is no way to have a user-space hwdb to
fix that.
On the contrary, it's rather easy in user-space to have a hwdb
with the problematic platforms. Then, libinput (1.7.0+) can fix
the state of the lid switch for us: you need to set the udev
property LIBINPUT\_ATTR\_LID\_SWITCH\_RELIABILITY to 'write\_open'.
When libinput detects internal keyboard events, it will overwrite the
state of the switch to open, making it reliable again. Given that
logind only checks the lid switch value after a timeout, we can
assume the user will use the internal keyboard before this timeout
expires.
For example, such a hwdb entry is:
libinput:name:\*Lid Switch\*:dmi:\*svnMicrosoftCorporation:pnSurface3:\*
LIBINPUT\_ATTR\_LID\_SWITCH\_RELIABILITY=write\_open

ACPICA: Tables: Fix regression introduced by a too early mechanism enabling
commit 2ea65321b83539afc1d45c1bea39c55ab42af62b upstream.
In the Linux kernel, acpi\_get\_table() "clones" haven't been fully
balanced by acpi\_put\_table() invocations. In upstream ACPICA, due to
the design change, there are also unbalanced acpi\_get\_table\_by\_index()
invocations requiring special care.
acpi\_get\_table() reference counting mismatches may occor due to that
and printing error messages related to them is not useful at this
point. The strict balanced validation count check should only be
enabled after confirming that all invocations are safe and aligned
with their designed purposes.
Thus this patch removes the error value returned by acpi\_tb\_get\_table()
in that case along with the accompanying error message to fix the
issue.

Revert "ACPI / button: Remove lid\_init\_state=method mode"
commit f369fdf4f661322b73f3307e9f3cd55fb3a20123 upstream.
This reverts commit ecb10b694b72ca5ea51b3c90a71ff2a11963425a.
The only expected ACPI control method lid device's usage model is
1. Listen to the lid notification,
2. Evaluate \_LID after being notified by BIOS,
3. Suspend the system (if users configure to do so) after seeing "close".
It's not ensured that BIOS will notify OS after boot/resume, and
it's not ensured that BIOS will always generate "open" event upon
opening the lid.
But there are 2 wrong usage models:
1. When the lid device is responsible for suspend/resume the system,
userspace requires to see "open" event to be paired with "close" after
the system is resumed, or it will suspend the system again.
2. When an external monitor connects to the laptop attached docks,
userspace requires to see "close" event after the system is resumed so
that it can determine whether the internal display should remain dark
and the external display should be lit on.
After we made default kernel behavior to be suitable for usage model 1,
users of usage model 2 start to report regressions for such behavior
change.
Reversion of button.lid\_init\_state=method doesn't actually reverts to old
default behavior as doing so can enter a regression loop, but facilitates
users to work the reported regressions around with
button.lid\_init\_state=method.

drivers/tty: 8250: only call fintek\_8250\_probe when doing port I/O
commit 4c4fc90964b1cf205a67df566cc82ea1731bcb00 upstream.
Commit fa01e2ca9f53 ("serial: 8250: Integrate Fintek into 8250\_base")
modified the probing logic for PNP0501 devices, to remove a collision
between the generic 16550A driver and the Fintek driver, which reused
the same ACPI \_HID.
The Fintek device probe is now incorporated into the common 8250 probe
path, and gets called for all discovered 16550A compatible devices,
including ones that are MMIO mapped rather than IO mapped. However,
the Fintek driver assumes the port base is a I/O address, and proceeds
to probe some arbitrary offsets above it.
This is generally a wrong thing to do, but on ARM systems (having no
native port I/O), this may result in faulting accesses of completely
unrelated MMIO regions in the PCI I/O space. Given that this is at
serial probe time, this results in hard to diagnose crashes at boot.
So let's restrict the Fintek probe to devices that we know are using
port I/O in the first place.

commit aee5da7838787f8ed47f825dbe09e2812acdf97b upstream.
The port client data must be set when registering the serdev controller
or client deregistration will fail (and the serdev devices are left
registered and allocated) if the port was never opened in between.
Make sure to clear the port client data on any probe errors to avoid a
use-after-free when the client is later deregistered unconditionally
(e.g. in a tty-port deregistration helper).
Also move port client operation initialisation to registration. Note
that the client ops must be restored on failed probe.

Revert "tty\_port: register tty ports with serdev bus"
commit d3ba126a226a6b6da021ebfea444a2a807cde945 upstream.
This reverts commit 8ee3fde047589dc9c201251f07d0ca1dc776feca.
The new serdev bus hooked into the tty layer in
tty\_port\_register\_device() by registering a serdev controller instead of
a tty device whenever a serdev client is present, and by deregistering
the controller in the tty-port destructor. This is broken in several
ways:
Firstly, it leads to a NULL-pointer dereference whenever a tty driver
later deregisters its devices as no corresponding character device will
exist.
Secondly, far from every tty driver uses tty-port refcounting (e.g.
serial core) so the serdev devices might never be deregistered or
deallocated.
Thirdly, deregistering at tty-port destruction is too late as the
underlying device and structures may be long gone by then. A port is not
released before an open tty device is closed, something which a
registered serdev client can prevent from ever happening. A driver
callback while the device is gone typically also leads to crashes.
Many tty drivers even keep their ports around until the driver is
unloaded (e.g. serial core), something which even if a late callback
never happens, leads to leaks if a device is unbound from its driver and
is later rebound.
The right solution here is to add a new tty\_port\_unregister\_device()
helper and to never call tty\_device\_unregister() whenever the port has
been claimed by serdev, but since this requires modifying just about
every tty driver (and multiple subsystems) it will need to be done
incrementally.
Reverting the offending patch is the first step in fixing the broken
lifetime assumptions. A follow-up patch will add a new pair of
tty-device registration helpers, which a vetted tty driver can use to
support serdev (initially serial core). When every tty driver uses the
serdev helpers (at least for deregistration), we can add serdev
registration to tty\_port\_register\_device() again.
Note that this also fixes another issue with serdev, which currently
allocates and registers a serdev controller for every tty device
registered using tty\_port\_device\_register() only to immediately
deregister and deallocate it when the corresponding OF node or serdev
child node is missing. This should be addressed before enabling serdev
for hot-pluggable buses.

powerpc/spufs: Fix hash faults for kernel regions

Commit ac29c64089b7 ("powerpc/mm: Replace \_PAGE\_USER with

introduced check\_pte\_access() which denied kernel access to
non-\_PAGE\_PRIVILEGED pages.
However, it didn't add \_PAGE\_PRIVILEGED to the hash fault handler
for spufs' kernel accesses, so the DMAs required to establish SPE

This change adds \_PAGE\_PRIVILEGED to the hash fault handler for

powerpc: Fix booting P9 hash with CONFIG\_PPC\_RADIX\_MMU=N

Currently if you disable CONFIG\_PPC\_RADIX\_MMU you'll crash on boot on
a P9. This is because we still set MMU\_FTR\_TYPE\_RADIX via
ibm,pa-features and MMU\_FTR\_TYPE\_RADIX is what's used for code patching
in much of the asm code (ie. slb\_miss\_realmode)
This patch fixes the problem by stopping MMU\_FTR\_TYPE\_RADIX from being

We may eventually end up removing the CONFIG\_PPC\_RADIX\_MMU option
completely but until then this fixes the issue.

The incorrect UFS s\_maxsize limit became a problem as of commit

That caused files to be truncated on UFS-2 file systems because the
default maximum file size is 2GB (MAX\_NON\_LFS) and UFS didn't update it.

Greetings,
GCC 7 introduced the -Wstringop-overflow flag to detect buffer overflows
in calls to string handling functions [1][2]. Due to the way
``empty\_zero\_page'' is declared in arch/sparc/include/setup.h, this
causes a warning to trigger at compile time in the function mem\_init(),
which is subsequently converted to an error. The ensuing patch fixes
this issue and aligns the declaration of empty\_zero\_page to that of
other architectures. Thank you.
Cheers,
Orlando.

bpf: adjust verifier heuristics
[ Upstream commit 3c2ce60bdd3d57051bf85615deec04a694473840 ]
Current limits with regards to processing program paths do not
really reflect today's needs anymore due to programs becoming
more complex and verifier smarter, keeping track of more data
such as const ALU operations, alignment tracking, spilling of
PTR\_TO\_MAP\_VALUE\_ADJ registers, and other features allowing for
smarter matching of what LLVM generates.
This also comes with the side-effect that we result in fewer
opportunities to prune search states and thus often need to do
more work to prove safety than in the past due to different
register states and stack layout where we mismatch. Generally,
it's quite hard to determine what caused a sudden increase in
complexity, it could be caused by something as trivial as a
single branch somewhere at the beginning of the program where
LLVM assigned a stack slot that is marked differently throughout
other branches and thus causing a mismatch, where verifier
then needs to prove safety for the whole rest of the program.
Subsequently, programs with even less than half the insn size
limit can get rejected. We noticed that while some programs
load fine under pre 4.11, they get rejected due to hitting
limits on more recent kernels. We saw that in the vast majority
of cases (90+%) pruning failed due to register mismatches. In
case of stack mismatches, majority of cases failed due to
different stack slot types (invalid, spill, misc) rather than
differences in spilled registers.
This patch makes pruning more aggressive by also adding markers
that sit at conditional jumps as well. Currently, we only mark
jump targets for pruning. For example in direct packet access,
these are usually error paths where we bail out. We found that
adding these markers, it can reduce number of processed insns
by up to 30%. Another option is to ignore reg->id in probing
PTR\_TO\_MAP\_VALUE\_OR\_NULL registers, which can help pruning
slightly as well by up to 7% observed complexity reduction as
stand-alone. Meaning, if a previous path with register type
PTR\_TO\_MAP\_VALUE\_OR\_NULL for map X was found to be safe, then
in the current state a PTR\_TO\_MAP\_VALUE\_OR\_NULL register for
the same map X must be safe as well. Last but not least the
patch also adds a scheduling point and bumps the current limit
for instructions to be processed to a more adequate value.

bpf: fix wrong exposure of map\_flags into fdinfo for lpm
[ Upstream commit a316338cb71a3260201490e615f2f6d5c0d8fb2c ]
trie\_alloc() always needs to have BPF\_F\_NO\_PREALLOC passed in via
attr->map\_flags, since it does not support preallocation yet. We
check the flag, but we never copy the flag into trie->map.map\_flags,
which is later on exposed into fdinfo and used by loaders such as
iproute2. Latter uses this in bpf\_map\_selfcheck\_pinned() to test
whether a pinned map has the same spec as the one from the BPF obj
file and if not, bails out, which is currently the case for lpm
since it exposes always 0 as flags.
Also copy over flags in array\_map\_alloc() and stack\_map\_alloc().
They always have to be 0 right now, but we should make sure to not
miss to copy them over at a later point in time when we add actual
flags for them to use.

done
Cong Wang attempted to add back rt->fi in commit
82486aa6f1b9 ("ipv4: restore rt->fi for reference counting")
but this proved to add some issues that were complex to solve.
Instead, I suggested to add a refcount to the metrics themselves,
being a standalone object (in particular, no reference to other objects)
I tried to make this patch as small as possible to ease its backport,
instead of being super clean. Note that we believe that only ipv4 dst
need to take care of the metric refcount. But if this is wrong,
this patch adds the basic infrastructure to extend this to other
families.

ip6\_tunnel, ip6\_gre: fix setting of DSCP on encapsulated packets
[ Upstream commit 0e9a709560dbcfbace8bf4019dc5298619235891 ]
This fix addresses two problems in the way the DSCP field is formulated
on the encapsulating header of IPv6 tunnels.
Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=195661
1) The IPv6 tunneling code was manipulating the DSCP field of the
encapsulating packet using the 32b flowlabel. Since the flowlabel is
only the lower 20b it was incorrect to assume that the upper 12b
containing the DSCP and ECN fields would remain intact when formulating
the encapsulating header. This fix handles the 'inherit' and
'fixed-value' DSCP cases explicitly using the extant dsfield u8 variable.
2) The use of INET\_ECN\_encapsulate(0, dsfield) in ip6\_tnl\_xmit was
incorrect and resulted in the DSCP value always being set to 0.
Commit 90427ef5d2a4 ("ipv6: fix flow labels when the traffic class
is non-0") caused the regression by masking out the flowlabel
which exposed the incorrect handling of the DSCP portion of the
flowlabel in ip6\_tunnel and ip6\_gre.

tag are validated correctly.

- don't use skb\_header\_pointer() to read the transport header, since
icmp\_socket\_deliver() already puts these 8 bytes in the linear area.

tcp: avoid fastopen API to be used on AF\_UNSPEC
[ Upstream commit ba615f675281d76fd19aa03558777f81fb6b6084 ]
Fastopen API should be used to perform fastopen operations on the TCP
socket. It does not make sense to use fastopen API to perform disconnect
by calling it with AF\_UNSPEC. The fastopen data path is also prone to
race conditions and bugs when using with AF\_UNSPEC.
One issue reported and analyzed by Vegard Nossum is as follows:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Thread A: Thread B:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
sendto()
- tcp\_sendmsg()
- sk\_stream\_memory\_free() = 0
- goto wait\_for\_sndbuf
- sk\_stream\_wait\_memory()
- sk\_wait\_event() // sleep

| - tcp\_sendmsg()
| - tcp\_sendmsg\_fastopen()
| - \_\_inet\_stream\_connect()
| - tcp\_disconnect() //because of AF\_UNSPEC
| - tcp\_transmit\_skb()// send RST
| - return 0; // no reconnect!
| - sk\_stream\_wait\_connect()
| - sock\_error()
| - xchg(&sk->sk\_err, 0)
| - return -ECONNRESET
- ... // wake up, see sk->sk\_err == 0
- skb\_entail() on TCP\_CLOSE socket
If the connection is reopened then we will send a brand new SYN packet
after thread A has already queued a buffer. At this point I think the
socket internal state (sequence numbers etc.) becomes messed up.
When the new connection is closed, the FIN-ACK is rejected because the
sequence number is outside the window. The other side tries to
retransmit,
but \_\_tcp\_retransmit\_skb() calls tcp\_trim\_head() on an empty skb which
corrupts the skb data length and hits a BUG() in copy\_and\_csum\_bits().
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Hence, this patch adds a check for AF\_UNSPEC in the fastopen data path
and return EOPNOTSUPP to user if such case happens.

vlan: Fix tcp checksum offloads in Q-in-Q vlans
[ Upstream commit 35d2f80b07bbe03fb358afb0bdeff7437a7d67ff ]
It appears that TCP checksum offloading has been broken for
Q-in-Q vlans. The behavior was execerbated by the
series
commit afb0bc972b52 ("Merge branch 'stacked\_vlan\_tso'")
that that enabled accleleration features on stacked vlans.
However, event without that series, it is possible to trigger
this issue. It just requires a lot more specialized configuration.
The root cause is the interaction between how
netdev\_intersect\_features() works, the features actually set on
the vlan devices and HW having the ability to run checksum with
longer headers.
The issue starts when netdev\_interesect\_features() replaces
NETIF\_F\_HW\_CSUM with a combination of NETIF\_F\_IP\_CSUM | NETIF\_F\_IPV6\_CSUM,
if the HW advertises IP|IPV6 specific checksums. This happens
for tagged and multi-tagged packets. However, HW that enables
IP|IPV6 checksum offloading doesn't gurantee that packets with
arbitrarily long headers can be checksummed.
This patch disables IP|IPV6 checksums on the packet for multi-tagged
packets.

net/mlx5: Avoid using pending command interface slots
[ Upstream commit 73dd3a4839c1d27c36d4dcc92e1ff44225ecbeb7 ]
Currently when firmware command gets stuck or it takes long time to
complete, the driver command will get timeout and the command slot is
freed and can be used for new commands, and if the firmware receive new
command on the old busy slot its behavior is unexpected and this could
be harmful.
To fix this when the driver command gets timeout we return failure,
but we don't free the command slot and we wait for the firmware to
explicitly respond to that command.
Once all the entries are busy we will stop processing new firmware
commands.

bonding: fix accounting of active ports in 3ad
[ Upstream commit 751da2a69b7cc82d83dc310ed7606225f2d6e014 ]
As of 7bb11dc9f59d and 0622cab0341c, bond slaves in a 3ad bond are not
removed from the aggregator when they are down, and the active slave count
is NOT equal to number of ports in the aggregator, but rather the number
of ports in the aggregator that are still enabled. The sysfs spew for
bonding\_show\_ad\_num\_ports() has a comment that says "Show number of active
802.3ad ports.", but it's currently showing total number of ports, both
active and inactive. Remedy it by using the same logic introduced in
0622cab0341c in \_\_bond\_3ad\_get\_active\_agg\_info(), so sysfs, procfs and
netlink all report the number of active ports. Note that this means that
IFLA\_BOND\_AD\_INFO\_NUM\_PORTS really means NUM\_ACTIVE\_PORTS instead of
NUM\_PORTS, and thus perhaps should be renamed for clarity.
Lightly tested on a dual i40e lacp bond, simulating link downs with an ip
link set dev  down, was able to produce the state where I could
see both in the same aggregator, but a number of ports count of 1.

Andrey Konovalov and idaifish@gmail.com reported crashes caused by
one skb shared\_info being overwritten from \_\_ip6\_append\_data()
Andrey program lead to following state :

The skb\_copy\_and\_csum\_bits(skb\_prev, maxfraglen, data + transhdrlen,
fraggap, 0); is overwriting skb->head and skb\_shared\_info
Since we apparently detect this rare condition too late, move the
code earlier to even avoid allocating skb and risking crashes.

bridge: start hello\_timer when enabling KERNEL\_STP in br\_stp\_start
[ Upstream commit 6d18c732b95c0a9d35e9f978b4438bba15412284 ]
Since commit 76b91c32dd86 ("bridge: stp: when using userspace stp stop
kernel hello and hold timers"), bridge would not start hello\_timer if
stp\_enabled is not KERNEL\_STP when br\_dev\_open.
The problem is even if users set stp\_enabled with KERNEL\_STP later,
the timer will still not be started. It causes that KERNEL\_STP can
not really work. Users have to re-ifup the bridge to avoid this.
This patch is to fix it by starting br->hello\_timer when enabling
KERNEL\_STP in br\_stp\_start.
As an improvement, it's also to start hello\_timer again only when
br->stp\_enabled is KERNEL\_STP in br\_hello\_timer\_expired, there is
no reason to start the timer again when it's NO\_STP.

ipv6: Prevent overrun when parsing v6 header options
[ Upstream commit 2423496af35d94a87156b063ea5cedffc10a70a1 ]
The KASAN warning repoted below was discovered with a syzkaller
program. The reproducer is basically:
int s = socket(AF\_INET6, SOCK\_RAW, NEXTHDR\_HOP);
send(s, &one\_byte\_of\_data, 1, MSG\_MORE);
send(s, &more\_than\_mtu\_bytes\_data, 2000, 0);
The socket() call sets the nexthdr field of the v6 header to
NEXTHDR\_HOP, the first send call primes the payload with a non zero
byte of data, and the second send call triggers the fragmentation path.
The fragmentation code tries to parse the header options in order
to figure out where to insert the fragment option. Since nexthdr points
to an invalid option, the calculation of the size of the network header
can made to be much larger than the linear section of the skb and data
is read outside of it.
This fix makes ip6\_find\_1stfrag return an error if it detects
running out-of-bounds.

net: Improve handling of failures on link and route dumps
[ Upstream commit f6c5775ff0bfa62b072face6bf1d40f659f194b2 ]
In general, rtnetlink dumps do not anticipate failure to dump a single
object (e.g., link or route) on a single pass. As both route and link
objects have grown via more attributes, that is no longer a given.
netlink dumps can handle a failure if the dump function returns an
error; specifically, netlink\_dump adds the return code to the response
if it is <= 0 so userspace is notified of the failure. The missing
piece is the rtnetlink dump functions returning the error.
Fix route and link dump functions to return the errors if no object is
added to an skb (detected by skb->len != 0). IPv6 route dumps
(rt6\_dump\_route) already return the error; this patch updates IPv4 and
link dumps. Other dump functions may need to be ajusted as well.

[ Upstream commit 263eec9b2a82e8697d064709414914b5b10ac538 ]
Currently, SMC enables remote access to physical memory when a user
has successfully configured and established an SMC-connection until ten
minutes after the last SMC connection is closed. Because this is considered
a security risk, drivers are supposed to use IB\_PD\_UNSAFE\_GLOBAL\_RKEY in
such a case.
This patch changes the current SMC code to use IB\_PD\_UNSAFE\_GLOBAL\_RKEY.
This improves user awareness, but does not remove the security risk itself.

tcp: eliminate negative reordering in tcp\_clean\_rtx\_queue
[ Upstream commit bafbb9c73241760023d8981191ddd30bb1c6dbac ]
tcp\_ack() can call tcp\_fragment() which may dededuct the
value tp->fackets\_out when MSS changes. When prior\_fackets

Note that tcp\_update\_reordering indeeds sets tp->reordering
to min(sysctl\_tcp\_max\_reordering, metric), but because
the comparison is signed, a negative metric always wins.

sctp: fix src address selection if using secondary addresses for ipv6
[ Upstream commit dbc2b5e9a09e9a6664679a667ff81cff6e5f2641 ]
Commit 0ca50d12fe46 ("sctp: fix src address selection if using secondary
addresses") has fixed a src address selection issue when using secondary
addresses for ipv4.
Now sctp ipv6 also has the similar issue. When using a secondary address,
sctp\_v6\_get\_dst tries to choose the saddr which has the most same bits
with the daddr by sctp\_v6\_addr\_match\_len. It may make some cases not work
as expected.
hostA:
[1] fd21:356b:459a:cf10::11 (eth1)
[2] fd21:356b:459a:cf20::11 (eth2)
hostB:
[a] fd21:356b:459a:cf30::2 (eth1)
[b] fd21:356b:459a:cf40::2 (eth2)
route from hostA to hostB:
fd21:356b:459a:cf30::/64 dev eth1 metric 1024 mtu 1500
The expected path should be:
fd21:356b:459a:cf10::11 <-> fd21:356b:459a:cf30::2
But addr[2] matches addr[a] more bits than addr[1] does, according to
sctp\_v6\_addr\_match\_len. It causes the path to be:
fd21:356b:459a:cf20::11 <-> fd21:356b:459a:cf30::2
This patch is to fix it with the same way as Marcelo's fix for sctp ipv4.
As no ip\_dev\_find for ipv6, this patch is to use ipv6\_chk\_addr to check
if the saddr is in a dev instead.
Note that for backwards compatibility, it will still do the addr\_match\_len
check here when no optimal is found.

tipc: make macro tipc\_wait\_for\_cond() smp safe
[ Upstream commit 844cf763fba654436d3a4279b6a672c196cf1901 ]
The macro tipc\_wait\_for\_cond() is embedding the macro sk\_wait\_event()
to fulfil its task. The latter, in turn, is evaluating the stated
condition outside the socket lock context. This is problematic if
the condition is accessing non-trivial data structures which may be
altered by incoming interrupts, as is the case with the cong\_links()
linked list, used by socket to keep track of the current set of
congested links. We sometimes see crashes when this list is accessed
by a condition function at the same time as a SOCK\_WAKEUP interrupt
is removing an element from the list.
We fix this by expanding selected parts of sk\_wait\_event() into the
outer macro, while ensuring that all evaluations of a given condition
are performed under socket lock protection.

tcp: avoid fragmenting peculiar skbs in SACK
[ Upstream commit b451e5d24ba6687c6f0e7319c727a709a1846c06 ]
This patch fixes a bug in splitting an SKB during SACK
processing. Specifically if an skb contains multiple
packets and is only partially sacked in the higher sequences,
tcp\_match\_sack\_to\_skb() splits the skb and marks the second fragment
as SACKed.
The current code further attempts rounding up the first fragment
to MSS boundaries. But it misses a boundary condition when the
rounded-up fragment size (pkt\_len) is exactly skb size. Spliting
such an skb is pointless and causses a kernel warning and aborts
the SACK processing. This patch universally checks such over-split
before calling tcp\_fragment to prevent these unnecessary warnings.

bpf, arm64: fix faulty emission of map access in tail calls
[ Upstream commit d8b54110ee944de522ccd3531191f39986ec20f9 ]
Shubham was recently asking on netdev why in arm64 JIT we don't multiply
the index for accessing the tail call map by 8. That led me into testing
out arm64 JIT wrt tail calls and it turned out I got a NULL pointer
dereference on the tail call.
The buggy access is at:
prog = array->ptrs[index];
if (prog == NULL)
goto out;
[...]
00000060: d2800e0a mov x10, #0x70 // #112
00000064: f86a682a ldr x10, [x1,x10]
00000068: f862694b ldr x11, [x10,x2]
0000006c: b40000ab cbz x11, 0x00000080
[...]
The code triggering the crash is f862694b. x1 at the time contains the
address of the bpf array, x10 offsetof(struct bpf\_array, ptrs). Meaning,
above we load the pointer to the program at map slot 0 into x10. x10
can then be NULL if the slot is not occupied, which we later on try to
access with a user given offset in x2 that is the map index.
Fix this by emitting the following instead:
[...]
00000060: d2800e0a mov x10, #0x70 // #112
00000064: 8b0a002a add x10, x1, x10
00000068: d37df04b lsl x11, x2, #3
0000006c: f86b694b ldr x11, [x10,x11]
00000070: b40000ab cbz x11, 0x00000084
[...]
This basically adds the offset to ptrs to the base address of the bpf
array we got and we later on access the map with an index \* 8 offset
relative to that. The tail call map itself is basically one large area
with meta data at the head followed by the array of prog pointers.
This makes tail calls working again, tested on Cavium ThunderX ARMv8.

s390/qeth: unbreak OSM and OSN support
[ Upstream commit 2d2ebb3ed0c6acfb014f98e427298673a5d07b82 ]
commit b4d72c08b358 ("qeth: bridgeport support - basic control")
broke the support for OSM and OSN devices as follows:
As OSM and OSN are L2 only, qeth\_core\_probe\_device() does an early
setup by loading the l2 discipline and calling qeth\_l2\_probe\_device().
In this context, adding the l2-specific bridgeport sysfs attributes
via qeth\_l2\_create\_device\_attributes() hits a BUG\_ON in fs/sysfs/group.c,
since the basic sysfs infrastructure for the device hasn't been
established yet.
Note that OSN actually has its own unique sysfs attributes
(qeth\_osn\_devtype), so the additional attributes shouldn't be created
at all.
For OSM, add a new qeth\_l2\_devtype that contains all the common
and l2-specific sysfs attributes.
When qeth\_core\_probe\_device() does early setup for OSM or OSN, assign
the corresponding devtype so that the ccwgroup probe code creates the
full set of sysfs attributes.
This allows us to skip qeth\_l2\_create\_device\_attributes() in case
of an early setup.
Any device that can't do early setup will initially have only the
generic sysfs attributes, and when it's probed later
qeth\_l2\_probe\_device() adds the l2-specific attributes.
If an early-setup device is removed (by calling ccwgroup\_ungroup()),
device\_unregister() will - using the devtype - delete the
l2-specific attributes before qeth\_l2\_remove\_device() is called.
So make sure to not remove them twice.
What complicates the issue is that qeth\_l2\_probe\_device() and
qeth\_l2\_remove\_device() is also called on a device when its
layer2 attribute changes (ie. its layer mode is switched).
For early-setup devices this wouldn't work properly - we wouldn't
remove the l2-specific attributes when switching to L3.
But switching the layer mode doesn't actually make any sense;
we already decided that the device can only operate in L2!
So just refuse to switch the layer mode on such devices. Note that
OSN doesn't have a layer2 attribute, so we only need to special-case
OSM.
Based on an initial patch by Ursula Braun.

driver: vrf: Fix one possible use-after-free issue
[ Upstream commit 1a4a5bf52a4adb477adb075e5afce925824ad132 ]
The current codes only deal with the case that the skb is dropped, it
may meet one use-after-free issue when NF\_HOOK returns 0 that means
the skb is stolen by one netfilter rule or hook.
When one netfilter rule or hook stoles the skb and return NF\_STOLEN,
it means the skb is taken by the rule, and other modules should not
touch this skb ever. Maybe the skb is queued or freed directly by the
rule.
Now uses the nf\_hook instead of NF\_HOOK to get the result of netfilter,
and check the return value of nf\_hook. Only when its value equals 1, it
means the skb could go ahead. Or reset the skb as NULL.
BTW, because vrf\_rcv\_finish is empty function, so needn't invoke it
even though nf\_hook returns 1. But we need to modify vrf\_rcv\_finish
to deal with the NF\_STOLEN case.
There are two cases when skb is stolen.
1. The skb is stolen and freed directly.
There is nothing we need to do, and vrf\_rcv\_finish isn't invoked.
2. The skb is queued and reinjected again.
The vrf\_rcv\_finish would be invoked as okfn, so need to free the
skb in it.
