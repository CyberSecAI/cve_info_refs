{
  "CVE-2017-18221": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the memory locking implementation in the Linux kernel. When a page is unmapped, the NR_MLOCK counter was not always decremented, causing the counter to grow permanently.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition in the `__munlock_pagevec()` function when decrementing the `NR_MLOCK` counter during a page unmap operation, resulting in incorrect memory locking accounting.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service by disrupting the memory locking accounting, leading to a resource exhaustion or other system instability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker execution of an application that calls mlockall and munlockall repeatedly in a specific pattern to trigger the race condition.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access is required to trigger the race condition via system calls."
  }
