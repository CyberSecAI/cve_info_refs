{
  "CVE-2017-18273": {
    "description": "Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in ImageMagick, an image manipulation program, that allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via CPU exhaustion (infinite loop) or heap-based buffer overreads with a crafted image file.",
    "root_cause": "Malformed image files causing an infinite loop in `GetImageIndexInList`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "CPU exhaustion (infinite loop)",
       "Heap-based buffer overreads"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted image file, leading to CPU exhaustion or heap-based buffer overreads, which may potentially result in the execution of arbitrary code.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted image file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user or an automated system using ImageMagick into opening the specially crafted image."
