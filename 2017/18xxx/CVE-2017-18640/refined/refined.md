{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The alias feature in SnakeYAML allows entity expansion during a load operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "YAML Entity Expansion vulnerability due to the alias feature."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious payload can cause a denial of service (DoS) attack by triggering a heap overflow.",
     "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted YAML document with recursively defined aliases, an attacker can force the SnakeYAML parser to allocate large amounts of memory, leading to a DoS.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application with a malicious YAML document containing a \"billion laughs\" attack pattern using aliases."
  },
  "affected_component": "snakeyaml",
  "fixed_version": "1.26",
   "details": "The vulnerability is related to the way SnakeYAML handles aliases, which can be exploited to create a \"billion laughs\" attack pattern. By recursively referencing aliases, an attacker can cause the parser to enter an infinite loop of memory allocation, leading to a DoS. The fix involves introducing a configuration option to disable alias expansion or define the maximum depth of alias resolution. Versions prior to 1.26 are vulnerable and the vulnerability is remotely exploitable."
