The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a command injection vulnerability. While the advisory does not reference CVE-2017-18802 directly, it discusses a command injection vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router models and includes a CVSS score that indicates the severity of the reported issue.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the firmware of the affected NETGEAR routers. The specific vulnerable code or functionality is not detailed in this advisory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete compromise of the device: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could grant the attacker full control over the affected device.
- Data breach: Attackers could potentially access sensitive information stored on the device.
- Denial of service: Malicious commands could cause the device to malfunction or become unresponsive.
- Further attacks: Compromised devices can be used as a launching point for further attacks against other devices on the network or on the internet.

**Attack vectors:**
- The advisory mentions that the attack vector is "local" (AV:L). The attack vector appears to be local access to the device's web interface or configuration via an existing admin account on the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the device's administration interface (PR:H), and there is no user interaction required (UI:N) to trigger the vulnerability. 
- This may involve having an existing account with administrative privileges on the targeted router.

**Affected Devices:**
The advisory lists the following affected product models and firmware versions:
* R6100 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.14
* R7500 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.110
* R7500v2 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.16
* R7800 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.32
* EX6200v2 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.50
* D7800 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.22

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory provides a CVSS v3 score of 6.7 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- The advisory recommends upgrading to the latest firmware to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The advisory acknowledges Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave for reporting the vulnerability.
