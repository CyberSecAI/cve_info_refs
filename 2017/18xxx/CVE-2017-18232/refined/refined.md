    "info": "The provided content contains information about CVE-2017-18232. Here's a summary:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nA race condition exists in the Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) implementation within the Linux kernel related to mutex handling in libsas. Specifically, the issue arises between probing and destroying a port.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the mishandling of a mutex within the libsas component of the Linux kernel's SAS subsystem, leading to a potential deadlock.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nExploitation of this vulnerability can cause a denial of service (DoS) through a kernel deadlock, making the system unresponsive.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nA local attacker with physical access to the system is required to trigger specific error-handling code to cause the deadlock\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\nThe attacker must have local, physical access to the system and the ability to trigger specific error conditions in the SAS subsystem. The attacker does not require special privileges on the machine itself."
