## FAQ

### Why I don’t see all users on the report page, just certain of them?

It is necessary to select user roles, that will be able to see Timesheet page for completing the schedule. To do so, please go to the plugin settings page and find “Display” settings. After that, select the necessary roles and save changes.

### How can I add a status?

You can do it using “Statuses” option on the plugin settings page.

### Is it possible to delete the status from the statuses list?

You can’t delete the status, but you can hide it. Please go to the plugin settings page, find the table with statuses, and deselect the status you want to hide.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

Lack of documentation. Not clear how to use it.

Sure, the user interface looks nice. But this plugin lacks the most basic of functions to be actually useful as there are:
– a way to export to CSV
– A way to change the default settings for the sheet (Logging what you’ve done the previous week or month and not just the next 10 days)
– A way to lock users out of the report screen. It’s none of their business
– A way to limit the usage to certain roles or users.
– A way to remove or rename a status
– A way to change the resolution. In the free version it’s an hour, in the PRO (oh well) version it’s 5 minutes. What I would need is 30 min.
Al in all 30 dollars is way overpriced for what the pro version delivers.
The free version for now only shows posibilities and missed chances.
All that said and done, and as I hope for future developments on this plugin, I’ve written my own export to CSV plugin as I needed some custom output anyhow.
To support this plugin I have a Dutch translation available. If you would let me know where I can send it, it’s all yours to include.

OK, so had to change my 5\* rating because although it showed promise the fact is it doesn’t fulfill its objectives at this stage of its development (see my Support posts). It is not clear when the bugs will be fixed.
Originally I wrote (giving it 5\*): “I’m going to kick this off…
For my particular purpose this is very handy. It is well constructed but most importantly it is very quick and easy to select the times one worked, identify the tasks and the reports are well laid out.
I hope more people will download it and find it useful and that development will continue.”
