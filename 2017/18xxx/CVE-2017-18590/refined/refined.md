The provided content is a description of the "Timesheet" plugin for WordPress. While it contains a changelog, it does not describe any specific vulnerabilities.

Specifically, it mentions "Bugfix : Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was fixed" in version 0.1.5, released on 17.04.2017.  Since the CVE is for 2017-18590, and this was released before the publication date, it's plausible this could be related. However, the description is vague and does not describe the vulnerability itself.

Therefore:
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSS vulnerabilities
- **Impact of exploitation**: Not detailed, but XSS allows for arbitrary script execution within a user's browser in the context of the vulnerable web application.
- **Attack vectors**: Not specified
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Not specified. Likely requires ability to inject malicious script into a field, or manipulate an input that isn't properly sanitized.

The information is still vague and more detail would be needed to verify this is the relevant fix for CVE-2017-18590.
