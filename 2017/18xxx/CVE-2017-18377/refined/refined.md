The provided content does not include information about CVE-2017-18377. However, it details multiple vulnerabilities found in Wireless IP Cameras, specifically:

**1. CVE-2017-8224 - Backdoor account:**
    - **Root Cause:** A hardcoded root account with known credentials exists on the camera.
    - **Weakness:** Backdoor account with default credentials.
    - **Impact:**  Allows unauthorized access to the camera with root privileges.
    - **Attack Vector:**  Telnet on the camera's IP address.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network connectivity to the camera.

**2. CVE-2017-8222 - RSA key and certificates:**
    - **Root Cause:** The camera contains an embedded Apple certificate with a private RSA key.
    - **Weakness:** Inclusion of private key in the filesystem.
    - **Impact:** Potential misuse of the key for malicious purposes.
    - **Attack Vector:** Access to the camera's filesystem.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Root access on the camera

**3. CVE-2017-8225 - Pre-Auth Info Leak (credentials) within the custom HTTP server:**
    - **Root Cause:** The custom HTTP server, based on GoAhead, does not properly check authentication for access to `.ini` files containing credentials.
    - **Weakness:** Insecure access control mechanism.
    - **Impact:**  Allows attackers to retrieve sensitive information like credentials, FTP accounts, and SMTP accounts.
    - **Attack Vector:** HTTP requests to the camera with empty `loginuse` and `loginpas` parameters.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network connectivity to the camera.

**4. Authenticated RCE as root:**
    - **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability in the `set_ftp.cgi` script.
    - **Weakness:** Insecure input validation in a CGI script.
    - **Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary commands as root.
    - **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `set_ftp.cgi` script.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Valid admin credentials and network connectivity to the camera.

**5. Pre-Auth RCE as root:**
    - **Root Cause:**  Combination of the pre-auth info leak and the authenticated RCE.
    - **Weakness:** Exploitable vulnerability chain.
    - **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root without any prior authentication
    - **Attack Vector:** A combination of HTTP requests exploiting both vulnerabilities.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network connectivity to the camera.

**6. CVE-2017-8223 - Misc - Streaming without authentication:**
   - **Root Cause:** The RTSP server doesn't require authentication.
   - **Weakness:** Lack of authentication for streaming.
    - **Impact:**  Allows unauthorized access to the camera's video stream.
    - **Attack Vector:** Connection to the RTSP port.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Network connectivity to the camera.

**7. CVE-2017-8221 - Misc - "Cloud" (Aka Botnet):**
    - **Root Cause:** Weak "cloud" protocol that establishes UDP tunnels using only the camera's serial number and transmits credentials in clear text.
    - **Weakness:** Insecure P2P protocol.
    - **Impact:**  Allows unauthorized access to the camera, and could allow attackers to bruteforce credentials of cameras behind NAT, potentially leading to control and misuse.
    - **Attack Vector:** Interception or manipulation of the clear-text UDP traffic and sending crafted requests to the camera.
    - **Required Capabilities:** Knowledge of camera serial number and network connectivity to the cloud server.
