    "root_cause": "The `open_envvar` function in `xdg-open` uses `printf` with an unsanitized user-controlled `$BROWSER` environment variable and a user-supplied URL.

This could potentially lead to various malicious activities, such as redirecting browser traffic through a proxy server by injecting `--proxy-pac-url` or other command line options.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when `xdg-open` is called with a crafted URL, and the `$BROWSER` environment variable contains `%s`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the `$BROWSER` environment variable and provide a crafted URL. The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `xdg-open` command execution on the target system."
