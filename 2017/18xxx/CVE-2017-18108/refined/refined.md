- **Root cause of vulnerability:** JNDI injection vulnerability in the administration SMTP configuration resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in the SMTP configuration, allowing for JNDI injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers with administration rights can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious JNDI lookups into the SMTP configuration, an attacker could force the server to execute arbitrary code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administration rights to modify the SMTP configuration.
