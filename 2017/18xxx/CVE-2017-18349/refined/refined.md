Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-18349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of an outdated version of the `fastjson` library (version 1.2.24 and prior) which contains a remote code execution vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs during the deserialization of a JSON string into a Java object. Specifically, it's related to the `@type` property, which when present in the input JSON, can be exploited to instantiate and execute arbitrary classes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe deserialization: The `fastjson` library, when parsing a JSON string, does not properly validate the provided `@type` property, allowing an attacker to specify a class to be instantiated.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By crafting a malicious JSON payload with a specific class (`JdbcRowSetImpl` in this case) and a pointer to a remote RMI service that serves a malicious object, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation can allow a remote attacker to gain full control of the server on which the vulnerable `fastjson` library is being used.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The attacker can execute any system command on the targeted machine (e.g., `calc.exe` as demonstrated).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious JSON Payload: The attack vector is a specially crafted JSON string that exploits the vulnerable deserialization function.
- RMI Service: An attacker needs to set up a remote RMI service that hosts a malicious java class (Exploit.class) that will be loaded to execute the code.
- HTTP POST Request: The attacker sends the malicious JSON payload in the body of an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable application, triggering the vulnerable deserialization in Fastjson.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- Control over RMI service: The attacker must be able to set up and control a malicious RMI service.
- Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint: The attacker must know or find the specific endpoint in the application that processes JSON using the vulnerable `fastjson` library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a JSON string containing the `@type` property, which the `fastjson` library uses to deserialize the object. In this case, the attacker exploits this functionality using `JdbcRowSetImpl` class, and a RMI service to load and execute a malicious class.
- The provided github issue clearly demonstrates the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including setting up an RMI service, creating a malicious java class, and sending a malicious JSON payload.
- The issue also states the fix would be to upgrade the `fastjson` version to 1.2.45 or later.

This issue highlights a critical vulnerability present in older versions of the `fastjson` library and provides a detailed view of how it can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.
