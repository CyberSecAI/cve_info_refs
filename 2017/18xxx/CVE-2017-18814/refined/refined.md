The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in some ReadyNAS devices. Although the advisory states "Associated CVE IDs: None.", based on the advisory date and vulnerable product list, it is highly likely to be related to CVE-2017-18814.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the device, likely within user-controlled data or settings. When other users access the affected part of the application, the stored malicious script is executed in their browsers.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the ReadyNAS device. When a user views the data containing the script, the browser will execute the attacker's script. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
    *   Defacement of the user interface.
    *   Phishing attacks.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Potentially other malicious activities depending on the capabilities of the vulnerable web interface.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface of the ReadyNAS device, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious JavaScript or HTML to be stored.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject and store the malicious script on the ReadyNAS device. The attacker would likely require some authenticated access or would need to find a vulnerable interface that allows storing data. The CVSS vector suggests a local attack vector with high privileges. A user with lower privileges might be able to inject the malicious code through the management interface. User interaction is required for the malicious script to be executed on the admin's browser.

The advisory indicates that all ReadyNAS OS 6 devices running versions prior to 6.8.0 are affected. NETGEAR recommends users update to the latest firmware to patch this vulnerability.
