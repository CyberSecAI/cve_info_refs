**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow that occurs before authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the affected routers.
- The vulnerability can be exploited pre-authentication, meaning no login is required.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the device, indicated by the CVSS v3 score of 8.8 which includes high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning that the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Models:**
- D6200 (firmware prior to 1.1.00.24)
- R6700v2 (firmware prior to 1.1.0.42)
- R6800 (firmware prior to 1.1.0.42)
- R6900v2 (firmware prior to 1.1.0.42)

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory includes a CVSS v3 vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` which gives further details into the attack requirements (Adjacent network, low complexity, no privileges and no user interaction).
- The advisory strongly recommends users to update their firmware to the latest version.
- The document mentions that the vulnerability remains if the recommended steps are not followed and that NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences due to inaction.
- The advisory was initially published on 2017-11-22 and updated on 2017-12-31 to include the D6200 model.
