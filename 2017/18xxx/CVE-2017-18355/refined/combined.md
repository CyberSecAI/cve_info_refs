### @a335926a **[a335926a](/a335926a)** commented [Aug 30, 2017](#issue-253907500)

This PR fixes a few issues listed below:

* changes errors to be more generic, removing extraneous information to user
* adds validation for urls to only originate from 'http' or 'https' protocols
* sorts requires by alphabetical (node, node\_modules, project) order
* only exposes `/_ah/stop` if `NODE_ENV` is set to `development`
* only exposes `progress-bar.html` used in application

Sorry, something went wrong.
