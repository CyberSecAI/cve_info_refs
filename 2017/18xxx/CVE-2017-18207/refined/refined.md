Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-18207 and CVE-2016-5636:

**CVE-2017-18207**

*   **Root Cause:** The `Wave_read._read_fmt_chunk` function in the Python `wave` module does not ensure a non-zero value for the number of audio channels. This can result in a division-by-zero error when attempting to calculate sample sizes during audio file processing.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Lack of input validation to ensure the number of audio channels is not zero.
    *   Division by zero, leading to an uncaught exception.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS). A specially crafted WAV file with a zero channel value can crash a Python application by triggering an unhandled division-by-zero error.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   By providing a malicious WAV file that causes the function to divide by zero during file format reading.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to provide the Python application with a malicious WAV file.

**CVE-2016-5636**

*   **Root Cause:** An integer overflow in the `get_data` function within `zipimport.c` (part of the Python zipimport module) occurs when a negative data size value is provided.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by a negative data size value provided to `get_data` function.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  Unspecified impact, potentially including remote code execution, due to the heap-based buffer overflow. The CVE description notes the impact as "unspecified".
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  By crafting a malicious ZIP archive that leads to a negative data size value being used in the `get_data` function.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to get the Python interpreter to process a crafted ZIP archive.
