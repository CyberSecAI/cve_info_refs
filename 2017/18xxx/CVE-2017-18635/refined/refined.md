  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The noVNC client was using `innerHTML` to display status messages, allowing a malicious VNC server to inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript, into the noVNC web page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper handling of server-supplied data in the client-side application"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:\n  - Stealing session cookies or tokens\n  - Performing actions on behalf of the user\n  - Defacing the page\n  - Redirecting the user to a malicious site",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious VNC server injects malicious HTML into status messages.",
      "The victim visits a webpage with a vulnerable noVNC client that connects to the malicious server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to set up a malicious VNC server that is reachable by the vulnerable noVNC client. They also need a way to convince the victim to open the vulnerable noVNC client.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the `vnc_auto.html`, `vnc.html`, and any users of the `include/ui.js` files. The fix involves replacing `innerHTML` with `textContent` in these files to prevent the execution of injected scripts. The exploit can be triggered by a malicious VNC server injecting the payload via the `server-name` parameter during initial connection."
