Based on the provided information, this commit addresses an information leak vulnerability in the `aacraid` driver. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

- The `aac_send_raw_srb()` and `aac_get_hba_info()` functions in the `aacraid` driver were copying stack-allocated structures (`struct aac_srb_reply` and `struct aac_hba_info`, respectively) to userspace without properly initializing all their members.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leak:** Uninitialized stack memory could contain sensitive data from previous operations, potentially leaking kernel information to userspace.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive kernel memory contents by triggering the vulnerable ioctl calls and examining the uninitialized portions of the copied structures. This could lead to various forms of information disclosure, potentially aiding further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered via specific ioctl calls (`aac_send_raw_srb` and `aac_get_hba_info`) targeting the `aacraid` driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the `aacraid` driver via ioctl calls, which typically requires some level of access to the device or its driver interface. The attacker needs to be a local user with necessary privileges to interact with the driver.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves using `memset()` to zero out the structures before copying them to userspace. This ensures no uninitialized stack data is leaked.
- The commit message explicitly mentions that the vulnerability is caused by copying stack allocated structs without initializing all members to userspace.
- The "Fixes" lines point to the commits which introduced the vulnerable code.
