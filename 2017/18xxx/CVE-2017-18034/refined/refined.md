Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18034:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of repository branch names when displaying deleted files within the source browser resource of Atlassian FishEye and Crucible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS flaw. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode or sanitize branch names, allowing injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the victim's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By injecting malicious scripts, attackers could potentially steal session cookies, impersonating legitimate users.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal or modify data displayed in the application.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** They could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Website Defacement:** They could alter the look and feel of the application for the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Branch Name:** The attack vector is a specially crafted repository branch name that contains malicious HTML or JavaScript.
*   **Source Browser Resource:** The vulnerability is triggered when the source browser resource attempts to display deleted files of the affected branch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access to Indexed Repository:** Attackers need to have write access to an indexed repository that is being monitored by FishEye or Crucible. This allows them to create the malicious branch name.
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of Atlassian FishEye and Crucible prior to 4.5.1 and 4.6.0.
*   The issue is labeled with `cvss-medium` which indicates that it has a medium severity.
*   The issue is fixed in versions 4.5.1 and later, as well as 4.6.0 and later.
*   The vulnerability is related to both FishEye (FE-6994) and Crucible (CRUC-8161) projects within Atlassian.
