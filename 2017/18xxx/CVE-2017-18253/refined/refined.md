The content is related to CVE-2017-18253.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A null pointer dereference in the `LoadOpenCLDevices` function of ImageMagick. The `AcquireQuantumMemory` function may return NULL, which is then used in subsequent operations on `device->platform_name`, causing a null pointer dereference if the allocation fails.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code lacks proper error handling when `AcquireQuantumMemory` returns NULL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A crash due to a null pointer dereference, leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing an input that triggers the call to `LoadOpenCLDevices` and causes `AcquireQuantumMemory` to fail, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply an input to ImageMagick that causes the `LoadOpenCLDevices` function to be called, where the memory allocation fails.
