The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Dolibarr, but **does not match the CVE ID CVE-2017-18260**. The content is related to **CVE-2017-9839**.

**CVE-2017-9839 Details (From the Content):**

*   **Root Cause:** The Dolibarr application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization. URL encoding can be used to bypass existing filters.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in various parts of the application.
    *   The application's filter mechanism can be bypassed using URL encoding.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code.
    *   Successful exploitation could lead to data exfiltration, database manipulation, and potentially complete server compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP requests with specially crafted parameters are used to inject SQL code.
    *   Vulnerable parameters include `viewstatut`, `type`, and `propal_statut` (renamed to `search_statut` in later versions).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be authenticated to the Dolibarr application.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's web interface.
    *   Knowledge of SQL syntax is required to craft malicious payloads.

**Specific Vulnerable Parameters:**

*   `/htdocs/product/stats/card.php #type`
    *   URL: `/dolibarr/htdocs/product/stats/card.php?id=all&leftmenu=stats&type=[SQL STATEMENT HERE]`
*   `/htdocs/comm/propal/list.php #propal_statut`
    *   POST request with `propal_statut` parameter containing SQL injection payload. This parameter was renamed to `search_statut` in later versions, and remains vulnerable.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was partially fixed in Dolibarr version 5.0.4, but the `viewstatut` parameter remained vulnerable even in version 7.0.0. Also the `propal_statut`, renamed to `search_statut` remains vulnerable in version 7.0.0.
*   The vulnerability can be automated with tools like SQLmap using a "charencode" tamper script.
*   The report includes screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability using a single quote character and `SLEEP()` commands to induce delays.
