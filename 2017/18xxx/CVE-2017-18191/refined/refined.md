  "CVE-2017-18191": {
    "Description": "openstack-nova: Swapping encrypted volumes can allow an attacker to corrupt the LUKS header causing a denial of service in the host",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenStack Nova handles encrypted volumes during volume swapping. When swapping encrypted volumes, the system does not properly attach an encryptor to the target volume. As a result, the raw, underlying volume is exposed, and data is copied to it without encryption. This leaves the LUKS header vulnerable to corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate encryption handling during volume swapping.",
      "Exposure of raw underlying volume data.",
      "Failure to identify and handle LUKS-encrypted volumes properly.",
      "Vulnerable LUKS header due to a lack of proper encryption handling."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can corrupt the LUKS header of the encrypted volume, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the compute host. This occurs because when an encrypted volume is swapped, the decrypted data from the original volume is written directly to the raw target volume, without attaching the necessary encryptors. When the instance tries to reattach to the volume, the system reformats it, causing data loss or if the header is corrupted, the host becomes inaccessible.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Detaching an encrypted volume from an instance.",
      "Reattaching an encrypted volume after swapping it with another volume via the `nova volume-update` command."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have the ability to swap volumes on an instance. This ability allows them to access and corrupt the underlying raw volume before detaching and reattaching it."
