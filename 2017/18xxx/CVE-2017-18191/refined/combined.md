## Topic

An update for openstack-nova is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and controlling access through users and projects.

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-nova: Swapping encrypted volumes can allow an attacker to corrupt the LUKS header causing a denial of service in the host (CVE-2017-18191)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* This update fixes a race condition that could generate error messages and cause migration failures during nova live migrations.

Prior to this update, if a domain was already cleaned out by periodic tasks, undefining the domain source during a live migration sometimes generated a "Domain not found (Code=42)" error. (BZ#1614325)

# OSSA-2018-001: Raw underlying encrypted volume access[Â¶](#ossa-2018-001-raw-underlying-encrypted-volume-access "Link to this heading")

Date:

April 20, 2018

CVE:

CVE-2017-18191

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Nova: >=15.0.0 <=15.1.0, >=16.0.0 <=16.1.1

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

Lee Yarwood (Red Hat) reported a vulnerability in Nova encrypted volumes handling. By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume an attacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS header resuling in a denial of service attack on the compute host. All Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected.

## Patches[Â¶](#patches "Link to this heading")

* <https://review.openstack.org/561604> (Ocata)
* <https://review.openstack.org/543569> (Pike)
* <https://review.openstack.org/460243> (Queens)

## Credits[Â¶](#credits "Link to this heading")

=====================================================
OSSA-2018-001: Raw underlying encrypted volume access
=====================================================

:Date: April 20, 2018
:CVE: CVE-2017-18191

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Nova: >=15.0.0 <=15.1.0, >=16.0.0 <=16.1.1

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Lee Yarwood (Red Hat) reported a vulnerability in Nova encrypted
volumes handling. By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume an
attacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS
header resuling in a denial of service attack on the compute host. All
Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected.

### Bug Description

Description

===========

At present when swapping encrypted volumes no attempt is made to attach an encryptor to the target volume. This results in the RAW underlying volume being used during the rebase, where decrypted data is copied from the original volume to the target:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/76dfdfc1ad8c0e5376bd997e45f65bec9ff53d12/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L1338-L1372>

Any attempt to detach and then reattach this volume from the instance will lead to the volume being reformatted as the os-brick supplied encryptors do not identify the volume as encrypted:

<https://github.com/openstack/os-brick/blob/6835b885dc4144fdc6e9863ca59ae54f76938995/os_brick/encryptors/luks.py#L138-L161>

Additionally, while unlikely, a malicious user could easily DOS the compute node hosting the instance by writing a corrupt LUKS header to the RAW volume before detaching and reattaching the volume. For example, setting a keyslot iters (used by PBKDF2) to a large value etc (kudos to mdbooth for suggesting this):

<https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/LUKS-standard/on-disk-format.pdf>

This method of DOS'ing the compute host was previously discussed in the context of [bug 1724573](/bugs/1724573) but dismissed as access to the underlying volume was dependent on a host reboot, outside of a users control. This bug differs as a user has full control of the above volume-update/swap\_volume flow that provides access to the underlying volume.

Steps to reproduce

==================

- Create two encrypted volumes

$ cinder type-create LUKS

$ cinder encryption-type-create --cipher aes-xts-plain64 \

                                --key\_size 256 \

                                --control\_location front-end LUKS luks

$ cinder type-create LUKS\_NEW

$ cinder encryption-type-create --cipher aes-xts-plain64 \

                                --key\_size 256 \

                                --control\_location front-end LUKS\_NEW luks

$ cinder create --volume-type LUKS 1

$ cinder create --volume-type LUKS\_NEW 1

- Spawn an instance, attaching the first volume before swapping to the second:

$ nova boot --image cirros-0.3.5-x86\_64-disk --flavor 1 swap\_test

$ nova volume-attach $instance $vol-luks

$ nova volume-update $instance $vol-luks $vol-luks-new

- Review the resulting volume attachment on the compute host:

$ virsh domblklist $instance

Target Source

------------------------------------------------

vda /opt/stack/data/nova/instances/3d4c5842-45ab-4660-bf6e-9459f9a2ff8a/disk

vdb /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-36001405ba072cc9f93e444c9433ead1c

$ ll /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-36001405ba072cc9f93e444c9433ead1c

lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 9 Dec 21 05:30 /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-36001405ba072cc9f93e444c9433ead1c -> ../../sdd

$ sudo qemu-img info /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-36001405ba072cc9f93e444c9433ead1c

image: /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-36001405ba072cc9f93e444c9433ead1c

file format: raw

virtual size: 1.0G (1073741824 bytes)

disk size: 0

Expected result

===============

The encrypted volumes are rebased with their associated encryptors attached, leading to encrypted data being written to the underlying volumes.

Actual result

=============

Decrypted data from the source volume is written to the underlying target volume. This data will be lost with a subsequent detach / attach cycle. Access to the underlying volume could also be used by a malicious user to DOS the local compute host.

Environment

===========

1. Exact version of OpenStack you are running. See the following

  list for all releases: <http://docs.openstack.org/releases/>

2. Which hypervisor did you use?

   (For example: Libvirt + KVM, Libvirt + XEN, Hyper-V, PowerKVM, ...)

   What's the version of that?

Libvirt + KVM

2. Which storage type did you use?

   (For example: Ceph, LVM, GPFS, ...)

   What's the version of that?

LVM

3. Which networking type did you use?

   (For example: nova-network, Neutron with OpenVSwitch, ...)

I think the priority here is that the user loses their data. The DoS potential is real, but relatively inefficient. I think we could use a CVE to communicate the problem to users, but I don't think this particular issue is important enough to jump through secrecy hoops while we work on the data-loss bug.

I would personally be in favour of early disclosure, handling this openly, and getting it done quickly. We could possibly leave disclosure til early January, though, as we're unlikely to even start work on the fix until then. I'll obviously defer to the VMT and the reporter, just my 2c.

Agreed, the data loss bug is of much higher importance than the potential DoS, just wanted to ensure VMT members were at least aware of the possibility for this to be used maliciously. If there are no further concerns or objections then I'm fine with early disclosure so we can fix this as a priority, in the open.

Since this report concerns a possible security risk, an incomplete security advisory task has been added while the core security reviewers for the affected project or projects confirm the bug and discuss the scope of any vulnerability along with potential solutions.

This sounds similar to OSSA-2016-012, thus I this this is a class A according to VMT taxonomy ( <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy> ).

If this doesn't warrant an embargoed disclosure, or if a fix isn't proposed in timely manner, we should loop ossg-coresec before making this public, as explained in the embargo exception process here: <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#embargo-exceptions>

Given Matthew and Lee are both suggesting we switch to our public workflow in hope of getting the data loss problem solved in a more timely manner (at the expense of disclosing a somewhat inefficient DoS risk), I've gone ahead and subscribed ossg-coresec reviewers to get their input first.

Have these problems have existed since the introduction of LUKS support? Or did the ability to perform a volume-update/swap\_volume come later? Are all currently supported stable branches (let's say back to stable/ocata anyway since stable/newton is likely to finally get EOL'd by the time this is fixed) at risk from this?

Yes this has been an issue since the introduction of the LUKS encryptors and is present all the way back to stable/ocata (and stable/newton FWIW).

I know it's been holiday time for a lot of people, but given it's been two weeks at this point and we've got some consensus from the reporter and another core reviewer as well as some of the VMT, I'm going ahead and switching this one to our public workflow ending the embargo.

libvirt: Collocate encryptor and volume driver calls

This change introduces new utility methods for attaching and detaching

    frontend volume encryptors. These methods centralise the optional

    fetching of encryption metadata associated with a volume, fetching of the

    required encryptor and calls to detach or attach the encryptor.

These new utility methods are called either after initially connecting

    to or before disconnecting from a volume. This ensures encryptors are

    correctly connected when swapping volumes for example, where previously

    no attempt was made to attach an encryptor to the target volume.

The request context is provided to swap\_volume and various other config

    generation related methods to allow for the lookup of the relevant

    encryption metadata if it is not provided.

Closes-bug: #1739593

I wanted to give the master change sometime to bed in and while there are conflicts there don't appear to be any show stoppers AFAICT. I'll try to post something for review in the coming week so other stable cores can review.

Rather than backport these libvirt driver changes to stable branches, which are non-trivial refactors of the code, why can't we just put something in the stable branches that explicitly fails a swap volume of encrypted volumes? If swapping encrypted volumes doesn't work until queens, and only then if you're not using native luks encryption, it seems OK to just deny the operation outright in stable branches as a resolution to this bug for pike and ocata.

If swapping encrypted volumes is already unusable in stable, then I don't see any significant concerns with making it safely unusable. Sounds far less likely to introduce regressions in stable too.

So at this point I think we're just waiting for review of the stable/pike fix and then a similar fix backported to stable/ocata? Looks like we can probably get moving on CVE assignment from the VMT end in that case. Thanks!

CVE-2017-18191 is already reserved for this and can, I suppose, be included in that release note already. You're right that OSSA numbers have historically been assigned at the time of publication so I would consider either amending the release note later and not blocking the patch on it, or we can attempt to work out some sort of coordination mechanism for earlier OSSA assignment.

libvirt: Block swap volume attempts with encrypted volumes prior to Queens

Prior to Queens any attempt to swap between encrypted volumes would

    result in unencrypted data being written to the new volume. This

    unencrypted data would then be overwritten the next time the volume was

    encrypted, resulting in the volume being reformatted.

libvirt: Block swap volume attempts with encrypted volumes prior to Queens
Prior to Queens any attempt to swap between encrypted volumes would
result in unencrypted data being written to the new volume. This
unencrypted data would then be overwritten the next time the volume was
attached to an instance as Nova no longer identified the volume as
encrypted, resulting in the volume being reformatted.
This stable only change uses limited parts of the following changes to
block all swap\_volume attempts with encrypted volumes prior to Queens
where this was resolved by Ica323b87fa85a454fca9d46ada3677f18 and also
blocked when using QEMU to decrypt LUKS volumes by
Ibfa64f18bbd2fb70db7791330ed1a64fe61c1.
Ica323b87fa85a454fca9d46ada3677f18fe50022
The request context is provided to swap\_volume in order to look up the
encryption metadata of a volume.
Ibfa64f18bbd2fb70db7791330ed1a64fe61c1355
Attempts to swap from an encrypted volume are blocked with a
NotImplementedError exception raised.
I258127fdcd011ccec721d5ff62eb7f128f130336
Attempts to swap from an unencrypted volume to an encrypted volume are
also blocked with a NotImplementedError exception raised.
Ie02d298cd92d5b5ebcbbcd2b0e8be01f197bfafb
The serial of a volume is used as the id if connection\_info for the
volume doesn't contain the volume\_id key. Required to avoid bug #1746609.

Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info: he I/O latency of a cinder volume after live migration of an instance to which it's attached increases significantly. This stays increased till the VM is stopped and started again.  --- Additional comment from Kashyap Chamarthy on 2017-07-29 11:21:04 EDT ---  The patch for Git master is merged.  And here's the upstream stable/newton backport, in-progress:      <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/488959/>  --- Additional comment from Kashyap Chamarthy on 2017-09-18 09:37:30 EDT ---  Verification notes for this bug:  *Without* this bug fix (from openstack-nova-14.0.8-2.el7ost), when you  migrate a Nova instance with a Cinder volume -- where both Nova instance's disk and the Cinder volume are on Ceph -- the cache value for  the Cinder volume (erroneously) changes from 'writeback' to 'none':      [Check by doing `ps -ef | grep qemu`, and look for the relevant QEMU     process associated with the Nova instance.]      Pre-migration, QEMU command-line for the Nova instance:          [...] -drive file=rbd:volumes/volume-[...],cache=writeback      Post-migration, QEMU command-line for the Nova instance:          [...] -drive file=rbd:volumes/volume-[...],cache=none  *With* the bug fix (from openstack-nova-14.0.8-2.el7ost), the cache  value for the Cinder volume should remain 'writeback':      Pre-migration, QEMU command-line for the Nova instance:          [...] -drive file=rbd:volumes/volume-[...],cache=writeback      Post-migration, QEMU command-line for the Nova instance:          [...] -drive file=rbd:volumes/volume-[...],cache=writeback  --- Additional comment from Martin Schuppert on 2018-02-14 11:25:30 EST ---  OSP8 is also affected by this:  # rpm -q openstack-nova-compute openstack-nova-compute-12.0.6-21.el7ost.noarch  * before migration:     <disk type='network' device='disk'>       <driver name='qemu' type='raw' cache='writeback' discard='unmap'/>       <auth username='cinder'>         <secret type='ceph' uuid='475b69d9-9ea3-4356-ac22-762b17a875e3'/>       </auth>       <source protocol='rbd' name='osp8-vms/9715a493-60be-4d76-9d4c-34b37dad7366_disk'>         <host name='192.168.122.5' port='6789'/>         <host name='192.168.122.6' port='6789'/>         <host name='192.168.122.7' port='6789'/>       </source>       <backingStore/>       <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>       <alias name='virtio-disk0'/>       <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x04' function='0x0'/>     </disk>     <disk type='network' device='disk'>       <driver name='qemu' type='raw' cache='writeback'/>       <auth username='cinder'>         <secret type='ceph' uuid='475b69d9-9ea3-4356-ac22-762b17a875e3'/>       </auth>       <source protocol='rbd' name='osp8-volumes/volume-ce556e6c-dab1-40c2-b186-762d1f8afd4e'>         <host name='192.168.122.5' port='6789'/>         <host name='192.168.122.6' port='6789'/>         <host name='192.168.122.7' port='6789'/>       </source>       <backingStore/>       <target dev='vdb' bus='virtio'/>       <serial>ce556e6c-dab1-40c2-b186-762d1f8afd4e</serial>       <alias name='virtio-disk1'/>       <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x06' function='0x0'/>     </disk>   * after migration:      <disk type='network' device='disk'>       <driver name='qemu' type='raw' cache='writeback' discard='unmap'/>       <auth username='cinder'>         <secret type='ceph' uuid='475b69d9-9ea3-4356-ac22-762b17a875e3'/>       </auth>       <source protocol='rbd' name='osp8-vms/9715a493-60be-4d76-9d4c-34b37dad7366_disk'>         <host name='192.168.122.5' port='6789'/>         <host name='192.168.122.6' port='6789'/>         <host name='192.168.122.7' port='6789'/>       </source>       <backingStore/>       <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>       <alias name='virtio-disk0'/>       <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x04' function='0x0'/>     </disk>     <disk type='network' device='disk'>       <driver name='qemu' type='raw' cache='none'/>       <auth username='cinder'>         <secret type='ceph' uuid='475b69d9-9ea3-4356-ac22-762b17a875e3'/>       </auth>       <source protocol='rbd' name='osp8-volumes/volume-ce556e6c-dab1-40c2-b186-762d1f8afd4e'>         <host name='192.168.122.5' port='6789'/>         <host name='192.168.122.6' port='6789'/>         <host name='192.168.122.7' port='6789'/>       </source>       <backingStore/>       <target dev='vdb' bus='virtio'/>       <serial>ce556e6c-dab1-40c2-b186-762d1f8afd4e</serial>       <alias name='virtio-disk1'/>       <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x06' function='0x0'/>     </disk>  works with: # diff -u driver.py.org driver.py --- driver.py.org       2018-02-14 11:00:23.986251918 -0500 +++ driver.py   2018-02-14 11:12:07.310126939 -0500 @@ -1074,8 +1074,10 @@          driver.disconnect_volume(connection_info, disk_dev)        def _get_volume_config(self, connection_info, disk_info): -

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2714)

## Topic

An update for openstack-nova is now available for Red Hat OpenStack
Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and
controlling access through users and projects.

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-nova: Swapping encrypted volumes can allow an attacker to corrupt the LUKS header causing a denial of service in the host (CVE-2017-18191)

For more details about the security issue, including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the MTU of TAP devices was not configured. As a result, the network could be configured with a different MTU than a guest TAP device.

With this update, you can configure libvirt when you create the TAP device for the guest. Nova passes the correct parameter to libvirt, and the TAP device now has the same configuration as the network. (BZ#1553839)

* Previously, the MTU of TAP devices was not configured. As a result, the network could be configured with a different MTU than a guest TAP device.

With this update, you can configure libvirt when you create the TAP device for the guest. Nova passes the correct parameter to libvirt, and the TAP device now has the same configuration as the network. (BZ#1553559)

* Previously, the '[vnc] keymap' option was 'en-us' by default, and it was not possible to unset this configuration. As a result of this, non-US locales experienced ineffective key mappings.

With this update, users can unset the '[vnc] keymap' value. In this case, the VNC client configures the locale and non-US users attain more effective key mappings. (BZ#1441962)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=154757#c0)  Richard Plana    2005-04-13 23:38:21 UTC  ``` From Bugzilla Helper: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050323 Firefox/1.0.2 Fedora/1.0.2-1.3.1  Description of problem: Using the rescuecd.iso image to boot Anaconda from the CD-ROM. The DVD ISO image is on /dev/hda6 of an 80GB harddisk. After selecting Hard Disk as medium, /dev/hda6 and the proper subdirectory (/fedora/linux/core/test/3.91/i386/iso), something in the installation process triggers what looks like a kernel oops (hard to tell because of the output format as a result of being in ncurses mode).  Snippets of errors I see: "/sbin/loader", "buffer overflow"  I tried booting into Rescue mode and mounting the DVD ISO image:  # mkdir /tmp/hdimage # mkdir /tmp/loopimage # mount /dev/hda6 /tmp/hdimage # mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop /tmp/hdimage/fedora/linux/core/test/3.91/i386/iso/FC4-test2-i386-DVD.iso /tmp/loopimage  to no avail. Depending on the mount options, I'd either get "File too large." "Could not setup loop device" (using "-o loop") or invalid file descriptor (using "-o loop,ro").  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: (See Description.)  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=154757#c1)  Jeremy Katz    2005-04-14 21:16:23 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [154715](show_bug.cgi?id=154715 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - buffer overflow when installer tries to load locally stored ISO image") ***   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c0)  Pierre-Andre MOREY    2017-04-13 08:28:21 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  By default, the instances are launched with '-k en-us' option. This enables an old code path which has drawbacks for other keyboard mappings. For example French, Belgium and Spanish (and much more) won't be able to use a combination of Alt-gr + Key on the web console.  We need to remove the default for the keymap, which is deprecated in modern qemu-kvm as I was told.  This way we can get the proper behavior (with some NoVNC patchs, that are upstream, sross made a patch set for RHOSP8).  An Upstream bug has been opened on this subject.  Regards, Pierre-André   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c3)  Pierre-Andre MOREY    2017-05-09 08:40:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1277313](attachment.cgi?id=1277313 "Remove any default keymap option for kvm (deprecated).") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1277313&action=edit "Remove any default keymap option for kvm (deprecated).") Remove any default keymap option for kvm (deprecated).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c4)  Pierre-Andre MOREY    2017-05-09 08:43:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1277316](attachment.cgi?id=1277316 "Backport from Solly Ross for proper keymap support on NoVnc (novnc-0.6.1-1.el7ost.noarch.rpm)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1277316&action=edit "Backport from Solly Ross for proper keymap support on NoVnc (novnc-0.6.1-1.el7ost.noarch.rpm)") Backport from Solly Ross for proper keymap support on NoVnc (novnc-0.6.1-1.el7ost.noarch.rpm)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c7)  Stephen Finucane    2017-07-14 15:20:18 UTC  ``` Per comments on the upstream bug, it seems this option is not deprecated. In addition, the man page for qemu-kvm specifically states:    -k language     Use keyboard layout language (for example "fr" for French). This option is only     needed where it is not easy to get raw PC keycodes (e.g. on Macs, with some X11     servers or with a VNC or curses display). You don't normally need to use it on     PC/Linux or PC/Windows hosts.  Given that we are using VNC, this seems like the correct thing to do. Could we not simply set the correct language in 'nova.conf'?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c9)  Pierre-Andre MOREY    2017-07-17 07:30:36 UTC  ``` Hi Stephen,  No, even setting the correct keymap doesn't fix the issue. We really need to unset this option.  Regards, Pierre-André   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c10)  Stephen Finucane    2017-07-18 14:38:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Pierre-Andre MOREY from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c9)) > Hi Stephen, >  > No, even setting the correct keymap doesn't fix the issue. We really need to > unset this option.  Yes, Dan Barrange's comments on the upstream bug helped clarify the issue.  I've created a patch upstream that deprecates these options and unsets their defaults, similar to what Solly Ross had done previously. I'm not sure if this is likely to land in this cycle, given the short number of days remaining, but I'll work on it. If not, it should land early next cycle and parts of it can probably be backported.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c11)  Stephen Finucane    2017-08-04 13:28:04 UTC  ``` The patch for this is up, but it will have to wait until features can be merged again before getting in.  How far do you envision backporting this, Pierre-Andre?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c12)  Pierre-Andre MOREY    2017-08-07 15:06:06 UTC  ``` Hi Stephen,  Customer is planning a OSP8 to OSP10 upgrade in September, so for me having it in a OSP10 seems sufficient.  This also depends on an upstream fix for NoVnc, so both should be backported on the target release. I will check if the novnc shipped with OSP10 already includes the proper NoVnc patch.  Regards, Pierre-André   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c15)  Stephen Finucane    2017-08-23 10:31:06 UTC  ``` I've split the upstream patch into two parts - one that allows users to unset the configuration option (and warns them about side effects if set), and another that'll deprecate the option and unset the default. The former is backportable while I doubt the latter is. Let's see how we progress.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1441962#c20)  Alex McLeod    2018-09-03 08:01:22 UTC  ``` Hi there,  If this bug requires doc text for errata release, please set the 'Doc Type' and provide draft text according to the template in the 'Doc Text' field.  The documentation team will review, edit, and approve the text.  If this bug does not require doc text, please set the 'requires_doc_text' flag to -.
