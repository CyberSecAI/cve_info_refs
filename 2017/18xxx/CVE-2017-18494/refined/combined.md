Allows me to enable searching the custom fields in Easy Digital Downloads. Now it is easier to find my products by sku and other custom data.

I don’t know why the new version (from the old discontinued plugin) is so much slower. It would also be nice to have an option on excluding excerpts and only search titles along with the custom fields.

“This plugin allows searching by custom post types on your website.”
Nope. That’s a PRO feature.

If you’re using this for anything where you need a development, staging, and live environments, forget it. They go to such great lengths to validate your license and then break the plugin, it’s rendering it essentially useless for me even though I bought three separate licenses for all my environments. If they would release a version without this licensing issue and rely a bit more on the decency of people to buy a valid license, maybe I would stay a user.
