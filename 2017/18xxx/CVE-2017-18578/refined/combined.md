## Description

This plugin adds a set of social buttons to your website, and includes craft-related social sites like Ravelry, Etsy, Craftsy and Pinterest as well as other major social networks, including WhatsApp. Support for sharing to WhatsApp is also provided on mobile devices. You can choose from nine different button styles to match your theme. You can have the share buttons automatically added to the top or bottom of each post, and can position the link buttons using either a widget, a shortcode or a template action hook.

You can use the share button and link button functions either separately, or together:

**Share Button mode** allows you to put a set of buttons at the top or bottom of each post. Each button will share that post with that particular service. I.e., clicking the facebook icon will open a window for the user to share your post on their Facebook page. Not all services support sharing, for instance, you can’t share via Etsy or Craftsy.

**Link Button mode** lets you configure the buttons to link directly you your profiles on the social networks. I.e. clicking the facebook icon will take the user to your facebook page, clicking the Etsy icon will take them to your Etsy shop. These are designed to be included in either your header, sidebars or footer, as they are not specific to a post. These can be easily included by adding the Social Link Button widget to the area where you want the buttons to appear.

Supported social services include:

* Craftinoo (link only)
* Craftsy (link only)
* Dawanda (link only)
* Digg
* Ebay (link only)
* Email (share only)
* Etsy (link only)
* Facebook
* Flickr (link only)
* Google+
* Instagram (link only)
* LinkedIn
* Pinterest
* Ravelry
* Reddit
* Specific Feeds (link only)
* Stumble Upon
* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Vimeo
* VK
* YouTube
* WhatApp (share only, only on mobile)
* Xing

You can also choose exactly which services you want separately for each mode, so you can can have *Share Buttons* for Ravelry, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter and Email, but have *Link Buttons* for Google+, Craftsy, Pinterest and your Etsy shop.

For more information, see the plugin website at http://sarahhenderson.github.io/Crafty-Social-Buttons/

### Future Editions

These are the things currently in the pipeline:

* Adding the ability to share/link to Flipboard, Goodreads and 500px
* Additional options for layout and style of the buttons
* Shortcode options for more manual control of the buttons
* (Anything else? You tell me!)

## FAQ

Installation Instructions

The easiest way to install is through the WordPress control panel. On the plugins page, search for *Crafty Social Buttons* and click Install. Once installed, Activate the plugin.

You can also download the plugin and then follow these steps:

1. Upload the whole `crafty-social-buttons` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

Once you have activated, you will see a message bar confirming that it has been installed, with a convenient link to the settings page where you can configure the options for how and where the buttons will appear.

You will also find a new Widget called Crafty Social Link Buttons, which can be added to any widget area in your theme.

Can I add a different set of icons?

Yes! There are instructions in the help section of the Plugin (pull down the help menu in the top right of the WordPress admin, or at the plugin webpage (http://sarahhenderson.github.io/Crafty-Social-Buttons/#adding-icons).

Can I add a different social/craft network ?

I’m happy to take requests for new services to add.

Can I have more control over where to put the icons?

Yes! The buttons can also be included in any post or page by using one of these shortcodes:

* [csblink] for the *Link buttons*
* [csbshare] for the *Share buttons*
* [csbnone] will hide the *Share buttons* on a post/page where they would otherwise normally appear

If your theme doesn’t have a widget area where you want the buttons to be placed, you can include them by editing your theme template. Just include one of these links in your template to generate the buttons:

* `<?php do_action('crafty-social-link-buttons'); ?>`
* `<?php do_action('crafty-social-share-buttons'); ?>` (inside loop)
* `<?php do_action('crafty-social-share-page-buttons'); ?>` (outside loop)

Since the *Share buttons* are page/post specific, the shortcode is usually best, and since the *Link buttons* are site/site owner specific, the widget or action hook will normally be a better choice.
