- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `mpc8_probe` function in `libavformat/mpc8.c` has a heap-based buffer over-read issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer over-read
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (application crash)
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted audio file can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a crafted audio file to the vulnerable application. The vulnerability is triggered on 32-bit systems.
