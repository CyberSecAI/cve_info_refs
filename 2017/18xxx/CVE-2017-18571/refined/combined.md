## Description

Search Everything improves WordPress default search functionality without modifying any of the template pages. You can configure it to search pages, excerpts, attachments, drafts, comments, tags and custom fields (metadata) and you can specify your own search highlight style. It also offers the ability to exclude specific pages and posts. It does not search password-protected content. Simply install, configure… and search.

Search Everything plugin now includes a writing helper called Research Everything that lets you search for your posts and link to them while writing. You can also enable Power Search to research posts from the wider web (for WP3.7 and above).

#### Better WordPress search in three steps

* Activate

It doesn’t search in my PDF/Word/Excel attachments

We know, this is not a bug. It’s not that easy to search through binary files.

Anyway, if there’s a will, there’s a way. Just ask us for a workaround and we’ll gladly help.

It doesn’t work

Read the installation guide.

It \*still\* doesn’t work

As others have noted, this plugin has been abandoned, and has broken sites’ search functions for quite some time. Don’t install this, and if you have it installed, delete it.

I am updating my rating for this plug-in.
The Search Everything plug-in used to work great and allow my Easy Digital Downloads content to be fully searchable. It appears that the functions which this tool uses have been deprecated since it stopped working with a recent WordPress update. Reinstalling doesn’t fix the issue.
This plug-in has been abandoned and does not work on modern WordPress installations.

When the plugin is active, a backend search on the Orders page of WooCommerce always loads zero results. It’s just a custom post type so I’m not sure what the issue is but be aware if you use Woo.

Throws a fatal error when adding a new post with WP 5.3. We commented out the action on line:935 – which might break some functionality of the plugin, but at least we can add blog posts.

This plugin is completely outdated and breaks several other plugins, including Advanced Custom Fields. It should be removed from the directory. DO NOT USE.
