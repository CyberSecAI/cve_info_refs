The provided content is related to CVE-2017-18783.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the web interface of several Netgear router models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when they interact with the affected Netgear router's web interface. This could potentially lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to:
* Stealing session cookies
* Redirecting users to malicious websites
* Performing actions on behalf of the user
* Modifying the router configuration

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected Netgear router models. An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized and are subsequently displayed on the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to identify a vulnerable entry point within the web interface of an affected Netgear router. The attacker would then need to craft a malicious payload containing JavaScript code and inject it into the vulnerable entry point. User interaction (e.g. accessing the affected page with the malicious payload) is required for the attack to be successful.
