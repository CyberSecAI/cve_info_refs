Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak vulnerability exists in the `ReadMATImage` function within the `coders/mat.c` file of ImageMagick. This occurs when processing a specially crafted MAT file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The `ReadMATImage` function allocates memory without properly freeing it when processing a crafted MAT file, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Repeated exploitation of the memory leak can cause the application to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial of service. It can potentially crash the application due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted MAT file: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted MAT image file as input to ImageMagick.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted MAT file to a system using ImageMagick. This could occur via a user opening the malicious file, or a server-side process processing a file upload, for example.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided github content includes a stack trace showing the memory allocation flow leading to the leak, and a sample malicious MAT file is provided as a proof-of-concept.
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3681-1) lists this CVE (CVE-2017-18029) among a large list of other vulnerabilities fixed in the same update. The USN mentions that attackers can potentially cause DoS or execute code, though the github issue only confirms DoS via memory leak.
