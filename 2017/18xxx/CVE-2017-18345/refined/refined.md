{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Joomla! Component Joomanager 2.0.0 and possibly earlier versions, allow arbitrary file download due to insufficient path sanitization in the 'download' task.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Arbitrary file download vulnerability",
    "Insufficient path sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, potentially leading to further compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a specific URL to the 'download' task within the 'com_joomanager' component and specifying a path to a file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the location of a vulnerable Joomla! site and have the ability to send HTTP requests."
