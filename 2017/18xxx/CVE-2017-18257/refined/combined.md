f2fs: fix a dead loop in f2fs\_fiemap()

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/b86e33075ed1909d8002745b56ecf73b833db143)

```
A dead loop can be triggered in f2fs_fiemap() using the test case
as below:

	...
	fd = open();
	fallocate(fd, 0, 0, 4294967296);
	ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_FIEMAP, fiemap_buf);
	...

It's caused by an overflow in __get_data_block():
	...
	bh->b_size = map.m_len << inode->i_blkbits;
	...
map.m_len is an unsigned int, and bh->b_size is a size_t which is 64 bits
on 64 bits archtecture, type conversion from an unsigned int to a size_t
will result in an overflow.

In the above-mentioned case, bh->b_size will be zero, and f2fs_fiemap()
will call get_data_block() at block 0 again an again.

Fix this by adding a force conversion before left shift.

## Details

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the perf subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18255](/security/CVE-2017-18255))

Wei Fang discovered an integer overflow in the F2FS filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18257](/security/CVE-2017-18257))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

It was discovered that the wait4() system call in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-10087](/security/CVE-2018-10087))

It was discovered that the kill() system call implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2018-10124](/security/CVE-2018-10124))

Julian Stecklina and Thomas Prescher discovered that FPU register states

(such as MMX, SSE, and AVX registers) which are lazily restored are

potentially vulnerable to a side channel attack. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-3665](/security/CVE-2018-3665))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the

floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-7755](/security/CVE-2018-7755))

Seunghun Han discovered an information leak in the ACPI handling code in

the Linux kernel when handling early termination of ACPI table loading. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive informal (kernel address

locations). ([CVE-2017-13695](/security/CVE-2017-13695))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-10021](/security/CVE-2018-10021))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3696-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the perf subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18255](/security/CVE-2017-18255))

Wei Fang discovered an integer overflow in the F2FS filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18257](/security/CVE-2017-18257))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

It was discovered that the wait4() system call in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-10087](/security/CVE-2018-10087))

It was discovered that the kill() system call implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2018-10124](/security/CVE-2018-10124))

Julian Stecklina and Thomas Prescher discovered that FPU register states

(such as MMX, SSE, and AVX registers) which are lazily restored are

potentially vulnerable to a side channel attack. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-3665](/security/CVE-2018-3665))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the

floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-7755](/security/CVE-2018-7755))

Seunghun Han discovered an information leak in the ACPI handling code in

the Linux kernel when handling early termination of ACPI table loading. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive informal (kernel address

locations). ([CVE-2017-13695](/security/CVE-2017-13695))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-10021](/security/CVE-2018-10021))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1024-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)

* [linux-image-4.4.0-130-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial)
  -
  [4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-xenial/4.4.0-130.156~14.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

CVE-2017-17975

    Tuba Yavuz reported a use-after-free flaw in the USBTV007
    audio-video grabber driver. A local user could use this for denial
    of service by triggering failure of audio registration.

CVE-2017-18193

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    handle extent trees, allowing a local user to cause a denial of
    service via an application with multiple threads.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18218

    Jun He reported a user-after-free flaw in the Hisilicon HNS ethernet
    driver. A local user could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18222

    It was reported that the Hisilicon Network Subsystem (HNS) driver
    implementation does not properly handle ethtool private flags. A
    local user could use this for denial of service or possibly have
    other impact.

CVE-2017-18224

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem omits the use of a
    semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the
    extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode. A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18241

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the "noflush_merge" mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-18257

    It was reported that the f2fs implementation is prone to an infinite
    loop caused by an integer overflow in the __get_data_block()
    function. A local user can use this for denial of service via
    crafted use of the open and fallocate system calls with an
    FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl.

CVE-2018-1065

    The syzkaller tool found a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    netfilter subsystem when handling certain malformed iptables
    rulesets. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability (in any user namespace) could use this to cause a denial
    of service. Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1108

    Jann Horn reported that crng_ready() does not properly handle the
    crng_init variable states and the RNG could be treated as
    cryptographically safe too early after system boot.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7480

    Hou Tao discovered a double-free flaw in the blkcg_init_queue()
    function in block/blk-cgroup.c. A local user could use this to cause
    a denial of service or have other impact.

CVE-2018-7566

    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8087

    A memory leak flaw was found in the hwsim_new_radio_nl() function in
    the simulated radio testing tool driver for mac80211, allowing a
    local user to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-10323

    Wen Xu reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    xfs_bmapi_write() function triggered when mounting and operating a
    crafted xfs filesystem image. A local user able to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.88-1.

f2fs: fix a dead loop in f2fs\_fiemap()A dead loop can be triggered in f2fs\_fiemap() using the test case
as below:
...
fd = open();
fallocate(fd, 0, 0, 4294967296);
ioctl(fd, FS\_IOC\_FIEMAP, fiemap\_buf);
...
It's caused by an overflow in \_\_get\_data\_block():
...
bh->b\_size = map.m\_len << inode->i\_blkbits;
...
map.m\_len is an unsigned int, and bh->b\_size is a size\_t which is 64 bits
on 64 bits archtecture, type conversion from an unsigned int to a size\_t
will result in an overflow.
In the above-mentioned case, bh->b\_size will be zero, and f2fs\_fiemap()
will call get\_data\_block() at block 0 again an again.
Fix this by adding a force conversion before left shift.
