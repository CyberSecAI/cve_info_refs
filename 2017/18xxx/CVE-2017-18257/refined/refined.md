Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18257:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow within the `__get_data_block()` function in the F2FS filesystem implementation.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- The `map.m_len` variable is an unsigned integer, and `bh->b_size` is a `size_t`. When `map.m_len` is left-shifted by `inode->i_blkbits` and the result is assigned to `bh->b_size`, an integer overflow can occur on 64-bit architectures, because of implicit type conversion from `unsigned int` to `size_t` . This results in `bh->b_size` becoming zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When `bh->b_size` becomes zero, the `f2fs_fiemap()` function will repeatedly call `get_data_block()` at block 0, leading to a dead loop. This results in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted sequence of system calls such as `open()`, `fallocate()`, and `ioctl()` with the `FS_IOC_FIEMAP` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
  ```c
  bh->b_size = map.m_len << inode->i_blkbits;
  ```
- The fix involves adding an explicit type cast:
  ```c
  bh->b_size = (u64)map.m_len << inode->i_blkbits;
  ```
- The `f2fs_fiemap()` function calls `get_data_block` in a loop with `offset +=  bh->b_size`, when `bh->b_size` equals zero, the loop never terminates.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by performing `fallocate` to allocate a large file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves explicitly casting `map.m_len` to `u64` before left shifting. This ensures that the calculation for `bh->b_size` is performed using 64-bit arithmetic, preventing the overflow.
- The exploit requires a specific sequence of operations, including `fallocate` and `FS_IOC_FIEMAP`.
- The `usn.ubuntu.com` content confirms the vulnerability and its impact as a denial of service. It also indicates that the fix is included in the updated kernel packages.
- The Debian security advisory also confirms this vulnerability in the Linux kernel, and mentions that local user can cause denial of service by crafted usage of `open` and `fallocate` system calls with `FS_IOC_FIEMAP` ioctl.
