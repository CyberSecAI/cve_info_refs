    *   **Root Cause:** An old routine from the original StatPress plugin contained vulnerabilities related to XSS and SQL injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Unspecified vulnerabilities in an older Statpress routine
    *   **Impact:** Could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts (XSS) or manipulate the database (SQL injection).
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Unspecified.
    *    **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.
*   **Reflected XSS (version 1.0.6):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A reflected XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  The exact nature is not specified but was fixed in version 1.0.6
    *   **Impact:**  Could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into a user's browser session
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Unspecified.
   *    **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.
*   **XSS and SQL Injection (version 1.0.5):**
    *   **Root Cause:** An IMG tag was vulnerable to both XSS and SQL Injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of input in the IMG tag
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could execute arbitrary code or manipulate the database.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Unspecified.
    *    **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.
*   **Persistent XSS (version 1.0.4):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A persistent XSS vulnerability via the HTTP Referer header.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper sanitization of the HTTP Referer header before storage and display.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could inject malicious scripts that would execute in the browsers of other users.
     *   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulation of the HTTP Referer header.
     *    **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.
*   **SQL Injection (version 1.0.1):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A SQL injection vulnerability in the search code.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input used in a SQL query.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially manipulate or gain unauthorized access to the database.
     *  **Attack Vectors:** Unspecified, but related to search functionality.
     *  **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.
*   **XSS and SQL injection (version 0.9.9):**
    *   **Root Cause:** XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the search routine from the original Statpress code.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input used in a SQL query and other parts of the search routine.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially manipulate or gain unauthorized access to the database or execute malicious code.
     *  **Attack Vectors:** Unspecified, but related to search functionality.
     *  **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (version 1.2.5):**
     *   **Root Cause:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
     *   **Weaknesses:** Improper sanitization of stored data
     *   **Impact:** Could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts
      *   **Attack Vectors:** Unspecified.
       *    **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.
* **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (version 1.3.6)**
    *   **Root Cause:** A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability
    *   **Weaknesses:**  The exact nature is not specified but was fixed in version 1.3.6
    *   **Impact:**  Could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into a user's browser session
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Unspecified.
     *    **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.
* **Potential SQL Injection (version 1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.3.5)**
    *   **Root Cause:** Potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input used in a SQL query.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially manipulate or gain unauthorized access to the database.
     *  **Attack Vectors:** Unspecified, but related to data sanitization.
     *  **Required Capabilities/Position**: Unspecified.

**Note:**
- The document emphasizes the importance of always updating to the latest version of the plugin to avoid security issues.
- Many of the fixes are described as "sanitization" or "code cleaning," indicating that the vulnerabilities stemmed from inadequate input validation and output encoding.
- The document does not contain details to link the vulnerabilities to CVE-2017-18575, but it mentions that older version below 1.0.6 has XSS and SQL injections from an old Statpress routine.
