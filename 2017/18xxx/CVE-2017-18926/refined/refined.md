  "CVE-2017-18926": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to an error in calculating the maximum nspace declarations, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the `raptor` library when parsing RDF files.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow"
      ],
       "Impact": "Denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vector": "Processing a specially crafted RDF file.",
      "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to provide a malicious RDF file to the vulnerable application (e.g., LibreOffice)."
    },
   "Additional Information": {
      "Timeline": "The vulnerability was initially reported in 2017, but a CVE was not assigned until later. This caused delays in patching the vulnerability across various Linux distributions. The vulnerability was fixed in Fedora 31, 32, and 33 via updates released in November 2020.",
      "Affected Software": "The vulnerability affects the `raptor` RDF parsing library. It's notably used by LibreOffice, making it a triggerable vector through ODT files.",
       "Patch Details": "The fix involves correcting the calculation of maximum nspace declarations, addressing the root cause of the buffer overflow. The patch was backported to older versions of the affected software.",
        "CVE Assignment Issues":"The lack of a CVE assignment in 2017 was highlighted as a key factor in the delayed patching across different distros. It was emphasized that CVEs are essential for tracking and coordinating fixes for security vulnerabilities."
