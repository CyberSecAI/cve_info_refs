Plugin description reads, “Add new and manage existing user roles.” The plugin does not allow this unless you purchase a pro version. So… Better use the Force, Luke (or at least some other plugin).
Unchecking the ‘Show pro options’ setting only hides the contents of the ‘Add new role’ page.

This plugin does not allow you to delete roles. At least not in 2020

If you want to create a new user role you need the pro version – this was the only reason I needed this plugin, hence the low rating.
