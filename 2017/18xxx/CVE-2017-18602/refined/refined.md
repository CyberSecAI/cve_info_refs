```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The IBPS Online Exam WordPress plugin contains both a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into input textfields during exam attempts, which is later executed when viewing exam results.
    - Blind SQL Injection:  The `id` parameter in the `examapp_UserResult` page is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Stored XSS: An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in user's session. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    - Blind SQL Injection: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- Attack vectors:
    - Stored XSS: An authenticated user (student) injects malicious code via input fields during an exam. The payload executes when the user views their exam results.
    - Blind SQL Injection: An attacker manipulates the 'id' parameter in the 'examapp_UserResult' page via a GET request.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - For the XSS vulnerability, the attacker must be a logged-in student of the WordPress site.
    - For the Blind SQL Injection vulnerability, the attacker also needs to be a logged-in student
