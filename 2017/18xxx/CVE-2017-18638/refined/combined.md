## Package

graphite-web
(pypi)

## Affected versions

< 1.1.6

## Patched versions

1.1.6

## Description

### Impact

send\_email in graphite-web/webapp/graphite/composer/views.py in Graphite through 1.1.5 is vulnerable to SSRF. The vulnerable SSRF endpoint can be used by an attacker to have the Graphite web server request any resource. The response to this SSRF request is encoded into an image file and then sent to an e-mail address that can be supplied by the attacker. Thus, an attacker can exfiltrate any information. Email will be send through SMTP server configured in Graphite, by default it's 'localhost'

### Patches

Problem was patched in Graphite-web 1.1.6. Also patches was released for graphite-web [1.0.x](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/pull/2501) and [0.9.x](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/pull/2500), and we'll discuss releases of non-supported branches later.

### Workarounds

You can manually remove function `send_email` from file `webapp/graphite/composer/views.py`. This function are not in use and will not affect your Graphite installation.

### References

For more information check this graphite-web Github issue [#2008](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/issues/2008)

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2017-18638

### Weaknesses

Package        : graphite-web
Version        : 0.9.12+debian-6+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-18638

The 'send_email' function in graphite-web/webapp/graphite/composer/views.py
in Graphite is vulnerable to SSRF. The vulnerable SSRF endpoint can be used
by an attacker to have the Graphite web server request any resource.
The response to this SSRF request is encoded into an image file and then sent
to an e-mail address that can be supplied by the attacker. Thus, an attacker
can exfiltrate any information.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.9.12+debian-6+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphite-web packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

It's insecure, not used in the code and undocumented.

Fixing [#2008](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/issues/2008)

Please also note that sending email from Dashboard is implemented in completely different commit 'e2a70d8' and not use 'send\_email' function at all.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| You also need to remove the call to this endpoint from inside of the UI, unless that UI component uses some newer logic.  That's a point - there's no call from UI exist. Or any other call. It looks like some abandoned piece of code, which was never used. |
