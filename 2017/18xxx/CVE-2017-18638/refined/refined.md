Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-18638:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `send_email` function in `graphite-web/webapp/graphite/composer/views.py` within Graphite is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF:** The `send_email` function allows an attacker to make the Graphite server request arbitrary resources. This is because the function takes a URL as input without proper validation.
- **Data Exfiltration:** The response from the SSRF request is encoded into an image file and sent to a attacker-controlled email address. This allows for the exfiltration of sensitive information from internal systems that the Graphite server can access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can use the vulnerable `send_email` endpoint to have the Graphite web server request any resource accessible to it, including internal systems.
- An attacker can exfiltrate sensitive information by having the response to the SSRF request sent to an attacker-controlled email.
- The impact is rated as high severity

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker can send a crafted request to the `send_email` endpoint.
- The URL to fetch is controlled by the attacker, as is the email address the response is sent to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Graphite web server and have access to the internet in order to receive emails containing exfiltrated data.
- No authentication needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Graphite versions prior to 1.1.6.
- Patches were released for older branches (1.0.x and 0.9.x) as well.
- A workaround was provided, recommending manual removal of the vulnerable `send_email` function because it is not used by the application.
- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the `send_email` function entirely, and also removing the associated SMTP server configuration setting, as it was unused elsewhere.
- The `send_email` function was deemed abandoned and not used by the application
