{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Parity Browser, a built-in dapp/web-browsing functionality within the Parity Ethereum client, proxies all requests through the Parity main process. This resulted in every website navigated through the browser having the same origin (http://localhost:8080), which bypasses the browser's Same-Origin Policy (SOP). Additionally, the proxy URLs contained a reusable, non-secret cache token, allowing a malicious dapp to reuse this token for accessing any other proxied website/dapp.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-346: Origin Validation Error",
      "Bypassed Same-Origin Policy (SOP)",
       "Reusable non-secret proxy token",
       "Lack of token-to-origin binding"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and access sensitive information, including cookies, and gain full script/XHR control of other websites/dapps proxied through Parity. This could be leveraged to perform user interactions, inject scripts/DOM elements, steal data, or cause other unspecified damage.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious website or dapp loaded through the Parity Browser could exploit the vulnerability.",
      "An attacker could reuse a proxy token from one website to navigate to another website in a same-origin iframe, granting full control."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious website or dapp that can be accessed through the vulnerable Parity browser, and knowledge of how to decode the proxy URLs, extract the token, and reuse it."
