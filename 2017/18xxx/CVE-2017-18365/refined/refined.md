- **Root cause of vulnerability**: XML signature wrapping in SAML authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SAML authentication bypass due to the ability to manipulate the XML signature.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a valid SAML assertion can bypass authentication and sign in as any user, including administrators, gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Attacker needs access to a validly signed SAML assertion or response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs a valid SAML assertion or response and knowledge of how to manipulate the XML signature for wrapping.
