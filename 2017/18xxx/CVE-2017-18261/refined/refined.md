Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-18261:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a potential infinite recursion within the `arch_timer_reg_read_stable()` function when certain tracing options are enabled on platforms with an ARM architecture timer erratum workaround. Specifically, when PREEMPT_TRACER and FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER are selected, the `preempt_disable()` instrumentation attempts to acquire a timestamp via `trace_clock()`, which in turn calls `arch_timer_reg_read_stable()` again, leading to recursion and a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Infinite Recursion:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for infinite recursion due to the interaction between tracing mechanisms and the erratum workaround in the ARM architecture timer.
- **Stack Overflow:** The recursion can lead to a stack overflow, which can crash the system or cause other unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** The stack overflow resulting from the infinite recursion can crash the affected system.
- **Denial of Service:** The crash can lead to a denial-of-service condition, disrupting the system's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by enabling specific tracing options such as `PREEMPT_TRACER` and `FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER` via debugfs.
- Specifically mounting debugfs and writing `function_graph` to `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer` triggers the vulnerability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to mount debugfs, which usually requires root or administrative privileges.
- The attacker needs the ability to write to the `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer` file.

**Additional details:**
- The provided code diff shows the fix: replacing `preempt_disable()` and `preempt_enable()` with `preempt_disable_notrace()` and `preempt_enable_notrace()` within the `arch_timer_reg_read_stable()` function. This prevents the tracing instrumentation from triggering the recursive call.
- The vulnerability is similar to a previously fixed issue related to tracing recursion in `sched_clock_cpu()`.
