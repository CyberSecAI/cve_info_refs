Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability related to CVE-2017-18375 (although, without the CVE description, I'm making assumptions based on the content):

**Note:** The provided blog post details multiple vulnerabilities found in Ampache, but the most prominent and detailed is related to PHP Object Instantiation, which is likely the vulnerability the blog post author was reporting as they were waiting for the CVE to be assigned when they wrote this.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Unsafe Object Instantiation:** The primary vulnerability lies in the `democratic.class.php` file, specifically within the `_add_vote` method. This method takes an `object_type` parameter directly from user input (the `type` GET parameter) and uses it to instantiate a PHP object via `new $object_type($object_id)`. This allows an attacker to control the class name that will be instantiated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PHP Object Instantiation (POI):**  The direct use of user-supplied data to determine the class name for instantiation is a critical vulnerability. This is a form of PHP Object Instantiation (POI), where an attacker can force the application to instantiate an arbitrary class. This is a different form of PHP Object Injection, which is more commonly associated with `unserialize()` calls.
*  **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation**: The `object_type` parameter is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject any class name into it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Object Instantiation:** By controlling the `object_type`, an attacker can instantiate any class that exists within the application's codebase or potentially even trigger autoloader to load a new class.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** If an attacker can find a class with a destructor method `__destruct` or other magic methods or methods called by the `__construct` method that allows them to manipulate the application's state, they may be able to achieve remote code execution (RCE), or other malicious behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `type` GET parameter in the `democratic.ajax.php` script.
*   **Authenticated Access:**  The vulnerability resides within a voting feature that is accessible to authenticated users. An attacker would first need to gain access to an account on the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the web application.
*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account to access the vulnerable voting functionality.
*   **Knowledge of Available Classes:** The attacker would benefit from knowing the class structure of the application to find classes that have exploitable methods, though an attacker could attempt a brute force of classes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post mentions that this form of PHP Object Instantiation is different from traditional POI associated with `unserialize()`. This makes the vulnerability less commonly known and potentially more dangerous.
*   The blog post includes links to other articles that explain this type of attack in detail.
*   While RIPS identified the vulnerability, it is up to the researcher to find the exploit chain to make it exploitable, which the author of the blog post admits to not have yet done.
*   The blog post also mentions other vulnerabilities, such as unquoted SQL injections, bypassed `quote()` methods, uninitialized user agent logging, CSRF vulnerability for changing passwords, and various authenticated XSS and SQLi vulnerabilities. However, these are not related to the described POI vulnerability.

**Summary:**

The primary issue is the usage of user-supplied input to instantiate PHP objects, leading to a PHP Object Instantiation vulnerability that could potentially lead to remote code execution if the attacker can find a useful class to exploit. This vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to control which class is instantiated, impacting the integrity of the application.
