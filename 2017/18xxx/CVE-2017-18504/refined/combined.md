### [BE CAREFUL This plugin has code to collect your email address](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/do-not-use-stealing-your-email-and-tracking-usage-without-consent/)

This plugin appears to have code that will collect your email address, and if it collects usage statistics those are tied directly to your website through the UA sent via the plugin.
There does not appear to be a way to opt out of tracking once the initial notice has been displayed.

The summary text produced for the cards is, unfortunately, random nonsense for many users. No support from developer to correct the problem. It’s left me looking for a different solution that actually works.

Been using this for close to two years now, if I remember correctly, and it works just fine, does its job and you near to never have to think about it again.
Had one issue once (a different plugin generating content that TCM mistook for an excerpt), but support worked (took a while, but some problems just do, I guess) and with a recent update it got solved. Thank you, developers!

I wish if you guys could provide Summary Twitter Card with the Long image. Free of cost.

worked fine for a while, but with the last update, it stopped working. I even paid for the “Summary Card With Large Image” Addon! Customer service is poor, no reaction after several mails…
