The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a command injection vulnerability affecting multiple router models. This advisory is related to CVE-2017-18787.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for command injection into the affected routers.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device, leading to full system compromise, data manipulation, denial of service, and potentially gaining access to the local network.

**Attack vectors:** The advisory does not specify the exact attack vector, only that it's a command injection vulnerability. It is likely that the vulnerability could be exploited through a vulnerable web interface or other network services.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The advisory doesn't specify the attacker position, however since the CVSS vector indicates "AV:L", it is likely that an attacker needs local access to the router to exploit this vulnerability. Although, it's possible that exploitation might be possible remotely via web interface if it is not properly protected.

**Additional information:**
*   The advisory provides a list of affected models and the firmware versions that are vulnerable.
*   It also provides steps to download and install the latest firmware to fix the vulnerability.
*   The advisory also specifies the CVSS v3 score of 8.4 and vector string which points to a critical severity issue.
