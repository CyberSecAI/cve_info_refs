## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3655-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added mitigations in the Linux

kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding

updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

14.04 LTS for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Jan H. Sch√∂nherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle

block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm

could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2017-12134](/security/CVE-2017-12134))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-13220](/security/CVE-2017-13220))

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device

driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18079](/security/CVE-2017-18079))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18221](/security/CVE-2017-18221))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.149.140](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-149.199~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.149.140](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-149.199~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact

the cloud provider to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated

to expose the new CPU features to virtual machines.

# USN-3617-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

3 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

ipmi: Prefer ACPI system interfaces over SMBIOS ones
commit 7e030d6dff713250c7dcfb543cad2addaf479b0e upstream.
The recent changes to add SMBIOS (DMI) IPMI interfaces as platform
devices caused DMI to be selected before ACPI, causing ACPI type
of operations to not work.

coda: fix 'kernel memory exposure attempt' in fsync
commit d337b66a4c52c7b04eec661d86c2ef6e168965a2 upstream.
When an application called fsync on a file in Coda a small request with
just the file identifier was allocated, but the declared length was set
to the size of union of all possible upcall requests.
This bug has been around for a very long time and is now caught by the
extra checking in usercopy that was introduced in Linux-4.8.
The exposure happens when the Coda cache manager process reads the fsync
upcall request at which point it is killed. As a result there is nobody
servicing any further upcalls, trapping any processes that try to access
the mounted Coda filesystem.

mm/page\_ext.c: check if page\_ext is not prepared
commit e492080e640c2d1235ddf3441cae634cfffef7e1 upstream.
online\_page\_ext() and page\_ext\_init() allocate page\_ext for each
section, but they do not allocate if the first PFN is !pfn\_present(pfn)
or !pfn\_valid(pfn). Then section->page\_ext remains as NULL.
lookup\_page\_ext checks NULL only if CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM is enabled. For a
valid PFN, \_\_set\_page\_owner will try to get page\_ext through
lookup\_page\_ext. Without CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM lookup\_page\_ext will misuse
NULL pointer as value 0. This incurrs invalid address access.
This is the panic example when PFN 0x100000 is not valid but PFN
0x13FC00 is being used for page\_ext. section->page\_ext is NULL,
get\_entry returned invalid page\_ext address as 0x1DFA000 for a PFN
0x13FC00.
To avoid this panic, CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM should be removed so that page\_ext
will be checked at all times.

mm/page\_alloc.c: broken deferred calculation
commit d135e5750205a21a212a19dbb05aeb339e2cbea7 upstream.
In reset\_deferred\_meminit() we determine number of pages that must not
be deferred. We initialize pages for at least 2G of memory, but also
pages for reserved memory in this node.
The reserved memory is determined in this function:
memblock\_reserved\_memory\_within(), which operates over physical
addresses, and returns size in bytes. However, reset\_deferred\_meminit()
assumes that that this function operates with pfns, and returns page
count.
The result is that in the best case machine boots slower than expected
due to initializing more pages than needed in single thread, and in the
worst case panics because fewer than needed pages are initialized early.

ipmi: fix unsigned long underflow
commit 392a17b10ec4320d3c0e96e2a23ebaad1123b989 upstream.
When I set the timeout to a specific value such as 500ms, the timeout
event will not happen in time due to the overflow in function
check\_msg\_timeout:
...
ent->timeout -= timeout\_period;
if (ent->timeout > 0)
return;
...
The type of timeout\_period is long, but ent->timeout is unsigned long.
This patch makes the type consistent.

ocfs2: fix cluster hang after a node dies
commit 1c01967116a678fed8e2c68a6ab82abc8effeddc upstream.
When a node dies, other live nodes have to choose a new master for an
existed lock resource mastered by the dead node.
As for ocfs2/dlm implementation, this is done by function -
dlm\_move\_lockres\_to\_recovery\_list which marks those lock rsources as
DLM\_LOCK\_RES\_RECOVERING and manages them via a list from which DLM
changes lock resource's master later.
So without invoking dlm\_move\_lockres\_to\_recovery\_list, no master will be
choosed after dlm recovery accomplishment since no lock resource can be
found through ::resource list.
What's worse is that if DLM\_LOCK\_RES\_RECOVERING is not marked for lock
resources mastered a dead node, it will break up synchronization among
nodes.
So invoke dlm\_move\_lockres\_to\_recovery\_list again.
Fixs: 'commit ee8f7fcbe638 ("ocfs2/dlm: continue to purge recovery lockres when recovery master goes down")'

mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb ranges
commit 373c4557d2aa362702c4c2d41288fb1e54990b7c upstream.
This matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace. It is
probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
tested that.
Removing the `walk->hugetlb\_entry` condition in walk\_hugetlb\_range() has
no effect because the caller already checks for that.
This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
a hugetlb\_entry callback.
This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.

tpm-dev-common: Reject too short writes
commit ee70bc1e7b63ac8023c9ff9475d8741e397316e7 upstream.
tpm\_transmit() does not offer an explicit interface to indicate the number
of valid bytes in the communication buffer. Instead, it relies on the
commandSize field in the TPM header that is encoded within the buffer.
Therefore, ensure that a) enough data has been written to the buffer, so
that the commandSize field is present and b) the commandSize field does not
announce more data than has been written to the buffer.
This should have been fixed with CVE-2011-1161 long ago, but apparently
a correct version of that patch never made it into the kernel.

ima: do not update security.ima if appraisal status is not INTEGRITY\_PASS
commit 020aae3ee58c1af0e7ffc4e2cc9fe4dc630338cb upstream.
Commit b65a9cfc2c38 ("Untangling ima mess, part 2: deal with counters")
moved the call of ima\_file\_check() from may\_open() to do\_filp\_open() at a
point where the file descriptor is already opened.
This breaks the assumption made by IMA that file descriptors being closed
belong to files whose access was granted by ima\_file\_check(). The
consequence is that security.ima and security.evm are updated with good
values, regardless of the current appraisal status.
For example, if a file does not have security.ima, IMA will create it after
opening the file for writing, even if access is denied. Access to the file
will be allowed afterwards.
Avoid this issue by checking the appraisal status before updating
security.ima.

net/sctp: Always set scope\_id in sctp\_inet6\_skb\_msgname
[ Upstream commit 7c8a61d9ee1df0fb4747879fa67a99614eb62fec ]
Alexandar Potapenko while testing the kernel with KMSAN and syzkaller
discovered that in some configurations sctp would leak 4 bytes of
kernel stack.
Working with his reproducer I discovered that those 4 bytes that
are leaked is the scope id of an ipv6 address returned by recvmsg.
With a little code inspection and a shrewd guess I discovered that
sctp\_inet6\_skb\_msgname only initializes the scope\_id field for link
local ipv6 addresses to the interface index the link local address
pertains to instead of initializing the scope\_id field for all ipv6
addresses.
That is almost reasonable as scope\_id's are meaniningful only for link
local addresses. Set the scope\_id in all other cases to 0 which is
not a valid interface index to make it clear there is nothing useful
in the scope\_id field.
There should be no danger of breaking userspace as the stack leak
guaranteed that previously meaningless random data was being returned.

af\_netlink: ensure that NLMSG\_DONE never fails in dumps
[ Upstream commit 0642840b8bb008528dbdf929cec9f65ac4231ad0 ]
The way people generally use netlink\_dump is that they fill in the skb
as much as possible, breaking when nla\_put returns an error. Then, they
get called again and start filling out the next skb, and again, and so
forth. The mechanism at work here is the ability for the iterative
dumping function to detect when the skb is filled up and not fill it
past the brim, waiting for a fresh skb for the rest of the data.
However, if the attributes are small and nicely packed, it is possible
that a dump callback function successfully fills in attributes until the
skb is of size 4080 (libmnl's default page-sized receive buffer size).
The dump function completes, satisfied, and then, if it happens to be
that this is actually the last skb, and no further ones are to be sent,
then netlink\_dump will add on the NLMSG\_DONE part:
nlh = nlmsg\_put\_answer(skb, cb, NLMSG\_DONE, sizeof(len), NLM\_F\_MULTI);
It is very important that netlink\_dump does this, of course. However, in
this example, that call to nlmsg\_put\_answer will fail, because the
previous filling by the dump function did not leave it enough room. And
how could it possibly have done so? All of the nla\_put variety of
functions simply check to see if the skb has enough tailroom,
independent of the context it is in.
In order to keep the important assumptions of all netlink dump users, it
is therefore important to give them an skb that has this end part of the
tail already reserved, so that the call to nlmsg\_put\_answer does not
fail. Otherwise, library authors are forced to find some bizarre sized
receive buffer that has a large modulo relative to the common sizes of
messages received, which is ugly and buggy.
This patch thus saves the NLMSG\_DONE for an additional message, for the
case that things are dangerously close to the brim. This requires
keeping track of the errno from ->dump() across calls.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

USN-3617-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 17.10.

This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware

Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 17.10 for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15129](/security/CVE-2017-15129))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the usbtest device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate endpoint metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16532](/security/CVE-2017-16532))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SoundGraph iMON USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2017-16537](/security/CVE-2017-16537))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IMS Passenger Control Unit USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device descriptors. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2017-16645](/security/CVE-2017-16645))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the DiBcom DiB0700 USB DVB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle detach events. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16646](/security/CVE-2017-16646))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ASIX Ethernet USB driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle suspend and resume events. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2017-16647](/security/CVE-2017-16647))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not

properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16649](/security/CVE-2017-16649))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the QMI WWAN USB driver did not properly

validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16650](/security/CVE-2017-16650))

It was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux kernel did not

properly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-16994](/security/CVE-2017-16994))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17806](/security/CVE-2017-17806))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's

default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-5333](/security/CVE-2018-5333))

ËåÉÈæôÈ£û discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5344](/security/CVE-2018-5344))

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Jan H. Sch√∂nherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle

block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm

could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2017-12134](/security/CVE-2017-12134))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-13220](/security/CVE-2017-13220))

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device

driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18079](/security/CVE-2017-18079))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18221](/security/CVE-2017-18221))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.

we should wait dio requests to finish before inode lock in
ocfs2_setattr(), otherwise the following deadlock will happen:

process 1                  process 2                    process 3
truncate file 'A'          end_io of writing file 'A'   receiving the bast messages
ocfs2_setattr
 ocfs2_inode_lock_tracker
  ocfs2_inode_lock_full
 inode_dio_wait
  __inode_dio_wait
  -->waiting for all dio
  requests finish

                               flag to be cleared, that is waiting
                               for 'process 1' unlocking the inode lock
                           inode_dio_end
                           -->here dec the i_dio_count, but will never
                           be called, so a deadlock happened.
