The content is related to CVE-2017-18641.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- Many LXC template scripts download packages over insecure HTTP and install them without GPG signature verification. This is due to the lack of consideration for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks when the templates were written.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure HTTP downloads of packages
- Lack of GPG signature verification when installing packages (e.g., using `yum --nogpgcheck`, `--no-verify-rpm` or similar)

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution as root within the container. A MITM attacker can inject malicious code into the downloaded packages, which will then be installed and executed as root inside the LXC container.

Attack vectors:
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network where the LXC container is being created. An attacker positioned between the container and the package server can intercept and modify the downloaded packages.
- Web proxy admin or anyone in control of the network path
- An attacker who controls the package repositories

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to perform a MITM attack, such as being on the same network, controlling a network device, or a compromised web proxy.
- Ability to modify network traffic between the container and the remote package servers.
