This is the most porwerfull rating plugin i’ve tested so far.It’s complicated to manipulate, it’s takes time to understand how it works, but it’s the only one that offer many options to play with.Today i’ve tested at least 6 other plugins, but this one is a very solid choice.The free option offers already many options to play with.The plugin have many template to choose from, many designs ( if you don’t want to display stars, you can choose hearts and other designs )i found some dificulties customizing the text render ( i just wanted to display a single heart with number of votes ), but with some search and tests, i could achieve what i wanted.Thanks to the developer for this plugin.

I needed a simple post rating system for a film review site built with Elementor and a custom post type where any logged-in user can leave a review and rate the film. I am not a developer, but I use 20 plugins on the site without a problem, and this one was far too complicated to implement for such a simple application. Even just inserting the rating feature (without the reviews add-on) requires more work than it should. I’m used to plugins with a lot of shortcode options, a highly intuitive interface/dashboard, etc., but this one was not intuitive and pretty frustrating. There were no clear, linear instructions in the documentation (a handful of YouTube videos were nominally helpful but haphazard, and the designer’s how-to articles were very strangely organized and left gaps). It may have deeper features and benefits I’m not aware of, but for a pretty straightforward use, it was not a good fit. Please note: If you use the reviews add-on and want users to be able to leave a rating without taking the time to leave a review, that’s not possible with this. They must leave both.

The configuration is so complicated and there is no good user guide to walk through. Seems like it might be a really powerful plugin, but this is not a simple one to use or understand.
