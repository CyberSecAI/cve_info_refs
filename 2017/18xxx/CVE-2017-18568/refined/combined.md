I hate having to install useless plug-ins that bloat my website. What this plug-in does could easily be included in the other plug-ins. It does the job OK, but it makes for yet another plug-in. If you want to improve speed and simplicity, this plug-in is not it.

It does exactly what it says. Hopefully the developers will update it soon so WordFence no longer shows it as abandoned.
PS: They replied to my report at their customer forum and said they would update it soon.

Simple and powerful PO file editing. A must for non-WPML site translation.
