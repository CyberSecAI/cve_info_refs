The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a command injection vulnerability. Although it does not mention the CVE ID, it references the advisory ID "PSV-2017-2214" and the description of the vulnerability and affected products, which align with CVE-2017-18806.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The advisory specifically mentions a "command injection vulnerability" but doesn't provide further technical details about the vulnerable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is rated as "Medium" with a CVSS v3 score of 6.7. The CVSS vector string indicates:
  - Confidentiality impact: High (C:H)
  - Integrity impact: High (I:H)
  - Availability impact: High (A:H)
  - This suggests that successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the affected device, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, modify configurations, and disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The CVSS vector string indicates the following:
  - Attack Vector: Local (AV:L)
  - Attack Complexity: Low (AC:L)
  - Privileges Required: High (PR:H)
  - User Interaction: None (UI:N)
  - Scope: Unchanged (S:U)
  - This suggests a local attack vector that an attacker with high privileges on the device could exploit, without user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs high privileges on the local device in order to perform a successful attack.
