Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue related to how `ParcelableRttResults` are handled during parceling. Specifically, the `ParcelableRttResults` were not being unparceled correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Unparceling:** The core issue is that  `ParcelableRttResults` data was not correctly restored when being read from a parcel.
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The CVE is classified as an EoP, suggesting that a malicious application could potentially leverage this improper handling to gain elevated access or permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to an elevation of privilege, allowing an attacker to bypass intended security mechanisms and potentially gain control of a privileged process or access protected data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker, likely through a malicious application, could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted data that would be improperly unparceled, leading to unintended behavior or privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run a malicious application on the target Android device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit log from android.googlesource.com indicates that the fix involves correcting the parceling code for `ParcelableRttResults`.
- The Android Security Bulletin from April 2018 lists this CVE as a High severity EoP in the System component with the related AOSP change.
- The fix was backported to Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0 and 8.1.
