The provided document discusses multiple vulnerabilities related to the IEEE P1735 standard, including CVE-2017-13095. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2017-13095

**Root Cause:** The P1735 standard, used for encrypting electronic design intellectual property (IP), is flawed in its handling of license denial responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Modification of License-Deny Response:** An attacker can modify a license-deny response to a license grant.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **IP Theft:** Attackers can recover electronic design IPs encrypted using P1735, leading to theft and analysis of sensitive features.
*   **Hardware Trojan Insertion:** Attackers can insert hardware Trojans into encrypted IP without the owner's knowledge.
*   **Loss of Profit and Reputation:** IP owners may suffer financial losses and damage to their reputation.
*   **Compromised ICs:**  Integrated circuits (ICs) might contain backdoors, perform poorly, or fail completely due to injected Trojans.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The specific attack vector involves manipulating the license-deny response within the P1735 framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the license-deny response. This suggests they may need some access within the design flow or to the encrypted IP itself.
*   The attacker also needs to have enough information to make the modification successful.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in the P1735 standard, including those related to padding oracles, HDL syntax, key modification, and manipulation of rights blocks.
*   The document references a research paper ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/828.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/828.pdf)) for more details.
*   The vulnerability may affect EDA tools that implement the P1735 standard or products designed using such tools.
*   The CVSS score suggests this is a serious vulnerability with high confidentiality and integrity impact.
