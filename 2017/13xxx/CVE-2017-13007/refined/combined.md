Debian Bug     : 867718 873804 873805 873806

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in tcpdump, a command-line
network traffic analyzer. These vulnerabilities might result in denial
of service or, potentially, execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.9.2-1~deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.2-1~deb9u1.

For the testing distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.9.2-1 or earlier versions.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.2-1 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

[1770](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1770) - Redo gmt2local() so that it works under BSDI (which seems to return
[1771](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1771) an empty timezone struct from gettimeofday()). Based on report from
[1772](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1772) Terry Kennedy (terry@spcvxa.spc.edu).
[1773](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1773)

[1776](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1776)
[1777](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1777) - Don't pass cc flags to gcc. Resulted from a bug report from Rainer
[1778](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1778) Orth (ro@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de).

[1781](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1781) Resulted from a bug report from Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu).
[1782](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1782)
[1783](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1783) - Hack around deficiency in Ultrix's make.
[1784](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1784)
[1785](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1785) - Add ETHERTYPE\_TRAIL define which is missing from irix5.
[1786](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1786)

[1792](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1792)
[1793](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1793) - Added support for printing tcp option timestamps thanks to
[1794](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1794) Mark Andrews (mandrews@alias.com).
[1795](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1795)
[1796](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1796) - Reorganize protocol dumpers to take const pointers to packets so they
[1797](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1797) never change the contents (i.e., they used to do endian conversions
[1798](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1798) in place). Previously, whenever more than one pass was taken over
[1799](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1799) the packet, the packet contents would be dumped incorrectly (i.e.,
[1800](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1800) the output form -x would be wrong on little endian machines because
[1801](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1801) the protocol dumpers would modify the data). Thanks to Charles Hannum
[1802](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1802) (mycroft@gnu.ai.mit.edu) for reporting this problem.
[1803](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1803)

[1806](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1806)
[1807](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1807) - Fix bug that caused length of packet to be incorrectly printed
[1808](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1808) (off by ether header size) for unknown ethernet types thanks
[1809](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1809) to Greg Miller (gmiller@kayak.mitre.org).
[1810](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1810)
[1811](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1811) - Added support for IPX protocol dumping thanks to Brad Parker
[1812](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1812) (brad@fcr.com).
[1813](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1813)
[1814](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1814) - Added check to verify IP header checksum under -v thanks to
[1815](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1815) Brad Parker (brad@fcr.com).
[1816](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1816)
[1817](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1817) - Move packet capture code to new libpcap library (which is
[1818](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1818) packaged separately).
[1819](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1819)
[1820](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1820) - Prototype everything and assume an ansi compiler.
[1821](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1821)
[1822](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1822) - print-arp.c: Print hardware ethernet addresses if they're not
[1823](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1823) what we expect.
[1824](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1824)
[1825](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1825) - print-bootp.c: Decode the cmu vendor field. Add RFC1497 tags.
[1826](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1826) Many helpful suggestions from Gordon Ross (gwr@jericho.mc.com).
[1827](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1827)
[1828](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1828) - print-fddi.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul
[1829](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1829) (mogul@pa.dec.com).
[1830](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1830)
[1831](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1831) - print-icmp.c: Byte swap netmask before printing. Thanks to
[1832](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1832) Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu). Print icmp type when unknown.
[1833](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1833)
[1834](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1834) - print-ip.c: Print the inner ip datagram of ip-in-ip encapsulated packets.
[1835](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1835) By default, only the inner packet is dumped, appended with the token
[1836](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1836) "(encap)". Under -v, both the inner and output packets are dumped
[1837](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1837) (on the same line). Note that the filter applies to the original packet,
[1838](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1838) not the encapsulated packet. So if you run tcpdump on a net with an
[1839](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1839) IP Multicast tunnel, you cannot filter out the datagrams using the
[1840](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1840) conventional syntax. (You can filter away all the ip-in-ip traffic
[1841](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1841) with "not ip proto 4".)
[1842](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1842)
[1843](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1843) - print-nfs.c: Keep pending rpc's in circular table. Add generic
[1844](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1844) nfs header and remove os dependences. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.
[1845](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1845)
[1846](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1846) - print-ospf.c: Improvements. Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul.
[1847](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1847)
[1848](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1848) - tcpdump.c: Add -T flag allows interpretation of "vat", "wb", "rpc"
[1849](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1849) (sunrpc) and rtp packets. Added "inbound" and "outbound" keywords

[1894](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1894)
[1895](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1895) - pcap-bpf.c: don't choke when we get ptraced. only set promiscuous
[1896](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1896) for broadcast nets.
[1897](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1897)
[1898](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1898) - print-atal.c: Fix an alignment bug (thanks to
[1899](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1899) stanonik@nprdc.navy.mil) Add missing printf() argument.
[1900](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1900)
[1901](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1901) - print-bootp.c: First attempt at decoding the vendor buffer.

[1919](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1919) (microseconds) worth of precision. Fix uid bugs.
[1920](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1920)
[1921](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1921) - A packet dumper has been added (thanks to Jeff Mogul of DECWRL).
[1922](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1922) With this option, you can create an architecture independent binary
[1923](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1923) trace file in real time, without the overhead of the packet printer.
[1924](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1924) At a later time, the packets can be filtered (again) and printed.
[1925](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1925)
[1926](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1926) - BSD is supported. You must have BPF in your kernel.
[1927](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1927) Since the filtering is now done in the kernel, fewer packets are
[1928](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1928) dropped. In fact, with BPF and the packet dumper option, a measly
[1929](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1929) Sun 3/50 can keep up with a busy network.
[1930](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1930)
[1931](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1931) - Compressed SLIP packets can now be dumped, provided you use our
[1932](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1932) SLIP software and BPF. These packets are dumped as any other IP
[1933](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1933) packet; the compressed headers are dumped with the '-e' option.
[1934](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1934)
[1935](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1935) - Machines with little-endian byte ordering are supported (thanks to
[1936](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1936) Jeff Mogul).
[1937](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1937)
[1938](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1938) - Ultrix 4.0 is supported (also thanks to Jeff Mogul).
[1939](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1939)
[1940](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1940) - IBM RT and Stanford Enetfilter support has been added by
[1941](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1941) Rayan Zachariassen <rayan@canet.ca>. tcpdump has been tested under
[1942](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1942) both the vanilla Enetfilter interface, and the extended interface
[1943](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1943) (#ifdef'd by IBMRTPC) present in the MERIT version of the Enetfilter.
[1944](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1944)
[1945](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1945) - TFTP packets are now printed (requests only).
[1946](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1946)
[1947](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1947) - BOOTP packets are now printed.
[1948](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1948)
[1949](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1949) - SNMP packets are now printed. (thanks to John LoVerso of Xylogics).
[1950](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1950)
[1951](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1951) - Sparc architectures, including the Sparcstation-1, are now
[1952](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1952) supported thanks to Steve McCanne and Craig Leres.
[1953](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1953)
[1954](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1954) - SunOS 4 is now supported thanks to Micky Liu of Columbia
[1955](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1955) University (micky@cunixc.cc.columbia.edu).
[1956](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1956)
[1957](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1957) - IP options are now printed.
[1958](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1958)
[1959](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1959) - RIP packets are now printed.
[1960](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1960)
[1961](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1961) - There's a -v flag that prints out more information than the
[1962](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1962) default (e.g., it will enable printing of IP ttl, tos and id)
[1963](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1963) and -q flag that prints out less (e.g., it will disable
[1964](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1964) interpretation of AppleTalk-in-UDP).
[1965](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1965)
[1966](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1966) - The grammar has undergone substantial changes (if you have an
[1967](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1967) earlier version of tcpdump, you should re-read the manual
[1968](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1968) entry).
[1969](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1969)
[1970](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1970) The most useful change is the addition of an expression
[1971](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1971) syntax that lets you filter on arbitrary fields or values in the
[1972](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1972) packet. E.g., "ip[0] > 0x45" would print only packets with IP
[1973](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1973) options, "tcp[13] & 3 != 0" would print only TCP SYN and FIN
[1974](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1974) packets.
[1975](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1975)
[1976](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1976) The most painful change is that concatenation no longer means
[1977](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1977) "and" -- e.g., you have to say "host foo and port bar" instead
[1978](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1978) of "host foo port bar". The up side to this down is that
[1979](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1979) repeated qualifiers can be omitted, making most filter
[1980](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1980) expressions shorter. E.g., you can now say "ip host foo and
[1981](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1981) (bar or baz)" to look at ip traffic between hosts foo and bar or
[1982](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1982) between hosts foo and baz. [The old way of saying this was "ip
[1983](/tcpdump/blob/HEAD%3A/CHANGES#l1983) host foo and (ip host bar or ip host baz)".]

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[CVE-2017-13007](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pwv5-hg2c-j7f6 "CVE-2017-13007")/PKTAP: Pass a properly updated struct pcap\_pkthdr to t…

…he sub-dissector.

The sub-dissector expects that the length and captured length will
reflect the actual remaining data in the packet, not the raw amount
including the PKTAP header; pass an updated header, just as we do for
PPI.

This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Yannick Formaggio.

Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)
