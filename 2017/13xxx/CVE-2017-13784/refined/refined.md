Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-13784:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a result of an out-of-bounds read within the `WebCore::SimpleLineLayout::RunResolver::runForPoint` function in WebKit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to read memory outside of the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By crafting malicious web content, an attacker can trigger the memory corruption, leading to arbitrary code execution on the target system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  As demonstrated in the provided exploit, the out-of-bounds read can lead to application crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious web content:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted web pages or HTML content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by enticing a victim to visit a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be on the same network, or have local access to the machine.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ivan Fratric of Google Project Zero.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple platforms including iOS, macOS, tvOS, and Windows through Safari, iCloud for Windows and iTunes for Windows and WebKitGTK+.
*   The provided exploit-db content includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability, along with AddressSanitizer (ASan) logs indicating the out-of-bounds read.
*   The issue is resolved by implementing improved memory handling in the WebKit library.
