  "CVE-2017-13027": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-125",
      "Description": "The LLDP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-lldp.c:lldp_mgmt_addr_tlv_print().",
      "Severity": "Critical",
       "CVSSv3": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient bounds check in the LLDP management address TLV parsing function.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The code reads the OID length without checking the size of the data, leading to a buffer over-read."
          ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious LLDP packet.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted LLDP packet to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump."
    },
       "Affected packages": {
         "tcpdump": "versions before 4.9.2 are affected"
        }
