{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The P1735 IEEE standard has flaws in its cryptographic methods, specifically regarding encryption key management.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Modification of the encryption key, which can lead to insertion of hardware trojans in any IP.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An adversary can modify the encryption key, allowing them to insert hardware trojans into the encrypted IP. This can result in the insertion of backdoors, performance degradation, or complete failure of the integrated circuits (ICs). It also leads to IP theft and analysis of security-critical features.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by modifying the encryption key of the electronic design IP.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs knowledge about the IP and the ability to modify the encryption key."
