Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13723:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the X server's X Keyboard Extension (XKB) library generates formatted strings for XKB data. It uses a single, shared, static buffer. This can cause issues when the string to be generated is larger than anticipated, leading to potential buffer overflows or other errors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Static Buffer:** The use of a single, fixed-size static buffer for string generation in the XKB library is the core vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:**  While there is some length checking, it's insufficient to prevent overflows. When a generated string exceeds the static buffer's capacity it can cause unexpected results.
*   **Potential for Overflows:** When the generated string exceeds the static buffer's capacity, a buffer overflow occurs, which can lead to program crashes or arbitrary code execution in the worst case.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause the X server to crash.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** If the overflow is carefully crafted, it could be possible to overwrite adjacent memory locations and execute arbitrary code. However, this requires additional research and precision.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious XKB data:** An attacker would need to send specially crafted XKB data to the X server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to connect to an X server. This could be achieved locally or remotely if the server is exposed.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate XKB data passed to the server.
*   No special privileges are required for exploitation.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
* The fix implemented a ring of resizable buffers to avoid issues with oversized strings, removing the single static buffer.
* The issue was found by Michal Srb of SuSE.
* The fix was integrated by Julien Cristau of Debian, and released by Adam Jackson of Red Hat.
* Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 201710-30 lists this vulnerability as being exploitable by a local attacker.
* Debian Security Advisory DSA-4000-1 and DLA 1186-1 both include fixes for this CVE, indicating this impacts a variety of Debian versions.

This vulnerability is primarily a buffer overflow due to the use of a single static buffer to generate formatted strings within the XKB library. An attacker with access to an X server could send specially crafted XKB data, potentially causing a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
