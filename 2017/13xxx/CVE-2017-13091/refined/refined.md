- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The P1735 IEEE standard, used for encrypting electronic-design intellectual property (IP), has improperly specified padding in CBC mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  -  Improperly specified padding in CBC mode.
  - The standard allows for use of an EDA tool as a decryption oracle.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Recovery of plaintext IP, potentially leading to IP theft.
    -  Analysis of security-critical features.
    -  Insertion of hardware Trojans into encrypted IP.
    -  Potential loss of profit and reputation for IP owners.
    -  Compromised ICs with backdoors or performance issues.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Leveraging the commercial EDA tool as a black-box oracle.
    - Padding oracle attacks due to improperly specified padding in CBC mode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Access to the encrypted IP.
    - Ability to interact with an EDA tool that implements the flawed P1735 standard.
