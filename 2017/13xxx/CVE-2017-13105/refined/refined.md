Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **Improper Certificate Validation** (CWE-295). The affected software, "Virus Cleaner ( Hi Security ) - Antivirus, Booster, 3.7.1.1329" for Android, does not properly validate certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** The application fails to correctly validate certificates, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially perform a MITM attack to spoof a trusted entity.
*   The software may connect to a malicious host believing it is a trusted host.
*   The software may be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.
*   In a worst-case scenario, a remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute commands as a system user if a victim can be enticed to install a malicious app capable of exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the vulnerable application and its server can intercept and manipulate network traffic.
*   **Malicious Third-Party Apps:** Exploitation can occur through malicious third-party apps installed by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the application and its server to carry out a MITM attack.
*   **Malicious App Development/Distribution:** For exploitation through a malicious third-party app, the attacker needs to develop and distribute the malicious app.
*   **User Interaction**: The user must install a malicious app or otherwise interact with a malicious network to trigger the vulnerability.
