Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Incorrect buffer allocation in `libmpeg2` when handling shared display mode, specifically with half pixel references. The allocated buffer is not large enough to accommodate an incorrect half-pel reference to the last row.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow/Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability stems from a buffer allocation issue when processing video with shared display. The allocated buffer is undersized and could lead to out-of-bounds write when handling half pixel references that goes past the last row of the image.
- **Memory Corruption:** A buffer overflow vulnerability that allows an attacker to overwrite memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This is due to the memory corruption that can be leveraged to take control of the vulnerable application process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially crafted file:** An attacker can craft a malicious file that exploits the buffer overflow in libmpeg2. This file can then be processed by the affected Android device, triggering the vulnerability.
- **Remote attack vector:** The content states that a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability. This indicates the attacker does not need physical access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to deliver a specially crafted file:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted file to the vulnerable Android device. This could be through a malicious website, an email attachment or another way that involves the user opening the file.
- **Targeting a vulnerable process:** The attacker needs to target an application or service that uses the vulnerable media framework component to process the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `libmpeg2` library and affects multiple versions of Android (6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1).
- The provided commit fixes the issue by correcting the buffer allocation.
- The severity is categorized as **Critical**.

In summary, CVE-2017-13248 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Media framework caused by incorrect buffer allocation in `libmpeg2`. An attacker can exploit this by delivering a crafted file, leading to arbitrary code execution.
