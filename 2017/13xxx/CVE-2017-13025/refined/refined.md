  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IPv6 mobility parser in tcpdump has a buffer over-read vulnerability in print-mobility.c:mobility_opt_print().",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"

    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service or disclose application memory by sending a crafted IPv6 packet.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a machine running a vulnerable version of tcpdump.",
