Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13086:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content extensively discusses CVE-2017-13086, which is described as:
> reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey (TPK) key in the TDLS handshake

This matches the official CVE description as a vulnerability within wpa\_supplicant related to the TDLS handshake.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is in the processing of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey (TPK) handshake, specifically during the TDLS handshake. The vulnerability arises from the potential for an attacker to manipulate the timing and transmission of handshake messages, leading to out-of-sequence reception or retransmission.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability lies in the potential to force a key reinstallation by replaying handshake messages. This can result in the reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey (TPK), which is an encryption key used in TDLS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker within radio range to replay, decrypt, or spoof frames. This could enable packet decryption, injection, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, or the replay of unicast, broadcast, and multicast frames.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed by an attacker within radio range who can act as a man-in-the-middle, manipulating and replaying specific TDLS handshake messages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within radio range of the affected devices (access point and client).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker must be able to establish a man-in-the-middle position between the AP and client, capable of manipulating the timing and transmission of messages.
    *   **Knowledge of TDLS:** The attacker must be able to target the TDLS handshake.

**Additional Information:**
* Some content confirms that RHEL 6 isn't affected, as it doesn't support TDLS, while RHEL 7 is affected.
*  wpa\_supplicant versions prior to 2.6 are vulnerable while 2.6 and newer versions have included fixes for this issue.
*  The vulnerability is part of the KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) family.
*  The vulnerability has been addressed in various vendor products.

**Additional details from specific content:**

*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Provides detailed information from the bug report. It also notes that  RHEL7 has a patch to prevent TPK M2 retransmission, but still leaves the theoretical possibility of an attack with the M3 message. Red Hat errata confirms fix availability for RHEL 7 via RHSA-2017:2907.
*   **CERT@VDE Advisory:** Lists Pepperl+Fuchs/ecom instruments products affected and links CVE-2017-13086 to the possibility of replay, decrypt and spoof frames, requiring an attacker to be significantly closer to the ecom device than to the access point.
*   **Ubuntu Security Notice:** Lists CVE-2017-13086 among other vulnerabilities fixed in a wpa\_supplicant and hostapd update and provides package version information for Ubuntu 17.04, 16.04, and 14.04.
*   **Siemens Advisory:** Mentions the vulnerability (among others) as part of the "KRACK Attacks" and lists several affected industrial products with their corresponding fixes, also noting that  devices using WPA2-CCMP are only subject to traffic decryption and replay and not to packet injection or key retrieval and also states that some devices are not vulnerable to the attack in their default configuration.
*   **w1.fi:** Shows a commit "TDLS: Ignore incoming TDLS Setup Response retries" which is part of the fix.
*   **krackattacks.com:** This website extensively explains KRACK attacks. Regarding TDLS, it says "wpa\_supplicant implementation is already rejecting TPK M2 retries, so the reconfiguration issue cannot apply for it. For TPK M3, there is a theoretical impact. However, if that frame is replayed, the current wpa\_supplicant implementation ends up tearing down the TDLS link immediately and as such, there is no real window for performing the attack."
*   **Red Hat Security Pages:** Provides general information on severity ratings and Red Hat's security practices, as well as specific information about the KRACK vulnerabilities, including that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are not affected by this CVE.
*   **Android Security Bulletin:** Lists this CVE as an EoP (Elevation of Privilege) vulnerability related to reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey.
*   **Red Hat Access:**  Explains wpa\_supplicant vulnerabilities and mentions that RH 6 is not affected because it doesn't support TDLS. It also contains a detection script.
*   **Gentoo Security Advisory:** Details the fix required for the vulnerability in hostapd and wpa\_supplicant.
*   **w1.fi /security page:** Shows commits related to preventing the vulnerabilities.
*   **Cisco Security Advisory:**  Lists CVE-2017-13086 as one of multiple vulnerabilities in WPA/WPA2.
*   **CERT Vulnerability Note:** Provides an overview, description, impact and a solution.

**3. Conclusion:**

The provided documents offer relevant information regarding CVE-2017-13086, detailing its root cause, the vulnerable component, its impact, and how to address it. Specifically it provides insight into:
