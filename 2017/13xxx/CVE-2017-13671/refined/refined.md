The provided content is related to CVE-2017-13671.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `CommandHelper.php` processes user-provided comments.  It uses a custom tag parser that has vulnerabilities that can be exploited through crafted input. The original code used regular expressions to replace specific tags. The fix introduces a new tag parser to correctly parse the tag pairs, pre-construct the replacement items, and sanitize the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a potential persistent XSS vulnerability. The old parser was susceptible to injecting malicious code through comment tags.
- **Malformed URLs:** When processing URLs in comment tags (event, thread, link), the old code didn't properly validate the URL or the data contained within the tag, leading to potential issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Persistent XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a comment. This would execute whenever another user views the comment, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious comment containing specific tags that, when rendered by the vulnerable parser, would inject JavaScript or other malicious content into the HTML of the page.
- This exploit requires the ability to add comments to the MISP instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create comments in the MISP application.
