{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to the encryption of synthetic passwords. Synthetic passwords are encrypted using both a random auth-bound keymaster key and a secret derived from the user's password. The encryption order was incorrect, leading to potential password verification oracle issues without rate limiting.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect order of encryption for synthetic passwords"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a password verification oracle, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass password protection.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the password verification process.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the password verification process."
