  "CVE-2017-13078": {
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability in the processing of the 802.11i 4-way handshake messages of the WPA and WPA2 protocols that can allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to force a supplicant to reinstall a previously used group key.",

      "Incorrect handling of 802.11i 4-way handshake messages",
      "Reinstallation of previously used group key"

    "Impact": "An attacker within radio range can force a supplicant to reinstall a previously used group key, allowing replay of frames from access points to clients.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle position between supplicant and authenticator",
      "Retransmitting previously used messages exchanges between supplicant and authenticator"
    ],
