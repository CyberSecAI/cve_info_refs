**CVE-2017-13269**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the Bluetooth component of the Android system. Specifically, there's an issue with how the system handles received frame types in the Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP).

*  **Vulnerability:** An information disclosure vulnerability exists. The vulnerability appears to be caused by a failure to properly validate the received frame type within BNEP.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information due to the improper handling of frame types. The severity is rated as "Moderate."

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Bluetooth interface. This would likely involve sending specially crafted Bluetooth packets to the vulnerable device.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be within Bluetooth range of a vulnerable device and have the ability to send Bluetooth packets.

*   **Additional Details:**
    * The fix for this vulnerability involves checking the received frame type.
    * The affected Android versions include 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0 and 8.1.
    * The AOSP commit addressing this issue is: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/ae12fc48fa6c7a114234afa055ab1cd630d6da8d](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/%2B/ae12fc48fa6c7a114234afa055ab1cd630d6da8d)
