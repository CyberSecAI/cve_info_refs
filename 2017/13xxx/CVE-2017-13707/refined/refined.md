The provided content describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Replibit Backup Manager, and is relevant to CVE-2017-13707.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of a restricted "replibit" user to execute the `vi` text editor with `sudo` privileges. While attempts to directly edit critical system files or execute shell commands within vi are blocked, the user can exploit vi's built-in file navigation capabilities to bypass these restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The sudo configuration allows the "replibit" user to run `vi` as root.
- vi allows navigating the file system when opened with a directory target (`sudo vi ~`).
- Insufficient restrictions within the `vi` editor enabled the user to navigate to sensitive system directories, such as `/etc`.
- Insufficient checks on the files accessible when `vi` is invoked with `sudo`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local user with restricted shell access can escalate privileges to root.
- Attackers can modify sensitive system files, including `/etc/passwd`, granting themselves full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- An attacker would need initial access to the system as the "replibit" user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on the target system with access to the restricted "replibit" shell.
- The default password for the "replibit" account is known, which simplifies exploitation.
- No other special capabilities are needed.

The content also provides a step-by-step exploitation process which involves using `sudo vi ~` to open vi, then navigating up the directory tree to `/etc`, editing the `/etc/passwd` file to give the user root privileges, and then logging out and logging back in.
