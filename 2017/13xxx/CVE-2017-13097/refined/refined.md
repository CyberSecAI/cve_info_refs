The content is related to CVE-2017-13097.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify the Rights Block of a digital envelope, which is part of the P1735 standard. The Rights Block contains the encrypted AES key as well as access control and license requirements. An attacker can modify this block.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of the Rights Block within the P1735 standard. Specifically, it allows modification of the block to remove or relax license requirements.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can modify the Rights Block to remove or relax license requirements specified by the original IP owner. This allows for unauthorized use of the IP.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves modifying the Rights Block of the encrypted IP. This is achieved by selecting a new AES key and spoofing a new Rights Block.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs information about the IP to craft a modified Rights Block.
