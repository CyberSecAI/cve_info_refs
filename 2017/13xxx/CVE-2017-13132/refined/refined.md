Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13132:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The Gentoo Security Advisory explicitly lists CVE-2017-13132 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in their update for ImageMagick.
*   The GitHub issue #674 also relates to a vulnerability that causes an assertion failure in `WriteBlobStream` leading to a denial-of-service, which is consistent with the multiple vulnerabilities being addressed by the advisory.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is located in the `WriteBlobStream` function within `MagickCore/blob.c`.
* It involves a failed assertion: `image->blob->type != UndefinedStream`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The core weakness lies in the improper handling of image blobs, specifically when the blob type is `UndefinedStream`, causing the assertion to fail.
*   This leads to a crash of the application, resulting in a denial of service.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the assertion failure, causing ImageMagick to crash and become unavailable for processing further requests.
* The Gentoo advisory mentions "other unspecified impacts", suggesting there may be additional potential consequences.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted File:** The primary attack vector involves providing a specially crafted image file to ImageMagick.
*   The GitHub issue provides a test case link, demonstrating the specific file format capable of triggering the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attacker:** The Gentoo advisory indicates that a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing a user to process the crafted file.
*   The attacker does not need to be local, implying the vulnerability can be triggered by processing an image file from a remote source or over a network.
*   The attacker requires the ability to make the vulnerable ImageMagick instance process their malformed file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The GitHub issue provides a code snippet showing the assertion failure output: `Assertion 'image->blob->type != UndefinedStream' failed.` This confirms the root cause is directly related to the blob type.
*   The Gentoo advisory provides a list of CVEs, and the Github issue confirms that the assertion failure is related to the vulnerabilities in the advisory.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-13132 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in ImageMagick that occurs due to an assertion failure in the `WriteBlobStream` function when processing a crafted image file with an undefined stream type. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a malicious image file that causes the application to crash.
