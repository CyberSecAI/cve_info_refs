{
  "vulnerability_id": "CVE-2017-13215",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an issue in the `skcipher_recvmsg` function of the Linux kernel's skcipher component. Specifically, it's related to how the kernel handles the transmission scatter-gather list (TSGL) and receives data, leading to a privilege escalation.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Privilege escalation due to improper handling of TX scatter-gather list"
  ],
  "impact": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges within the system.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Local exploitation via a crafted input to the `skcipher_recvmsg` function."
   ],
  "required_capabilities": "A local unprivileged user is needed to exploit the vulnerability."
