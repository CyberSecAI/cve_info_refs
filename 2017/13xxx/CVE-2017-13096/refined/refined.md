- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The P1735 IEEE standard, used for encrypting electronic-design intellectual property (IP) and managing access rights, has flaws that allow modification of the Rights Block to remove or relax access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the ability to modify the Rights Block, specifically the Key Block (encryption of the AES key under RSA public key of the EDA tool provider). An attacker can select a new AES key and create a new Rights Block that modifies or removes the original access control or licensing requirements specified by the IP owner.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass access control and licensing restrictions on electronic design IPs, potentially leading to unauthorized use or modification of IP.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack involves modifying the Rights Block of the digital envelope, which contains the Key Block as well as access control and license requirements.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have some information about the IP and the ability to craft a new, valid Rights Block, which might involve selecting a new AES key and constructing the necessary structure for the EDA tool to accept it.
