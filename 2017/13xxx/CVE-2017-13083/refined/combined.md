## Akeo Consulting Rufus fails to update itself securely

#### Vulnerability Note VU#403768

Original Release Date: 2017-08-29 | Last Revised: 2017-08-31

---

### Overview

Akeo Consulting Rufus fails to securely check for and retrieve updates, which an allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Akeo Consulting Rufus 2.16 retrieves updates over HTTP. While Rufus does attempt to perform some basic signature checking of downloaded updates, it does not ensure that the update was signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). This lack of CA checking allows the use of a self-signed certificate. Because of these two weaknesses, an attacker can subvert the update process to achieve arbitrary code execution. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the same network as, or who can otherwise affect network traffic from, a Rufus user can cause the Rufus update process to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is [addressed](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/c3c39f7f8a11f612c4ebf7affce25ec6928eb1cb) in Rufus 2.17.1187. Please also consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Don't use built-in update capabilities**Because Rufus does not include the ability to securely install updates, any Rufus updates should be obtained from <https://rufus.akeo.ie/> directly, using your web browser.**Avoid untrusted networks**Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack. |

### Vendor Information

You do realize that the executable is digitally signed, in which case the matter in which it was download does not matter, do you?

I would encourage you to further your knowledge of security practices, because, just because something says "secure" in its name, it doesn't mean that it is actually secure (the transmission of data is "secured", but if the source download is compromised, which is something that's fairly easy to achieve if you physically threaten the person administering the server, downloading through SSL won't bring you any "security"), or just because something does not say "secure", it doesn't mean that it is insecure if it is digitally signed. Likewise, people tend to believe that self signed certificates are more insecure that the ones issued by Certification Authority, but there are occasions where they are actually safer. I've been dealing with PKI matters for more than 15 years, and written quite a few applications that revolve around it, so I hope that, rather than jumping to the conclusion that experienced developers don't know what they are doing, you will actually take the approach that, maybe, they have greater knowledge than you do about security matters, and, because of it, they can make educated decisions about discarding security practices that are entirely redundant and aren't bringing anything to the equation. You may also want to read the second part of what I wrote [here](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/issues/1005#issuecomment-323877656) when I was recently questioned about the same subject.

As a matter of fact, the next version of Rufus will switch the update check (and other downloads) back to http rather than https ([8b094e8](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/8b094e840b8e630ff6692381eafc4d286df7ba22#issuecomment-325415199)), because, due to the way Rufus is designed, using http does not make our downloads any less "safe", even if the NSA or whatever 3-letter security agency has control of the connection and attempts to inject malicious content into it.

Now, provided you spend time reading and understanding the topics being discussed on [our page about Security in Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Security#issuecomment-325415199) and especially [this part](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Security#Hash_DB_table_mitigation), I'll be happy to debunk any scenario you can propose, where you think the use of HTTP in Rufus is going to make its users less secure than if HTTPS was used.

* This commit effectively fixes <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/403768> ([CVE-2017-13083](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rmwh-8jrh-hc23 "CVE-2017-13083")) as
  it is described per its revision 11, which is the latest revision at the time of this commit,
  by disabling Windows prompts, enacted during signature validation, that allow the user to
  bypass the intended signature verification checks.
* It needs to be pointed out that the vulnerability ("allow(ing) the use of a self-signed
  certificate"), which relies on the end-user actively ignoring a Windows prompt that tells
  them that the update failed the signature validation whilst also advising against running it,
  is being fully addressed, even as the update protocol remains HTTP.
* It also need to be pointed out that the extended delay (48 hours) between the time the
  vulnerability was reported and the moment it is fixed in our codebase has to do with
  the fact that the reporter chose to deviate from standard security practices by not
  disclosing the details of the vulnerability with us, be it publicly or privately,
  before creating the cert.org report. The only advance notification we received was a
  generic note about the use of HTTP vs HTTPS, which, as have established, is not
  immediately relevant to addressing the reported vulnerability.
* Closes [#1009](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/issues/1009)
* Note: The other vulnerability scenario described towards the end of [#1009](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/issues/1009), which
  doesn't have to do with the "lack of CA checking", will be addressed separately.

## Akeo Consulting Rufus fails to update itself securely

#### Vulnerability Note VU#403768

Original Release Date: 2017-08-29 | Last Revised: 2017-08-31

---

### Overview

Akeo Consulting Rufus fails to securely check for and retrieve updates, which an allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Akeo Consulting Rufus 2.16 retrieves updates over HTTP. While Rufus does attempt to perform some basic signature checking of downloaded updates, it does not ensure that the update was signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). This lack of CA checking allows the use of a self-signed certificate. Because of these two weaknesses, an attacker can subvert the update process to achieve arbitrary code execution. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the same network as, or who can otherwise affect network traffic from, a Rufus user can cause the Rufus update process to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is [addressed](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/c3c39f7f8a11f612c4ebf7affce25ec6928eb1cb) in Rufus 2.17.1187. Please also consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Don't use built-in update capabilities**Because Rufus does not include the ability to securely install updates, any Rufus updates should be obtained from <https://rufus.akeo.ie/> directly, using your web browser.**Avoid untrusted networks**Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack. |

### Vendor Information

You do realize that the executable is digitally signed, in which case the matter in which it was download does not matter, do you?

I would encourage you to further your knowledge of security practices, because, just because something says "secure" in its name, it doesn't mean that it is actually secure (the transmission of data is "secured", but if the source download is compromised, which is something that's fairly easy to achieve if you physically threaten the person administering the server, downloading through SSL won't bring you any "security"), or just because something does not say "secure", it doesn't mean that it is insecure if it is digitally signed. Likewise, people tend to believe that self signed certificates are more insecure that the ones issued by Certification Authority, but there are occasions where they are actually safer. I've been dealing with PKI matters for more than 15 years, and written quite a few applications that revolve around it, so I hope that, rather than jumping to the conclusion that experienced developers don't know what they are doing, you will actually take the approach that, maybe, they have greater knowledge than you do about security matters, and, because of it, they can make educated decisions about discarding security practices that are entirely redundant and aren't bringing anything to the equation. You may also want to read the second part of what I wrote [here](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/issues/1005#issuecomment-323877656) when I was recently questioned about the same subject.

As a matter of fact, the next version of Rufus will switch the update check (and other downloads) back to http rather than https ([8b094e8](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/8b094e840b8e630ff6692381eafc4d286df7ba22#issuecomment-325415199)), because, due to the way Rufus is designed, using http does not make our downloads any less "safe", even if the NSA or whatever 3-letter security agency has control of the connection and attempts to inject malicious content into it.

Now, provided you spend time reading and understanding the topics being discussed on [our page about Security in Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Security#issuecomment-325415199) and especially [this part](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/Security#Hash_DB_table_mitigation), I'll be happy to debunk any scenario you can propose, where you think the use of HTTP in Rufus is going to make its users less secure than if HTTPS was used.
