Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13083:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Akeo Consulting Rufus retrieves updates over HTTP, which is an insecure protocol. While Rufus attempts to perform signature checking on downloaded updates, it doesn't verify if the update was signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). This lack of CA checking allows the use of self-signed certificates, effectively bypassing the intended security checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Insecure update channel:** The use of HTTP for downloading updates exposes the process to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
2.  **Lack of CA verification:** The failure to validate the update's signature against a trusted CA allows attackers to use self-signed certificates, enabling them to replace legitimate updates with malicious ones.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's system. By subverting the update process, the attacker can force Rufus to download and execute a malicious executable.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. An attacker needs to be on the same network as the Rufus user or be able to intercept and modify network traffic from the user's machine to the update server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **Network proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the victim or have the ability to intercept and modify network traffic.
2.  **MITM capability:** The attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
3.  **Malicious payload:** The attacker needs to have a malicious executable that can be used to replace a legitimate update of Rufus.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vendor initially argued that because the executable is signed, the download method doesn't matter. However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the signature is not validated against a trusted CA.
*   The vendor initially did not agree that using HTTP was an issue.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.17.1187 by disabling the Windows prompts during signature validation, which could allow a user to bypass the intended checks.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is rated as High with a base score of 5.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) and 8.1 from github advisory database (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
