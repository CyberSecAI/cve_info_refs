  "CVE-2017-13012": {
    "description": "The ICMP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-icmp.c:icmp_print().",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check in the ICMP parser when handling included IPv4 packets. Specifically, the code fetches the length of the included packet's IPv4 header without verifying if the data is within the bounds of the captured packet, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read",
      "Missing bounds check"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the tcpdump process if crafted packets are processed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted ICMP packet to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump.",
    "additional_details": "The fix involves adding a bounds check before fetching the length from the included packet's IPv4 header. This prevents reading beyond the allocated buffer."
