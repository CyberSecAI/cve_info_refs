- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An inconsistent user interface issue in Mail
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The issue arises when handling S/MIME encrypted emails. If the recipient's S/MIME certificate is not installed, the email may be inadvertently sent unencrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A S/MIME encrypted email may be unintentionally sent unencrypted.
