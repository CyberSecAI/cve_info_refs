Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-13735:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A floating point exception occurs in the `LibRaw::kodak_radc_load_raw` function within the `dcraw_common.cpp` file of the libRAW library. This is due to a division by zero error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero: The code attempts a division operation where the divisor `mul[c]` can be zero, leading to a floating-point exception. Specifically, the line `val = (buf[c][y+1][x] << 4) / mul[c];` is the source of the error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The floating-point exception causes the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted input: The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted input file (`POC1`) that, when processed by the `multirender_test` tool using the vulnerable libRAW library, results in the division by zero.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a specially crafted input file: The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious input file that triggers the division by zero in the libRAW library. This could potentially be achieved via a vulnerable application that uses libRAW to process user supplied image files.

**Additional details:**
- The provided bug report confirms that the issue is a floating point exception and the vulnerability occurs in the  `LibRaw::kodak_radc_load_raw` function at line 2751 in `internal/dcraw_common.cpp`.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) file called "POC1" was provided to reproduce the issue.
- The vulnerability was fixed upstream in libraw version 0.18.3
