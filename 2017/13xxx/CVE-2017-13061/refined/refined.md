Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from ImageMagick's incorrect handling of malformed image files, specifically related to memory allocation during processing of PSD files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Exhaustion:** A specially crafted image file can cause excessive memory allocation when processed by ImageMagick, potentially leading to denial of service. The `string_info->length` can be controlled by the input file, leading to an attempt to allocate memory which exceeds system resources.
- **Missing or Incomplete Input Sanitizing**: The provided information indicates that lack of sanitization of the input file allowed the attacker to control the memory allocation size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the excessive memory allocation, an attacker can cause the ImageMagick process to consume all available memory, leading to a crash or system instability.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed, the Ubuntu notice mentions the possibility of code execution, which is a severe impact. This is due to memory corruption or other undefined behaviors caused by incorrect memory allocation. The Debian advisory also hints at potential arbitrary code execution when malformed images are processed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Image Files:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or an automated system into processing a malicious image file. This can happen through various means like:
   - Email attachments
   - Web uploads/downloads
   - File sharing
- **File Format:** The specific issue mentioned is with the processing of PSD image files, implying this is where the vulnerability exists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted image to an ImageMagick process. This means the attacker might need to:
   - Socially engineer a user into processing an image
   - Control an input that ImageMagick is processing in an automated process.
   - Exploit a different vulnerability to be able to write a file which is then processed by ImageMagick.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Gentoo Security Advisory explicitly states "Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in ImageMagick, the worst of which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition." and references CVE-2017-13061.
- The Github issue report provides details on how a specific PSD file can trigger the memory exhaustion.
- The vulnerability is related to the `ReadPSDImage` function and specifically the memory allocation within the function.
- Multiple advisories reference the same set of CVEs, indicating the wide spread impact of these vulnerabilities on different distributions.
