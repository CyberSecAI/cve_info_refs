Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an asymmetry between the `writeToParcel` and `readFromParcel` methods of the `DcParamObject`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Asymmetric Parceling:** The core issue is that the writing and reading of data to and from the Parcel object are not symmetrical. This discrepancy could lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior when a `DcParamObject` is serialized and deserialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability is classified as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP). This suggests that exploiting the asymmetric parceling can allow a malicious application to gain access to permissions or resources they would otherwise not have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** A local application, specifically crafted to exploit the `DcParamObject`'s asymmetric parceling, is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit message indicates that the fix addresses a "Security Vulnerability of DcParamObject" by ensuring symmetry between `writeToParcel` and `readFromParcel`.
- The CVE is part of the Android Security Bulletin for May 2018, with the fix included in the 2018-05-01 security patch level.
