{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The synthetic password was being doubly encrypted using a random auth-bound keymaster key and a secret derived from the user's password. The order of encryption was incorrect, which could potentially lead to verification oracle without rate limiting.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect encryption order of the synthetic password"
    ],
    "impact": "Password verification oracle without rate limiting.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker could potentially exploit the incorrect encryption order to bypass password verification without rate limiting"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the password verification process to exploit this vulnerability."
