  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The BGP parser in tcpdump has a buffer over-read vulnerability in the print-bgp.c:bgp_attr_print() function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-125"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a denial of service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "No special capabilities or privileges are required. An attacker only needs to send crafted network packets.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability is located in the function that parses and prints BGP attributes related to PMSI tunnels. The fix involves correcting a bounds check within the `bgp_attr_print()` function. The commit introducing the fix, d10a0f980fe8f9407ab1ffbd612641433ebe175e, shows the exact line changed and includes a test using a capture file with the malformed BGP attribute. The updated version is 4.9.2."
