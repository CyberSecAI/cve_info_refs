- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in the handling of DMA. Specifically, FileVault decryption buffers were DMA mapped for too long.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate handling of DMA leading to potential access to unencrypted filesystem data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious Thunderbolt adapter can recover unencrypted APFS filesystem data.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious Thunderbolt adapter is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access and control over a malicious Thunderbolt adapter.
