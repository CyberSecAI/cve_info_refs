Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13089:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content confirms that the vulnerability described aligns with CVE-2017-13089. The core issue is a stack-based buffer overflow in the HTTP protocol handling within `wget`, specifically related to processing chunked encoded HTTP responses.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The `skip_short_body()` function in `http.c` is vulnerable. This function is used when `wget` encounters a chunked transfer encoding and the content body is not as long as expected (such as redirect responses).
*   The vulnerability arises because `wget` does not check if the chunk size read by `strtol()` is non-negative. If a negative chunk size is provided, a subsequent call to `fd_read()` with this value will lead to a buffer overflow.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** When a negative chunk size is passed to `fd_read()`, the function attempts to read a large amount of data into a smaller stack buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow. This overflow can overwrite critical stack data (e.g., return addresses), leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary flaw is the absence of validation of the chunk size before it is passed to `fd_read()`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker, by enticing a user to connect to a malicious server sending specially crafted chunked responses, could potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*  **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can cause a denial of service by crashing the application due to the overflow or other undefined behaviors.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by setting up a malicious HTTP server that sends specially crafted responses to `wget` clients.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to use `wget` to connect to this malicious server.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to set up an HTTP server and have the victim's `wget` client connect to it.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  No user credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Malicious Server:** The attacker requires control over a malicious server that can serve a crafted chunked response to trigger the vulnerability in `wget`.

**Additional Technical Details (from extracted content):**

*   **Affected Function:** The vulnerability resides within `http.c:skip_short_body()` and impacts `connect.c:fd_read()` due to the lack of validation on the chunk size.
*   **Chunked Encoding:** The exploitation involves specifically crafted HTTP responses using chunked transfer encoding.
*  **Data Type Mismatch:** The vulnerability is triggered because `strtol()` returns a signed `long int`, and the negative value isn't validated before it is passed as an `int` argument to fd_read(), discarding higher order bits.
*  **Patch:** Upstream patch involves adding a negative check on the chunk size read in the `skip_short_body` function.
