{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The L2TP parser in tcpdump has a buffer over-read vulnerability in the handling of Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs). Specifically, the code didn't check if the AVP's content exceeded the AVP's declared length before accessing the content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted L2TP packet with an AVP that has a length greater than what's expected.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network - The attacker sends a malicious L2TP packet over the network to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to craft and send network packets, specifically L2TP packets with a manipulated AVP length.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located in print-l2tp.c, in several functions which are responsible for parsing L2TP packets. The fix involves checking that the AVP length is large enough for all the required data in the AVP. Apple also lists this CVE in their security update."
