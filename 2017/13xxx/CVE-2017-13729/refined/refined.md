Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `_nc_save_str` function within the `alloc_entry.c` file of the ncurses library. Specifically, the issue occurs when processing terminal capability strings during the parsing of terminfo data using `tic` utility.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Illegal Address Access:** The `_nc_save_str` function attempts to access memory at an invalid address (0xffffffffffffffff). This leads to a segmentation fault.
- **Malformed/Crafted Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted terminfo entry, specifically when processing the 'll' capability string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash (segmentation fault) of the `tic` utility. This leads to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the Gentoo advisory notes the potential for arbitrary code execution for some of the ncurses vulnerabilities. It is likely that this vulnerability, in a different context or with further exploitation, could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, though no details on how are provided in the given documents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Processing Malicious Terminfo Data:** The attack vector involves enticing a user to process malicious terminfo data using the `tic` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide or trick a user into processing the malicious terminfo entry (e.g., via a crafted terminfo file).

**Technical Details:**
The provided Red Hat bug report details a specific scenario using the `tic` utility and a crafted `POC8` file that causes a segmentation fault:
1. The `tic` utility processes the malicious terminfo entry, leading to the `_nc_save_str` function.
2. Inside `_nc_save_str`, `strlen()` attempts to access memory at address `0xffffffffffffffff`, resulting in a crash.
3. The root cause of the invalid memory access is that the `string` parameter passed into the function is an invalid pointer.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is related to a set of other ncurses vulnerabilities addressed in the GLSA 201804-13.
- The Red Hat bug report indicates that this bug is a duplicate of bug 1488916.

In summary, CVE-2017-13729 is caused by an illegal memory access in the `_nc_save_str` function when parsing malformed terminfo entries in `tic`, leading to a denial-of-service. A specially crafted terminfo file is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
