Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13672:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `vga_draw_text` function of the QEMU VGA display emulator. When updating the display, QEMU might read data beyond the allocated video memory area.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Out-of-bounds read in the VGA display update logic.
- Incorrect bounds checking during display update operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** A privileged user within the guest operating system can trigger the vulnerability, leading to a crash of the QEMU process on the host. This results in a denial-of-service condition for the virtualized environment.
- **Information Disclosure:** There's a potential to read out of bounds memory contents through the vulnerability, but the main concern is DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** A privileged user or process within a virtualized guest OS triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker requires a privileged account or process inside a virtualized guest OS.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable display update operation by manipulating graphics configurations or triggering specific events within the guest OS.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability specifically affects QEMU when built with VGA display emulation support.
- Patches involve correcting how QEMU accesses VGA memory to prevent out-of-bounds reads.
