Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13149:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by a missing allocation of extra bytes for a bits buffer within the `libhevc` library. When a nal fills the entire bits buffer, it leads to an out-of-bounds memory read access during parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the code attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition due to the out-of-bounds memory access, which could crash the affected service or the entire device.
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** This is also listed as an information disclosure vulnerability. It is likely a byproduct of the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted media files that use the HEVC codec. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by providing malicious media content to an application that uses the vulnerable `libhevc` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HEVC media file to a vulnerable application. The specific capabilities are not listed in this provided content.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability exists in the `libhevc` library within the Android media framework.
-   The fix involves allocating extra bytes for the bits buffer to prevent the out-of-bounds read.
-   The vulnerability affects Android versions 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, and 8.0.
