Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read within the `iso9660_proc_dir()` function located in `tsk/fs/iso9660_dent.c`.
- This occurs when processing a crafted ISO 9660 image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The software attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and crash of the `fls` tool. This prevents the tool from functioning correctly when processing a crafted ISO 9660 image.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted ISO 9660 image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted ISO 9660 image to the vulnerable software (Sleuth Kit's `fls` tool). No special position or privileges are required beyond the ability to supply this file as input to the tool.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and the input files are sourced from files.fuzzing-project.org.
- A backtrace is provided, showing the call stack that leads to the segmentation fault in the `iso9660_proc_dir` function.
- The affected version of Sleuth Kit is 4.4.0-5 (prior to the patch in 4.4.0-5+deb9u1).
- The `fls` tool is used to list files and directories from disk images.

In summary, CVE-2017-13755 describes an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Sleuth Kit's `fls` tool when processing a crafted ISO 9660 image, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
