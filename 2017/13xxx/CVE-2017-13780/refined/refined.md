- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `download.php` script uses an unfiltered `$_GET["file"]` parameter to construct a file path for download.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary File Download vulnerability. The script does not sanitize or validate the `$_GET["file"]` input, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive configuration files, source code, or other data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `download.php` with a `file` parameter containing a path to a target file. For example: `https://localhost/module/admin_conf/download.php?file=../../etc/passwd`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required.
