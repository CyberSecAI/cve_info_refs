  "Root cause": "An error skip was not properly handled during processing of 8x8 push CTBs (Coding Tree Blocks) in libhevc.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper handling of error skip during processing of 8x8 push CTBs"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). The specific impact is not detailed, but the severity is listed as moderate.",
   "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) video stream that triggers the error skip in a specific way.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to provide a specially crafted HEVC video stream that causes an error when processing 8x8 push CTBs."
