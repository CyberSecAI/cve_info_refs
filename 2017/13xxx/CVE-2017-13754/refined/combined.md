Product: CodeMeter & Control Panel - WebAdmin (Web-Application) 6.50.2624.500
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
Severity Level:
===============
Low
Technical Details & Description:
================================
A cross site and input validation issue has been discovered in the Wibu Systems AG CodeMeter WebAdmin v6.50 web-server web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code with client-side vector to the vulnerable function or module to
followup with a compromising attack.
The input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the `server name` input field of the `advanced settings - time server` module.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the client-side. First the attacker injects the payload and after
it the POST request is performed to save the content permanently as regedit db entry.
The basic validation in the application is well setup but in case of the advanced settings the validation parameter are still not implemented
to secure the function at all. The vulnerability is a classic filter input validation vulnerability. The application has no cookies and therefore
the attack risk is more minor but not that less then to ignore it. The vulnerable files are `ChangeConfiguration.html`, `time\_server\_list.html`
and `certified\_time.html`. The `ChangeConfiguration.html` is marked as injection point for the payload. The `time\_server\_list.html` and
`certified\_time.html` files are marked as the execution point of the issue.
The security issue was uncovered during the blurrybox hacking contest of the wibu systems ag and acknowledged by the internal management.
The security risk of the cross site issue and input validation bug is estimated as low with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 2.8.
Exploitation of the cross site issue and input validation web vulnerability requires medium user interaction and a privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in phishing attacks, external redirects to malicious sources and manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Advanced Settings - Time Server
Vulnerable File(s):
[+] ChangeConfiguration.html
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] server name
Affected Module(s):
[+] time\_server\_list.html
[+] certified\_time.html
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The input validation issue can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account and with medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Start the CodeMeter software
2. Open the webadmin gui
3. Move to advanced settings
4. Open the time-server module
5. Click the plus to add a new time server
Note: The request method is POST
6. Inject a test script code payload with matching domain and save via POST
7. The code is saved and executes of the dbms in the time-server list module index
8. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!
Note: The method can be automated by usage of post method requester to include a payload.

2. Parse the input field and escape the content in the application itself
3. Parse in the visible listing the output location of the time-server items
4. Setup a secure exception-handling to handle illegal events
5. Include a proper validation mask to the form and to prevent further injection attacks
The security vulnerability has been patched in the version 6.50b by the wibu systems ag.
The wibu systems ag resolved th issue fast and acknowledged the researcher.
Security Risk:
==============
The seurity risk of the xss issue and input validation web vulnerability in the web-server webadmin web-application is estimated as medium (CVSS 2.8).
Earlier version releases up to codemeter 6.50 may be affected as well by the cross site scripting issue.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Remote

Severity Level:
===============
Medium

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the Wibu Systems AG CodeMeter WebAdmin v6.50
web-server web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code with application-side vector to the
vulnerable function or
module to followup with a compromising attack.

The input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the `server name` input field of the `advanced settings -
time server` module.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side. First the attacker
injects the payload and
after it the POST request is performed to save the content permanently. After that the issue triggers on each visit an
execution. The basic
validation in the application is well setup but in case of the advanced settings the validation parameter are still not
implemented to secure
the function at all. The vulnerability is a classic filter input validation vulnerability. The application has no
cookies and therefore the
attack risk is more minor but not that less then to ignore it. The vulnerable files are `ChangeConfiguration.html`,
`time_server_list.html`
and `certified_time.html`. The `ChangeConfiguration.html` is marked as injection point for the payload. The
`time_server_list.html` and
`certified_time.html` files are mared with the execution point of the issue.

The security issue was uncovered during the blurrybox hacking contest of the wibu systems ag and acknowledged by the
management.

The security risk of the persistent input validation issue is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 3.5.
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a privileged
web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to
malicious sources and
persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Advanced Settings - Time Server

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] ChangeConfiguration.html

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] server name

Affected Module(s):
[+] time_server_list.html
[+] certified_time.html

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account and
with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to
continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Start the CodeMeter software
2. Open the webadmin gui
3. Move to advanced settings
4. Open the time-server module
5. Click the plus to add a new time server
Note: The request method is POST
6. Inject a test script code payload with matching domain and save via POST
7. The code is saved and executes of the dbms in the time-server list module index
8. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!

Note: The method can be automated by usage of post method requester to include a payload.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Restrict the input field and disallow the usage of special chars like in the other input fields
2. Parse the input field and escape the content
3. Parse in the visible listing the output location of the item
4. Setup a secure exception-handling to handl illegal events
5. Include a proper validation mask to the form to prevent further injection attacks

The security vulnerability has been patched in the version 6.50b.

Security Risk:
==============
The seurity risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability in the web-server webadmin web-application is
estimated as medium (CVSS 3.5).
Earlier version releases up to codemeter 6.50 may be affected as well by the cross site scripting web vulnerability.

### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### 4.2.1 [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

A Cross-Site Scripting (“XSS”) vulnerability was found in certain versions of Wibu-Systems CodeMeter that may allow local attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a specific field in a configuration file, allowing an attacker to access sensitive information, or even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

[CVE-2017-13754](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-13754) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 2.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)).

### 4.2.2 [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

A custom string copying function of the license server manager in FlexNet Publisher does not use proper bounds checking on incoming data, allowing a remote, unauthenticated user to send crafted messages with the intent of causing a buffer overflow.

[CVE-2015-8277](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8277) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 4.3 BACKGROUND

* **Critical Infrastructure Sectors:** Chemical, Critical Manufacturing, Food and Agriculture, Water and Wastewater Systems
* **Countries/Areas Deployed:** Worldwide
* **Company Headquarters Location:** U.S.

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Rockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation recommends users with affected versions of CodeMeter and/or FlexNet Publisher that were installed with FactoryTalk Activation Manager to update Factory Talk Activation Manager to v4.02. If unable to update FactoryTalk Activation Manager to v4.02, update CodeMeter to a compatible version of CodeMeter that is compatible with FactoryTalk Activation Manager.

Rockwell Automation also encourages users to combine the updates above with these general security guidelines to employ multiple strategies simultaneously.

* Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by blocking or restricting access to Port 2222/TCP and UDP and Port 44818/TCP and UDP, using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation Products, see Knowledgebase Article ID 898270 available at: https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a\_id/898270/page/1 (Login required).
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

**--------- Begin Update B Part 1 of 1 --------**

For more information about these vulnerabilities and the recommended mitigations, please see Rockwell Automation Knowledgebase Advisory 1073133 available at:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073133> (Login required)

**--------- End Update B Part 1 of 1 --------**

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
