Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-13186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect use of `mmco` parameters within the decoder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   Incorrect handling of `mmco` parameters during decoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   The provided information does not explicitly mention the impact, however the Pixel/Nexus Security Bulletin entry for CVE-2017-13186 labels the impact as "DoS High" for affected versions of Android 6.0 and 6.0.1 and "NSI" (Non-specified impact) for later Android versions. This suggests that a malformed video could lead to denial of service.
-   The commit message related to the fix indicates that an extra structure was added to read `mmco` values and copy them only once per picture, which implies this is related to a memory safety issue.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack vector involves processing a crafted media file (likely an AVC/H.264 video) containing malformed `mmco` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malformed media file to the vulnerable system to trigger the vulnerability. This could potentially happen through various means, such as:
    -   A malicious website that serves the crafted media file.
    -   A malicious application that handles media files.
    -   A media file sent via messaging or other file-sharing methods.
    
**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved adding extra structure to read `mmco` values and copy only once per picture, suggesting the issue might be related to redundant copying or memory management related to these parameters.
- The vulnerability affects the `libavc` library, which is part of the Android media framework.
