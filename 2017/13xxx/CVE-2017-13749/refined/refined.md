  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A reachable assertion abort in the `jpc_pi_nextrpcl()` function within JasPer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Assertion failure due to incorrect calculation or handling of parameters related to processing regions within a JPEG2000 image."

      "Crafting a malicious JPEG2000 image that triggers the assertion failure during processing with the `imginfo` tool (or other JasPer tools/libraries)."

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JPEG2000 image to a vulnerable application using the JasPer library.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted image file using the `imginfo` tool. The assertion failure occurs in the `jpc_pi_nextrpcl` function, specifically when `pi->prcno` is not less than `pi->pirlvl->numprcs`."
