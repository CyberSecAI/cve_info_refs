Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13266:

**CVE-2017-13266**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the Bluetooth system component. The provided commit message "AVRCP: Check the number of text attributes requested" suggests that the issue involves a lack of proper validation or checking of the number of text attributes requested by an attacker using the Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) of Bluetooth.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of the number of requested text attributes within the Bluetooth stack while handling AVRCP commands. This could be caused by an integer overflow or an out-of-bounds access when processing the number of requested text attributes.
    
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  A successful exploit of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a Bluetooth connection using crafted AVRCP commands.
    *   **Specifically crafted file:** The attacker can utilize a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be within the Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device.
    *   The attacker requires the ability to establish a Bluetooth connection with the target device
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious AVRCP commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" in severity.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1.
*   The fix is included in the 2018-03-01 security patch level.
