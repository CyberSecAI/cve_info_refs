Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-13736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory leak in the `GMCommand` function within the `magick/command.c` file of GraphicsMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly deallocate memory within the `GMCommand` function, leading to memory leaks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:**  Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to gradual memory exhaustion.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If enough memory leaks occur, the system may become unstable, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the command-line interface of GraphicsMagick (`gm`).
- The specific command `gm montage POC2 /dev/null` is used to reproduce the memory leaks.
- The input `POC2` is likely an image file or a data file used by the vulnerable command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local or Remote Execution:** An attacker needs the ability to execute the `gm` command with crafted input, either locally or remotely.
- **Access to the GraphicsMagick installation:** The attacker must have access to a system where GraphicsMagick is installed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was detected using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) debugging tool, which identifies memory errors such as leaks.
- The provided information includes the ASAN output with the call stacks indicating the source of the leak.
- The vulnerability is fixed in GraphicsMagick version 1.3.32.
- The fix was applied in Fedora 29 and 30 updates.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-13736 is a memory leak vulnerability in the `GMCommand` function of GraphicsMagick. An attacker can exploit this by repeatedly executing specific commands, leading to memory exhaustion and potential denial of service. The fix involves proper memory management in the `GMCommand` function, which was implemented in version 1.3.32 of GraphicsMagick.
