Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13192:

**CVE-2017-13192**

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from improper parsing of the `slice address` parameter within the HEVC decoder, specifically when handling slices that are not the first slice in a picture. The decoder incorrectly handles a zero value for the slice address.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - Incorrect parsing of the `slice address` parameter when the slice is not the first in a picture.
    - Specifically, the code does not properly handle the case where the `slice address` is zero.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit leads to a Denial of Service (DoS).

* **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted HEVC file containing invalid slice addresses.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted HEVC media file to the vulnerable device, likely through a media playback process. No special privileges or specific positions are needed.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in CVE-2017-13192 stems from an error in parsing the `slice address` parameter in HEVC decoding when it isn't the first slice of a picture and the value is zero. This can be exploited by a remote attacker by providing crafted HEVC file, causing a denial-of-service.
