Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13250:

**CVE-2017-13250**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a memory overflow in the shared display mode within the `libavc` library. Specifically, the issue arises during the decoding process where a multiplication operation occurs at the destination instead of the source, leading to the overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Memory overflow. The vulnerability allows for writing beyond the bounds of allocated memory.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted file that triggers the memory overflow during media processing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted file. The attacker would need to entice a user or service to process the malicious file.
