{
  "CVE-2017-13082": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to ambiguities in the processing of associated protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passively eavesdropping on an FT handshake, and then replaying the reassociation request from the supplicant to the authenticator.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Accepting a retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and reinstalling the pairwise key while processing it.",
        "The access point (AP) re-installs the pairwise key by retransmitting or replaying FT Reassociation Requests."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used pairwise key (PTK-TK). Also, when the key is reinstalled, the associated packet number (nonce) and receive replay counter is reset. This causes nonce reuse, voiding any security the underlying encryption protocol is supposed to provide, allowing for decryption or injection of frames, or enabling an attacker to replay frames.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker within Wi-Fi range can replay a retransmission of the handshake message to prompt the installation of the same encryption key every time it receives message 3 from the access point. Retransmission of the handshake message from the access point occurs if a proper client acknowledgement is not received to the initial message; retransmission resets the nonce value and replay counter to their initial values. A malicious actor could force these nonce resets by replaying the appropriate handshake message.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be within Wi-Fi range of the targeted device and wireless network."
