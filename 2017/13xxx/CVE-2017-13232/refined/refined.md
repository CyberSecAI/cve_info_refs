Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13232:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `IAudioPolicyService`, where the string tags field within `audio_attributes_t` was copied from a binder parcel without proper validation to ensure it contained a null terminator (`\0`).
*   Specifically, when `audio_attributes_t` was read from a binder parcel, the tags string field was copied without checking if it contained the null terminator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The lack of null terminator verification could potentially lead to out-of-bounds reads when the tags were later used. The service might attempt to read beyond the intended memory region if a string without null termination was present in the tags field

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted binder payload with a tags attribute that does not contain null termination.
*   This out-of-bounds read could lead to information disclosure, potentially leaking sensitive memory contents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote (Local) Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered via inter-process communication using binder parcels to interact with `IAudioPolicyService`. This means a local or remote attacker capable of sending such a parcel can trigger the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send a specially crafted binder payload to the `IAudioPolicyService`. This could be achieved by a malicious app or component running on the device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided patch adds a null terminator to the end of the buffer when deserializing to prevent information disclosure due to out of bounds reads.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0 and 8.1.
