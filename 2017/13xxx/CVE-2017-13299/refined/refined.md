Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `libavc` library, specifically during the parsing of Sequence Parameter Sets (SPS). The issue arises when a new SPS is encountered, and certain values within it are not reset to zero, potentially leading to incorrect state information. There is also a check to ensure the NAL size is non-zero before being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect state management: When parsing a new SPS, the library fails to reset certain critical values, leading to use of potentially stale data, causing issues during decoding.
- Lack of size check: Without ensuring a non-zero size of NAL units, invalid memory access could occur during decoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition, which can cause the device to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Media Content: By crafting a malicious media file with specially crafted SPS data, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability and cause a device to crash.
- The attack would be triggered through the processing of the crafted media file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malformed video to the targeted device, likely through user interaction or a vulnerable media service or application.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0 and 8.1.
- The fix involves resetting values on new SPS occurrence and adding a check for non-zero NAL size.
