Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions on the "C:\GST Offline Tool" directory, where the GSTN Offline Utility tool before version 1.2 executes `winstart-server.vbs`. Because of these permissions, a local user can modify the `winstart-server.vbs` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The directory containing `winstart-server.vbs` has overly permissive access controls, allowing local users to modify its contents.
*   **Unvalidated Script Execution:** The application executes the `winstart-server.vbs` without proper validation, meaning it will execute any arbitrary code placed in the script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** By replacing `winstart-server.vbs` with malicious VBScript code, a local attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the user running the GSTN Offline Utility. This can lead to a TCP reverse shell, granting the attacker remote control of the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can potentially escalate privileges by injecting code through the vulnerable script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is a local user with the ability to modify files within the "C:\GST Offline Tool" directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have local user access on the system where the vulnerable GSTN Offline Utility tool is installed.
*   **File Write Access:** The attacker must be able to write and modify files in the "C:\GST Offline Tool" directory, specifically `winstart-server.vbs`.
