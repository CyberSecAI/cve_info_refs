    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-13228",
    "description": "A modified loop condition while parsing ref_list_reordering in the media framework could lead to remote code execution. When ref_pic_list_reordering_flag_l1 is equal to 1, the number of times that reordering_of_pic_nums_idc is not equal to 3, following ref_pic_list_reordering_flag_l1, should not exceed num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 + 1.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a modified loop condition while parsing ref_list_reordering.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper loop condition"
