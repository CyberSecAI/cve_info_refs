{
  "CVE-2017-13274": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `Uri` class incorrectly parses the host part of a URL when a backslash character is present. It continues considering characters after the backslash as part of the hostname whereas the WHATWG URL parsing algorithm, used by browsers, considers the backslash as a host terminator for hierarchical schemes.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Improper input validation of the hostname portion of a URI allows for host spoofing.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious URL could be displayed to the user with a 'safe' hostname while actually navigating to a different host when passed to a browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a specially formed URL containing a backslash and convince the user to open it in an application that incorrectly parses the host.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open the crafted URI. This could involve social engineering or embedding the link in a web page, or another application"
