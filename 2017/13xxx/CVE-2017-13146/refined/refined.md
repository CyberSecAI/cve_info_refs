Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `mat` coder in ImageMagick, specifically related to how it handles specially crafted or corrupted MATLAB image files.
*   The initial report identified a memory leak, but it was later clarified that the issue was more related to the potential for a NULL pointer dereference, which could lead to a crash. There was also an issue with the code not freeing two buffers in specific cases.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The `mat` coder had a memory leak where allocated memory was not freed under certain circumstances.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** There was a potential for a NULL pointer dereference due to improper handling of corrupted or specially crafted files, leading to a crash.
*   **Use of uninitialized data:** The coder accesses uninitialized data, which might pose a security issue or at least a bug.
*   **Double free:** The code needed to free two buffers in some exceptional circumstances, instead of just one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to a crash due to NULL pointer dereference, or memory exhaustion due to a memory leak resulting in a denial of service. The assertion failure in `DestroyImageInfo` was also a DoS vector.
*   **Unspecified impact:** The Gentoo advisory mentions the possibility of remote attackers having "other unspecified impacts" when processing a specially crafted file, which is vague, but could potentially include information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to process a specially crafted MATLAB image file using ImageMagick.
*   **Specially Crafted Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted .mat file that exploits the improper memory management and NULL pointer handling in the `mat` coder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious MATLAB image file to a user or system running a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This could be achieved through various means, like embedding the image on a website, sending it via email, or including it as part of a larger software package.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub commit `79e5dbc` shows the fix applied to `coders/mat.c`. The changes include removing redundant calls to `DestroyQuantumInfo` and properly freeing memory.
*   The Debian bug report #870013 provides detailed information about the timeline of discovery, fixes, and the affected versions within Debian.
*   The fix for this issue in Debian is included in version `8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-14`
*   The advisory from Gentoo identifies `media-gfx/imagemagick` versions prior to 6.9.9.20 as vulnerable.

In summary, CVE-2017-13146 is a vulnerability in the `mat` coder of ImageMagick that could be exploited using crafted MATLAB image files, leading to denial of service through memory leaks or crashes.
