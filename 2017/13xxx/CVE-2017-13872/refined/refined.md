Here's the analysis of the provided content related to CVE-2017-13872:

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-13872 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS High Sierra (10.13 and 10.13.1) related to how the system handles authentication attempts to the root account. By entering “root” as the username and leaving the password field blank, the system allows access. This occurs because the system incorrectly processes authentication failures when an account doesn't have existing 'shadowhash' data, leading to an arbitrary password being set.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a logic error in the `opendirectoryd` daemon, specifically in the `od_verify_crypt_password` function and its interaction with shadow hash data:
*   When a user attempts to log into a disabled account (like root) that lacks 'shadowhash' data, the system tries to 'upgrade' the account to have it.
*   The `od_verify_crypt_password` function, which is supposed to verify the password during this upgrade, uses a flag to signal a successful login but fails to validate the result of the password verification. The result of the verification (whether the provided password matches the expected) is stored in a variable passed to the function, but this is never actually checked after function call, it only checks if function return value is non-zero.
*   Because there are no checks after call, if a user provides *any* password (including blank) for the 'root' user (or other disabled user) the logic assumes a valid password was provided, proceeding with the user-provided password for account creation. This allows any user to create a new root account with an arbitrary password, or a blank password if the password field is left empty.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect logic in password validation:** The `od_verify_crypt_password` function fails to validate the authentication result correctly, allowing arbitrary password usage during account creation/upgrade.
*   **Missing check on verification result:** The code does not check if the password verification actually succeeded before upgrading the account. It only checks for a non-zero return value of the function.
*   **Creation of root user without credentials:** By exploiting this flaw, it's possible to create a root user account without providing credentials.
*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if screen sharing or remote management is enabled, allowing a remote attacker to gain root access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Any local user can gain root privileges without a password, gaining complete control over the affected system.
*   **Remote Access:** With screen sharing or remote management enabled, attackers can remotely gain root access.
*   **Malware Installation:** Malicious actors can install malware or make unauthorized changes to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker uses the macOS login window, entering "root" as the username and leaving the password field blank.
*  **Remote access:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability via the Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) protocol if screen sharing or remote management is enabled, targeting port 5900.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access (Local attack):** The attacker needs access to the system to manipulate the login screen.
*   **Network Access (Remote attack):** Requires access to the network, with either Screen Sharing or Remote Management enabled on a vulnerable host.
*   **Basic knowledge of macOS authentication:** The attacker must be aware of how macOS's login system behaves.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered and reported on Apple developer forums and Twitter.
*   The vulnerability was quickly patched by Apple but the patch had some issues. First version broke file sharing, and applying patch on 10.13, then upgrading to 10.13.1 reintroduced the vulnerability, until the system was rebooted.
*   The vulnerability is associated with the `Directory Utility` component in macOS.
*   Metasploit has a module for exploiting this vulnerability remotely.
