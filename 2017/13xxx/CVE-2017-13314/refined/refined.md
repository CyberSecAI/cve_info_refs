Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check within the `setAllowOnlyVpnForUids` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local malicious application could bypass user interaction requirements to gain unauthorized access to additional permissions. Specifically, this involves the ability to bypass normal permission checks when setting the "Allow Only VPN for UIDs" setting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could grant a malicious application additional permissions it shouldn't have, potentially enabling it to access sensitive user data, perform privileged actions, or compromise the device's security.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** A locally installed application on the device is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
- The attacker would need to exploit this specific missing permission check in the `setAllowOnlyVpnForUids` function.

**Additional Technical Details**
The fix implemented adds a permission check within the `setAllowOnlyVpnForUids` function. The commit message mentions:
