- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper configuration of the System Health service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass vulnerability in the System Health service which listens on TCP port 18080. By submitting a crafted request, an attacker can bypass authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass authentication to access the web application. This can be leveraged to potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM by combining with other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted requests to the System Health service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected system on TCP port 18080. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
