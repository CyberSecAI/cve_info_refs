Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the application does not adequately protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. The specific nature of the unprotected sensitive information is not specified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522):** The application fails to properly protect sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:

*   **Information Exposure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, implying that credentials may be exposed.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:**  The impact description in the advisory states "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in information exposure or allow arbitrary code execution". While not specific to this CVE it indicates that the credentials could be used to gain further unauthorized access leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Integrity and Availability Impact:** CVSS v3 score indicates high impact to integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Requires Low Privilege:** An attacker with low-level access can exploit this vulnerability
*   **Low complexity:** The attack is of low complexity indicating that it does not require a high level of technical skills

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable device over the network.
*   **Low Privilege:** The attacker needs to have minimal access or credentials on the system.
*   **Low skill:** The advisory states a "Low skill level is needed to exploit".

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory also lists other vulnerabilities (Relative Path Traversal, Insufficient Entropy, Cross-site Scripting) affecting the same device, but those are distinct from CVE-2017-13998.
* The advisory recommends updating the firmware to version 6.2.0 to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
