Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13278:

**CVE-2017-13278**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the `Media Player` component of the Android Framework, specifically within the `Media Player Base` functionality. The root cause is related to how the `Media Player Base` handles notifications. The commit message "Refactor Media Player Base's notify" and the AOSP link provided indicate that a refactoring was done to address this vulnerability, suggesting a flawed notification mechanism.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is classified as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP). This suggests that an attacker could potentially manipulate the flawed notification mechanism within the Media Player to gain unauthorized access or control over certain aspects of the system, circumventing normal permissions or security restrictions.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit would lead to an elevation of privilege. This means a malicious party can escalate privileges, which could potentially lead to accessing sensitive information or executing arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process

*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious media file or manipulating media playback to trigger the flawed notification handling in `Media Player Base`. This could be done remotely, or locally through a malicious application.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to influence the media playback process. This might involve tricking a user into opening a malicious media file or having a malicious application that controls media playback, making the attack vector both remote (via media files) and local (via malicious apps).

**Summary of additional information:**

*   The provided AOSP commit `8a54af87b632c03ff2ae15a4a088801bb39fdae7` directly addresses this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1.
* The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
