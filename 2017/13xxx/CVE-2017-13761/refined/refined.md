Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from an overly restrictive list of successful HTTP response codes that the Fastly CDN module for Magento2 considered cacheable. Only 200, 301 and 404 codes were initially treated as successful and were cached. Other response codes, particularly redirect responses (e.g., 302, 307), resulted in an early return without proper handling, and their responses being cached. The caching of redirects, especially those used in authentication flows involving cookies, led to user session data being mixed up.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Caching of Redirects:** The primary weakness was caching HTTP redirects, specifically those containing session-related cookies, for a short period.
- **Inadequate HTTP Response Handling:** The module did not correctly identify and handle a wider range of successful HTTP response codes.
- **Lack of Cookie Stripping:**  The module failed to remove "Set-Cookie" headers from error responses before caching them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Leakage:** An attacker could potentially gain access to another user's session data by exploiting the incorrect caching of redirects. When a user would make a request after a redirect, the cached cookie of another user may be returned, logging them into that user's session. This is caused by the third-party authentication plugins (like OAuth) that relies on redirects instead of POST requests.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive user information associated with the leaked session could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Traffic Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the standard HTTP requests and responses. An attacker wouldn't need to directly manipulate anything but would need to generate a request that causes a redirect response. The vulnerability is triggered by the way the Fastly CDN module handles these responses and caches them.
- **Third-Party Authentication Plugins:** The vulnerability becomes more critical if the application uses a third-party authentication plugin (like OAuth) that relies on redirects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker doesn't require any special privileges or access on the server-side.
- **Basic Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application. They would likely need to have a user account on the affected application to trigger the redirects in question.

**Additional Details:**
- **Fix:** The issue was resolved in version 1.2.26 of the Fastly CDN module by:
  - Expanding the list of considered successful HTTP response codes to include 200, 203, 300, 301, 302, 404, and 410.
  - Stripping the "Set-Cookie" header from error responses (those that are not one of the above) before caching them.
- **VCL Code Tweaks:** The fix also involved minor VCL (Varnish Configuration Language) code tweaks.
- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the Fastly CDN module prior to 1.2.26 are affected by this vulnerability.
- **Mitigation:**  Users were advised to upgrade to version 1.2.26 or later.
