{
  "CVE-2017-13704": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability was caused by a sign confusion in the size argument given to memset(). This would result in memset being called with a negative size argument, which would cause it to interpret it as a large positive number and attempt to write beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of signed integers leading to an out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (crash).",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS queries to dnsmasq.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to the dnsmasq server.",
     "details": "The vulnerable memset() calls were introduced as a hardening measure to zero buffers where response packets would be constructed.  The flaw was introduced in dnsmasq version 2.77 and fixed prior to 2.78. No Red Hat products were affected."
