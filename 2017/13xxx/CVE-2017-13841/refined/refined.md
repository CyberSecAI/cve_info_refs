- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A validation issue existed in the kernel, which was addressed with improved input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Input sanitization vulnerability leading to the ability to read restricted memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An application may be able to read restricted memory.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present within the kernel, so a local application could potentially exploit this.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a local user capable of running an application on the affected system.
