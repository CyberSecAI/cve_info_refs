Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-13052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer over-read in the `cfm_print()` function within the `print-cfm.c` file of tcpdump. Specifically, the issue occurs when decoding the Sender ID TLV (Type-Length-Value).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Over-read:** The code does not properly validate the length of the input buffer while parsing the Sender ID TLV, leading to a potential read beyond the buffer's boundaries. This happens in `cfm_network_addr_print()` and during MAC address handling in `cfm_print()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory.
- **Denial of Service:** The over-read could cause a crash due to accessing invalid memory locations, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network packets with a crafted CFM (Connectivity Fault Management) PDU containing a malformed Sender ID TLV can trigger the vulnerability when processed by `tcpdump`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker would need to be able to inject packets with crafted CFM PDUs on a network segment where a vulnerable version of `tcpdump` is in use.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without needing any authentication.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The fix involves adding a length argument to `cfm_network_addr_print()` for input buffer validation.
- Length checks for MAC address chassis ID are added in `cfm_print()`.
- Error handling was adjusted so that the parsing skips to the next TLV instead of stopping, so other valid TLVs can be parsed instead of stopping the whole PDU decode.
- Comments are added to clarify code flow and reference IEEE standards.
- New and more specific error messages are added.
- A test case with a capture file provided by the reporter is added to confirm the fix.

The vulnerability is present in `tcpdump` versions prior to 4.9.2.
