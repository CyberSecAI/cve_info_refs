Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to an incorrect read size in the `bta_gattc_cache_load` function. This function attempts to read a fixed number of attributes (0xFF) into a buffer sized according to the actual number of attributes (`num_attr`).  If `num_attr` is smaller than 0xFF, then the read operation overflows the buffer.
- The root cause is that the code attempts to read a predefined amount of attribute data (0xFF), but the buffer size is actually based on a possibly smaller value `num_attr`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic heap-based buffer overflow. The code attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.
- **Incorrect Size Handling:** The code incorrectly assumes a fixed size for the attribute data it reads, rather than using the actual size of attribute data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Although this specific commit message doesn't detail the impact beyond a potential buffer overflow, the Android Security Bulletin explicitly classifies this as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this buffer overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **System Crash:** The code contains a dynamic buffer overflow check in `CopperheadOS`, which aborts the process and prevents the overflow, at least when that check is enabled. However, the default Android configuration is not protected by this check.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The provided commit description points toward local exploitation as it refers to a system call being the point of vulnerability. However, the Android Security Bulletin mentions the potential for a proximate attacker to execute code.
- **Specifically Crafted Data:** An attacker needs to craft data that leads to a smaller `num_attr` value and trigger the `bta_gattc_cache_load` function. The code reads the incorrect amount of attribute data, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to run code on the target Android device. The Android Security Bulletin notes that a proximate attacker could exploit this.
- **Knowledge of Bluetooth GATT:** An attacker would need knowledge of the Bluetooth Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) cache mechanism. The function `bta_gattc_cache_load` implies an exploitation point within the Bluetooth subsystem.
- **Ability to manipulate `num_attr`:** The attacker would need the ability to influence the value of `num_attr` such that it is smaller than the fixed value of 0xFF.

**Additional details:**
- The patch commit message also mentions that the issue would fail with the `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` feature enabled, indicating that some degree of protection was provided by this compile-time check.
- The fix involves adding a limit of `0xFFFF` and rewriting the commit message.
