Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-13060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `ReadMATImage` function of ImageMagick. This occurs during the processing of a specially crafted MAT image file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The `ReadMATImage` function fails to properly deallocate memory that was allocated during image processing. This leads to a memory leak, where memory is allocated but never freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly processing malicious MAT files, an attacker can cause the application to consume excessive memory, ultimately leading to a denial-of-service condition. The application may become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image File:** The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted MAT image file to ImageMagick. This file is designed to trigger the memory leak when processed by the `ReadMATImage` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted MAT file to a system running vulnerable versions of ImageMagick. This can be achieved through various means, including:
    - Enticing a user to open the crafted file via a website, email or shared folder.
    - Uploading it to a web server that uses ImageMagick for processing.
    - Using ImageMagick within an application to process the file.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The provided github content includes a stack trace and identifies the specific function, `ReadMATImage`, that triggers the memory leak.
- The github content also provides a proof-of-concept file for testing.
- The Ubuntu security notice (USN-3681-1) confirms that multiple vulnerabilities were addressed, including CVE-2017-13060.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201711-07) lists CVE-2017-13060 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed by the update.
- The Gentoo advisory also indicates that the impact of this and other vulnerabilities could include information disclosure, denial of service, or other unspecified impacts.

In summary, CVE-2017-13060 is a memory leak vulnerability in ImageMagick that can lead to a denial of service when processing a specially crafted MAT image file.
