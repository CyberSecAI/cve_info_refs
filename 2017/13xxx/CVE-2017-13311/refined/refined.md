Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `readFromParcel` function, where the length of the last array is not correctly validated. Specifically, the length of the last array read from the parcel should match the value of `mNextIndex`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code fails to properly verify the length of the last array read from a parcel, leading to a potential mismatch with the expected size.
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability is categorized as an Elevation of Privilege issue, meaning a malicious application could exploit it to gain access to permissions it should not have.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious application could potentially bypass user interaction requirements to gain additional permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious local application could craft a specific parcel with incorrect array length data.
- This crafted parcel is then used in the `readFromParcel` function to exploit the improper length validation, potentially leading to an elevation of privilege.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a locally installed malicious application.
- The application needs to be able to craft specific parcels to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves verifying the length of the last array against the `mNextIndex` value during the read from parcel operation.
- The provided code changes indicate the fix is related to handling `SavedState` in the internal `ViewPager` component, which suggests the vulnerability could be triggered when restoring the state of a `ViewPager`.
