- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The webserver does not properly authenticate users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Authentication (CWE-287)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows malicious users to access human-machine interface (HMI) pages or modify programmable logic controller (PLC) variables without authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires low skill level to exploit and no prior authentication is needed.
