Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-13737:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `MagickFree` function within `magick/memory.c` of GraphicsMagick. Specifically, an invalid free operation occurs, leading to a crash.
- The root cause is related to how GraphicsMagick calculates the number of objects in an array `NumberOfObjectsInArray`. The formula `(octets+size-1)/size` was changed to `octets/size` which now rounds down.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Invalid free: The program attempts to free memory that was either already freed, not allocated using the `malloc` or `calloc`, or an invalid memory address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a denial-of-service due to the crash caused by the invalid free. This can make the application or system processing the image file unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed image file: The vulnerability is triggered when GraphicsMagick processes a specially crafted image file. In particular, a TIFF image file is mentioned to trigger the vulnerability through the `ReadTIFFImage` function.
- Command-line utility: The vulnerability is triggered through the `gm montage` command. The `montage` function calls `ReadTIFFImage`, where the memory corruption occurs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide input: The attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed image file to a system running GraphicsMagick or a related application using the library.
- No special privileges: The vulnerability does not require any specific privileges to trigger.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The issue is not in the latest libtiff, but an older version.
- A patch to `magick/studio.h` fixes the problem.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-13737 is an invalid free vulnerability in GraphicsMagick, specifically in the `MagickFree` function called by `ReadTIFFImage`, that can be triggered when processing a specially crafted image file, leading to a denial of service.
