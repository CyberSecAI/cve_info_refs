Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a change in the `mbaff` flag within the SPS (Sequence Parameter Set). Specifically, when the `mbaff` flag changes, the decoder context requires re-initialization of the NMB group and other variables. Failure to properly re-initialize these elements can lead to issues during decoding. The root cause seems to be improper handling of changes in the `mbaff` flag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper re-initialization of decoder context variables upon a change of the `mbaff` flag, which is related to decoding of video.
- This can result in a heap overflow while parsing `sei_message`, due to a too small buffer allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition, as indicated by the "DoS | High" entries associated with the CVE in the provided table. The vulnerability can cause heap overflow and thus crash the process which is decoding the media.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during the decoding process. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious video stream with specific `mbaff` flag changes to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to be able to provide a crafted media file or stream that is processed by the vulnerable media framework. This could be achieved through various means like media sharing, playback of a video from a malicious site, or by utilizing an application that processes media files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves re-initializing necessary variables within the decoder context upon a change in the `mbaff` flag, as well as increasing allocation size and adding checks to `sei` parsing.
- The provided links point to specific commits in the AOSP repository which address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in `libavc`, an external component of the Android media framework.
- The fix was tested using ASAN before and after the fix to ensure there are no memory errors with the vulnerability patched.
