Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13142:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of PNG file sizes within the ImageMagick library. Specifically, the `ReadPNGImage` function didn't verify if the file size was large enough to contain a valid PNG datastream before processing it. Similar issue was present in `ReadJNGImage`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient data validation:** The code didn't check if the provided PNG/JNG file contained enough data for a valid image before attempting to process it.
*   **Potential for out-of-bounds read/write:** If the file was too small, the program would try to read data from beyond the allocated buffer. This could lead to crashes or other undefined behaviors.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a specially crafted, undersized PNG or JNG image, an attacker could cause the ImageMagick application to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a DoS.
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated in all sources, some security advisories mention the possibility of information disclosure due to memory access issues when processing malformed files.
*  **Potential arbitrary code execution:** Though the main impact mentioned in the advisories is denial of service, the possibility of arbitrary code execution is mentioned as well. This may be a consequence of the memory issues.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious image file:** An attacker could craft a PNG or JNG file with insufficient data and then trick a user or application using ImageMagick into processing it.
*   **File upload:** If an application allows users to upload image files that are processed with ImageMagick, an attacker could upload a malicious image.
*   **Image processing pipelines:** In systems where ImageMagick is used as part of image processing pipelines, an attacker might be able to inject such images.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide the malformed image to ImageMagick:** The attacker needs a way to make ImageMagick process the malicious image. This can be done via a file upload, by convincing a user to open a file or through other means.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involves adding a check using `GetBlobSize()` in `ReadPNGImage` and `ReadJNGImage` functions to ensure the file has a minimum size before processing.
* The fix was implemented in two commits : [aa84944b405acebbeefe871d0f64969b9e9f31ac](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/aa84944b405acebbeefe871d0f64969b9e9f31ac) and  [46e3aabbf8d59a1bdebdbb65acb9b9e0484577d3](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/46e3aabbf8d59a1bdebdbb65acb9b9e0484577d3)
*  Multiple distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Gentoo were affected. Patches were released for these distributions.
*   The vulnerability was found in multiple versions of ImageMagick.
*   The bug report ([#870105](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=870105)) on Debian's bug tracker provides more information on the specific commits that address this vulnerability.
