Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `elf_i386_get_synthetic_symtab` function in `elf32-i386.c` (and a similar issue in `elf64-x86-64.c`).
*   The function fails to properly validate the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) section size before attempting to read its contents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read. If the PLT section size is invalid or smaller than expected, the function will attempt to read beyond the allocated memory region leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the `objdump` utility due to the heap-buffer-overflow. This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service if an attacker can control the input file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious ELF file:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious ELF file with an invalid or truncated PLT section size.
*   **`objdump` Usage:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `objdump` utility processes this specially crafted ELF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an ELF file.
*   The attacker needs to be able to run the `objdump` utility with the crafted malicious ELF file.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided ASAN output shows a heap-buffer-overflow when reading 2 bytes at address `0x6020000000f1`, which is outside the allocated region `[0x6020000000f0,0x6020000000f1)`.
*   The vulnerability exists in binutils version 2.29.
*   The fix involves adding a size check for the PLT section before processing it.
*   The vulnerability is also present in `elf64-x86-64.c`
