Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-13249:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `libmpeg2` library. Specifically, it involves an insufficient check of the output buffer size provided by the application during a process call. This lack of validation can lead to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is the inadequate check on the size of the output buffer provided by the application before writing data to it.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** When the provided output buffer size is too small, the code can write data outside the boundaries of the buffer, potentially overwriting memory and corrupting application data or code.
- **Remote Code Execution:** This vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This allows the attacker to gain control over the affected device, potentially leading to severe consequences like data theft, malware installation, and complete system takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted File:** The primary attack vector is through the use of a specially crafted file that triggers the vulnerable code path within `libmpeg2`. This file could be an audio or video file, or other data that is processed by the media framework.
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, for example by sending a malicious file over the network, or tricking a user into opening a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to deliver a malicious file:** The attacker needs a way to get the specially crafted file onto the target device and have the media framework process it. This could be through various means such as network access, web browsing, or malicious applications.
- **No special access or privileges:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without needing any specific user interaction or device privileges.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must have a solid understanding of the vulnerability in `libmpeg2` to create the exploit file correctly.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit log message "Adding Error Check for Output Buffer Size" and "The output buffer size given by the application, needs to be checked in every process call. This is required in the case of resolution change." provides more technical detail about the vulnerability
- The fix involves adding proper checks to validate output buffer sizes in `libmpeg2` to prevent out-of-bounds writes
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1, indicating a wide range of affected devices.
