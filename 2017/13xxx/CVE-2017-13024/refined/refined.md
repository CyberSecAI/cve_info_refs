Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13024:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content confirms that this CVE relates to a buffer over-read vulnerability in the `tcpdump` application, specifically within the IPv6 mobility parsing logic in the `print-mobility.c` file. This aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause:**

The root cause is a missing or insufficient bounds check in the `mobility_opt_print()` function within `print-mobility.c`, which handles IPv6 mobility options.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. The code attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer when parsing mobility options, specifically Network Interface Identifier (NI) option.
*   **Missing Bounds Check:** The code was missing a proper check to ensure that it does not read beyond the bounds of the buffer.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The over-read could cause the application to crash.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The over-read could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the process's memory.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted network packet containing malicious IPv6 mobility options.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted IPv6 packets to a vulnerable system running tcpdump. This can be from a remote location or an adjacent network.
*   **Malicious Packet Construction:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious IPv6 packet that contains specifically crafted mobility options to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The fix involves adding a bounds check before fetching data, which prevents the out-of-bounds read.
*   The provided github commit `7d3aba9f06899d0128ef46e8a2fa143c6fad8f62` shows the fix added to `print-mobility.c`, which uses `ND_TCHECK_16BITS()` macro before accessing the buffer. A subsequent commit `2e1f6d9320afa83abc1ff716c7981fa504edadf2` adds another test case for the fix.
*   The issue was reported by Bhargava Shastry from SecT/TU Berlin.
*   The fix was included in `tcpdump` version 4.9.2.
