```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `ctl_ctloutput` function in XNU does not check the return value of a call to `sooptcopyin`. This allows a race condition where a privileged process can read uninitialized kernel heap data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Race condition",
      "Information leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged process can read an arbitrary amount of uninitialized kernel heap data, potentially leaking kernel pointers and other sensitive information. This can be used to defeat kASLR.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling `getsockopt` on a kernel control socket with an invalid address, then remapping the address to cause a copyout of uninitialized data.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have root privileges and the ability to use `getsockopt` on a kernel control socket. They also need the ability to map and unmap memory pages."
