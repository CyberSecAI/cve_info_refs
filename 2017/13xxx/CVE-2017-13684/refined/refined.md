- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper program execution due to incorrect literal handling, leading to CPM stack corruption. Specifically, crafted code sequences cause invalid stack frames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CPM stack corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Impacts range from program termination through an `INVALID INDEX` or `INVALID ARGUMENT` error, due to an invalid stack state, to other unspecified behaviors. The potential for system compromise is high, as indicated by the CVSS score.
- **Attack vectors**: Crafted code sequences are the attack vector. This suggests a software-based attack leveraging vulnerable code paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to execute the crafted code sequences on the affected system. The CVSS vector indicates:
    - Local access is required (`AV:L`).
    - High attack complexity (`AC:H`).
    - Low privileges are needed (`PR:L`).
    - No user interaction is required (`UI:N`).
    - The vulnerability allows for a change in scope (`S:C`).
    - High confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact (`C:H/I:H/A:H`).
    - Exploit is unproven (`E:U`).
    - Official fix is available (`RL:O`).
    - Exploitability of the fix is confirmed (`RC:C`).
    - Confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements are undefined, low and low (`CR:X/IR:L/AR:L`)
    - Modified attack vector: local. Modified attack complexity: high. Modified privileges required: low. Modified user interaction: none. Modified scope: Changed. Modified impact confidentiality/integrity/availability: high/high/high (`MAV:L/MAC:H/MPR:L/MUI:N/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:H`)
