- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue in APFS when deleting keys during hibernation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** APFS encryption keys may not be securely deleted after hibernating.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  APFS encryption keys might not be securely deleted.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during the hibernation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to gain access to the system during or after a hibernation event to potentially exploit the vulnerability.
