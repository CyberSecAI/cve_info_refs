{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Hikvision iVMS-4200 software sends admin passwords in plain text via email during the password reset process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Plain text transmission of sensitive information (admin passwords)",
      "Lack of proper authentication and authorization in the password reset process.",
      "Use of a hardcoded 'dealer' string for authentication bypass.",
	    "Predictable password recovery mechanism using AES encryption with fixed keys, making it easily cracked."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain full administrative access to the Hikvision iVMS-4200 software and connected recorders/devices by intercepting the password reset email or by cracking the password recovery mechanism.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept the password reset email.",
      "Direct access to the email account receiving the password reset email.",
	    "Exploitation of the password recovery mechanism by decrypting the password after obtaining the key."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to intercept the email communication, gain access to the email inbox, or decrypt the password reset mechanism. No special network position is mentioned besides the ability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks."
