The provided content is related to CVE-2017-13107.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys within the Live.me application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798): The application contains a hard-coded cryptographic key.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially gain elevated access to the application's data and/or functionalities by using the hardcoded key. The specific impact depends on how and where the key is used within the application.  The report mentions a worst-case scenario of code execution as a system user, however the impact may vary across different devices and vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is not explicitly detailed, but it involves leveraging the hard-coded cryptographic key within the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to reverse engineer the application or otherwise obtain the hardcoded key, and be able to use this key to achieve an elevated state.
