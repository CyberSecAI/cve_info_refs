Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13048:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content from multiple sources, including Red Hat, Gentoo, and GitHub, explicitly lists CVE-2017-13048 as a vulnerability addressed in their security updates for tcpdump.
   - The commit message from tcpdump's repository also specifically mentions a fix related to "CVE-2017-13048/RSVP". This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The core vulnerability is a **buffer over-read** in the `rsvp_obj_print()` function within `print-rsvp.c`, specifically when handling RSVP FAST_REROUTE objects (Class-Num 205 from RFC 4090 Section 4.1).
   - The code incorrectly accessed the buffer contents before making the required bounds check.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Buffer Over-read:** The primary weakness is the potential to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing certain RSVP objects, which can cause a crash or expose sensitive memory.
   - **Improper Input Validation:** The lack of proper bounds checking before accessing the buffer leads to the over-read.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malformed RSVP packet could cause tcpdump to crash due to the buffer over-read.
  - **Potential arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, the Gentoo advisory notes that "the worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code." This is a potential impact due to memory corruption, although not confirmed in other sources.
   - **Information Leakage:** Over-reading memory could potentially expose sensitive information contained in memory.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **Network-based:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted RSVP packets to a system running a vulnerable version of `tcpdump`.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system. This generally implies network accessibility, but does not necessarily require being on the same local network.
   - **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to create malformed RSVP packets that trigger the vulnerable code path within `tcpdump`.
   - **No special privileges:** The vulnerability does not require special privileges from the attacker side.

**Additional Details from Content:**
   - **Affected Versions:** Versions of tcpdump prior to 4.9.2 are vulnerable.
   - **Patched Versions:** Tcpdump version 4.9.2 and later addresses this issue.
   - **Fix:** The fix involved rearranging the code within the `rsvp_obj_print()` function to perform the bounds check before accessing the buffer contents.
    - A test case was added to ensure the issue is resolved.
   - **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects various Linux distributions (Red Hat, Debian, Gentoo) and macOS.
    - Red Hat identifies the vulnerability as part of their Product Enhancement Advisory RHEA-2018:0705.
    - Apple addresses the vulnerability in macOS High Sierra 10.13.1, Security Update 2017-001 Sierra, and Security Update 2017-004 El Capitan.
   - **CVSS Metrics:** The GitHub advisory indicates the following:
        - **Severity:** Critical (9.8 / 10)
        - **Attack Vector:** Network
        - **Attack Complexity:** Low
        - **Privileges Required:** None
        - **User Interaction:** None
        - **Confidentiality Impact:** High
        - **Integrity Impact:** High
        - **Availability Impact:** High

In summary, CVE-2017-13048 is a critical vulnerability caused by a buffer over-read in the RSVP parsing logic of `tcpdump`, allowing for potential DoS, information leakage, and possibly arbitrary code execution. It is remotely exploitable and requires crafting specific RSVP packets. The vulnerability has been addressed in `tcpdump` versions 4.9.2 and later and is patched by several vendors.
