| [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1056061#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2017-10-16 09:56:28 UTC  ``` From: Jouni Malinen  Published: October 16, 2017 Identifiers: - CERT case ID: VU#228519 - CVE-2017-13077 - CVE-2017-13078 - CVE-2017-13079 - CVE-2017-13080 - CVE-2017-13081 - CVE-2017-13082 - CVE-2017-13084 (not applicable) - CVE-2017-13086 - CVE-2017-13087 - CVE-2017-13088 Latest version available from: <https://w1.fi/security/2017-1/>  Vulnerability  A vulnerability was found in how a number of implementations can be triggered to reconfigure WPA/WPA2/RSN keys (TK, GTK, or IGTK) by replaying a specific frame that is used to manage the keys. Such reinstallation of the encryption key can result in two different types of vulnerabilities: disabling replay protection and significantly reducing the security of encryption to the point of allowing frames to be decrypted or some parts of the keys to be determined by an attacker depending on which cipher is used.  This document focuses on the cases that apply to systems using hostapd (AP) or wpa_supplicant (station), but it should be noted that the generic vulnerability itself is applicable to other implementations and may have different impact in other cases.  This vulnerability can in theory apply to any case where a TK (the pairwise/unicast encryption key used with TKIP, CCMP, GCMP), a GTK (group/multicast encryption key), or an IGTK (group management frame integrity protection key) is configured by the Authentication/Supplicant component to the WLAN driver/firmware taking care of the TX/RX path and encryption/decryption of frames.  If the same key is configured multiple times, it is likely that the transmit and receive packet numbers (PN, IPN, RSC/TSC, etc.) are cleared to a smaller value (zero in case of pairwise keys, zero or at least a smaller value than the last used value in case of group keys). When this happens with the same key, this breaks replay protection on RX side and can result in reuse of packet numbers on TX side. The former may allow replaying of previously delivered packets (without the attacker being able to decrypt them or modify their contents) while the latter may result in more severe issues on the TX side due to resulting CCM nonce replay and related issues with GCMP and TKIP. The TX side issue may make it significantly easier for the attacker to decrypt frames and determine some parts of the keys (e.g., a Michael MIC key in case of TKIP).  Impact on AP/hostapd  On the AP side, this generic issue has been determined to be applicable in the case where hostapd is used to operate an RSN/WPA2 network with FT (Fast BSS Transition from IEEE 802.11r) enabled. Replaying of the Reassociation Request frame can be used to get the AP reinstalling the TK which results in the AP accepting previously delivered unicast frames from the station and the AP reusing previously used packet numbers (local TX packet number gets reset to zero). This latter issue on the TX side can result in CCM nonce reuse which invalidates CCMP security properties. In case of TKIP this can result in the attacker being able to determine part of the TK more easily and with GCMP, result in similar issues.  It should be noted that the AP side issue with FT would be close to applying to FILS authentication (from IEEE 802.11ai) in hostapd with replaying of (Re)Association Request frames. However, due to a different handling of the repeated association processing with FILS, this would actually result in the station getting immediately disconnected which prevents this attack in practice. In addition, the FILS implementation in the current hostapd version is still experimental and documented as being discouraged in production use cases.  Another area of potentially reduced security was identified when looking into these issues. When AP/Authenticator implementation in hostapd is requested to rekey the PTK without performing EAP reauthentication (either through local periodic rekeying or due to a request from an association station), the ANonce value does not get updated. This results in the new 4-way handshake depending on the station/supplicant side generating a new, unique (for the current PMK/PSK) SNonce for the PTK derivation to result in a new key. While a properly working supplicant would do so, if there is a supplicant implementation that does not, this combination could result in deriving the same PTK again. When the TK from that PTK gets configured in the driver, this would result in reinstalling the same key and the same issues as described above for the FT protocol case.  Impact on station/wpa_supplicant  On the station side, this generic issue has been determined to be applicable in the cases where wpa_supplicant processes a group key (GTK or IGTK) update from the AP. An attacker that is able to limit access to frame delivery may be able to extract two update messages and deliver those to the station with significant time delay between them. When wpa_supplicant processes the second message, it may end up reinstalling the same key to the driver and when doing this, clear the RX packet number to an old value. This would allow the attacker to replay all group-addressed frames that the AP sent between the time the key update message was originally sent and the time when the attacker forwarded the second frame to the station. The attacker would not be able to decrypt or modify the frames based on this vulnerability, though. There is an exception to this with older wpa_supplicant versions as noted below in version specific notes.  For the current wpa_supplicant version (v2.6), there is also an additional EAPOL-Key replay sequence where an additional forged EAPOL-Key message can be used to bypass the existing protection for the pairwise key reconfiguration in a manner that ends up configuring a known TK that an attacker could use to decrypt any frame sent by the station and to inject arbitrary unicast frames. Similar issues are reachable in older versions as noted below.  PeerKey / TDLS PeerKey  As far as the related CVE-2017-13084 (reinstallation of the STK key in the PeerKey handshake) is concerned, it should be noted that PeerKey implementation in wpa_supplicant is not fully functional and the actual installation of the key into the driver does not work. As such, this item is not applicable in practice. Furthermore, the PeerKey handshake for IEEE 802.11e DLS is obsolete and not known to have been deployed.  As far as the TDLS PeerKey handshake is concerned (CVE-2017-13086), wpa_supplicant implementation is already rejecting TPK M2 retries, so the reconfiguration issue cannot apply for it. For TPK M3, there is a theoretical impact. However, if that frame is replayed, the current wpa_supplicant implementation ends up tearing down the TDLS link immediately and as such, there is no real window for performing the attack. Furthermore, TPK M3 goes through the AP path and if RSN is used there, that frame has replay protection, so the attacker could not perform the attack. If the AP path were to use WEP, the frame could be replayed, though. That said, if WEP is used on the AP path, it would be fair to assume that there is no security in the network, so a new attack vector would be of small additional value.  With older wpa_supplicant versions, it may be possible for an attacker to cause TPK M2 to be retransmitted with delay that would be able to trigger reinstallation of TK on the peer receiving TPK M2 (CVE-2017-13086). This may open a short window for the attack with v2.3, v2.4, and v2.5; and a longer window with older versions.  Vulnerable versions/configurations  For the AP/Authenticator TK (unicast) reinstallation in FT protocol (CVE-2017-13082):  hostapd v0.7.2 and newer with FT enabled (i.e., practically all versions that include full FT implementation). FT needs to be enabled in the runtime configuration to make this applicable.  For the AP/Authenticator missing ANonce during PTK rekeying:  All hostapd versions.  For the station/Supplicant side GTK/IGTK reinstallation and TK configuration:  All wpa_supplicant versions. The impact on older versions can be more severe due to earlier changes in this area: v2.3 and older can also reinstall the pairwise key and as such have similar impact as the AP FT case (CVE-2017-13077); v2.4 and v2.5 end up configuring an all-zero TK which breaks the normal data path, but could allow an attacker to decrypt all following frames from the station and to inject arbitrary frames to the station. In addition, a different message sequence involving 4-way handshake can result in configuration of an all-zero TK in v2.6 and the current snapshot of the development repository as of the publication of this advisory.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
0. Revision history
v1.0 2017-10-17 Initial release.
v1.1 2017-10-19 Add patches for 10.x releases.
I. Background
Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) is a security protocol developed by the
Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks.
hostapd and wpa\_supplicant are implementations of user space daemon for
access points and wireless client that implements the WPA2 protocol.
II. Problem Description
A vulnerability was found in how a number of implementations can be
triggered to reconfigure WPA/WPA2/RSN keys (TK, GTK, or IGTK) by
replaying a specific frame that is used to manage the keys.
III. Impact
Such reinstallation of the encryption key can result in two different
types of vulnerabilities: disabling replay protection and significantly
reducing the security of encryption to the point of allowing frames to
be decrypted or some parts of the keys to be determined by an attacker
depending on which cipher is used.
IV. Workaround
An updated version of wpa\_supplicant is available in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection. Install version 2.6\_2 or later of the
security/wpa\_supplicant port/pkg. Once installed, update /etc/rc.conf
to use the new binary:
wpa\_supplicant\_program="/usr/local/sbin/wpa\_supplicant"
and restart networking.
An updated version of hostapd is available in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection. Install version 2.6\_1 or later of the net/hostapd port/pkg.
Once installed, update /etc/rc.conf to use the new binary:
hostapd\_program="/usr/local/sbin/hostapd"
and restart hostapd.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Restart the Wi-Fi network interfaces/hostapd or reboot the system.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Restart the Wi-Fi network interfaces/hostapd or reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE, 11.1-RELEASE, and 11-STABLE]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:07/wpa-11.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:07/wpa-11.patch.asc
# gpg --verify wpa-11.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE, 10.4-RELEASE, and 10-STABLE]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:07/wpa-10.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:07/wpa-10.patch.asc
# gpg --verify wpa-10.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

# RHSA-2017:2911 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: wpa\_supplicant security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2911)

## Topic

An update for wpa\_supplicant is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The wpa\_supplicant packages contain an 802.1X Supplicant with support for WEP, WPA, WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN), and various EAP authentication methods. They implement key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator for client stations and controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication and association of the WLAN driver.

Security Fix(es):

* A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit these attacks to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by manipulating cryptographic handshakes used by the WPA2 protocol. (CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13087)

Red Hat would like to thank CERT for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Mathy Vanhoef (University of Leuven) as the original reporter of these issues.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Introduction

We discovered serious weaknesses in WPA2, a protocol that secures all modern protected Wi-Fi networks.
An attacker within range of a victim can exploit these weaknesses using key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs).
Concretely, attackers can use this novel attack technique to read information that was previously assumed to be safely encrypted.
This can be abused to steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, emails, photos, and so on.
**The attack works against all modern protected Wi-Fi networks**.
Depending on the network configuration, it is also possible to inject and manipulate data.
For example, an attacker might be able to inject ransomware or other malware into websites.

The weaknesses are in the Wi-Fi standard itself, and not in individual products or implementations.
Therefore, any correct implementation of WPA2 is likely affected.
To prevent the attack, users must update affected products as soon as security updates become available.
Note that **if your device supports Wi-Fi, it is most likely affected**.
During our initial research, we discovered ourselves that Android, Linux, Apple, Windows, OpenBSD, MediaTek, Linksys, and others, are all affected by some variant of the attacks.
For more information about specific products, consult the [database of CERT/CC](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byvendor?searchview&Query=FIELD+Reference=228519&SearchOrder=4), or contact your vendor.

The research behind the attack will be presented at the [Computer and Communications Security (CCS)](https://acmccs.github.io/session-F3/) conference, and at the [Black Hat Europe](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-17/briefings/schedule/#key-reinstallation-attacks-breaking-the-wpa2-protocol-8861) conference. Our [detailed research paper](#paper) can already be downloaded.

**Update October 2018**: [we have a follow-up paper](followup.html) where we generalize attacks,
analyze more handshakes,
bypass Wi-Fi's official defense,
audit patches,
and enhance attacks using implementation-specific bugs.

## Demonstration

As a proof-of-concept we executed a key reinstallation attack against an Android smartphone.
In this demonstration, the attacker is able to decrypt all data that the victim transmits.
For an attacker this is easy to accomplish, because our key reinstallation attack is exceptionally devastating against Linux and Android 6.0 or higher.
This is because **Android and Linux can be tricked into (re)installing an all-zero encryption key** ([see below for more info](#details-android)).
When attacking other devices, it is harder to decrypt all packets, although a large number of packets can nevertheless be decrypted.
In any case, the following demonstration highlights the type of information that an attacker can obtain when performing key reinstallation attacks against protected Wi-Fi networks:

Our attack is not limited to recovering login credentials (i.e. e-mail addresses and passwords).
In general, any data or information that the victim transmits can be decrypted. Additionally, depending on the device being used and the network setup, it is also possible to decrypt data sent towards the victim (e.g. the content of a website).
Although websites or apps may use HTTPS as an additional layer of protection, we warn that this extra protection can (still) be bypassed in a worrying number of situations.

For example, HTTPS was previously bypassed in [non-browser software](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/48fc/8f1aa0b6d1e4266b8017820ff8770fb67b6f.pdf),
in [Apple's iOS and OS X](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html),
in [Android apps](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/android-apps-still-suffer-game-over-https-defects-7-months-later/),
in [Android apps again](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1505/1505.00589.pdf),
in [banking apps](https://blog.ioactive.com/2014/01/personal-banking-apps-leak-info-through.html),
and even in [VPN apps](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/majority-of-android-vpns-cant-be-trusted-to-make-users-more-secure/).

## Details

Our main attack is against the 4-way handshake of the WPA2 protocol.
This handshake is executed when a client wants to join a protected Wi-Fi network, and is used to confirm that both the client and access point possess the correct credentials (e.g. the pre-shared password of the network).
At the same time, the 4-way handshake also negotiates a fresh encryption key that will be used to encrypt all subsequent traffic.
Currently, all modern protected Wi-Fi networks use the 4-way handshake.
This implies all these networks are affected by (some variant of) our attack.
For instance, the attack works against personal and enterprise Wi-Fi networks, against the older WPA and the latest WPA2 standard, and even against networks that only use AES.

**All our attacks against WPA2 use a novel technique called a key reinstallation attack (KRACK):**

### Key reinstallation attacks: high level description

In a key reinstallation attack, the adversary tricks a victim into reinstalling an already-in-use key.
This is **achieved by manipulating and replaying cryptographic handshake messages**.
When the victim reinstalls the key, associated parameters such as the incremental transmit packet number (i.e. nonce) and receive packet number (i.e. replay counter) are reset to their initial value.
Essentially, to guarantee security, a key should only be installed and used once.
Unfortunately, we found this is not guaranteed by the WPA2 protocol.
By manipulating cryptographic handshakes, we can abuse this weakness in practice.

### Key reinstallation attacks: concrete example against the 4-way handshake

As described in the [introduction of the research paper](#paper), the idea behind a key reinstallation attack can be summarized as follows.
When a client joins a network, it executes the 4-way handshake to negotiate a fresh encryption key.
It will install this key after receiving message 3 of the 4-way handshake.
Once the key is installed, it will be used to encrypt normal data frames using an encryption protocol.
However, because messages may be lost or dropped, the Access Point (AP) will retransmit message 3 if it did not receive an appropriate response as acknowledgment.
As a result, the client may receive message 3 multiple times.
Each time it receives this message, it will reinstall the same encryption key, and thereby reset the incremental transmit packet number (nonce) and receive replay counter used by the encryption protocol.
We show that **an attacker can force these nonce resets by collecting and replaying retransmissions of message 3 of the 4-way handshake**.
By forcing nonce reuse in this manner, the encryption protocol can be attacked, e.g., packets can be replayed, decrypted, and/or forged.
The same technique can also be used to attack the group key, PeerKey, TDLS, and fast BSS transition handshake.

### Practical impact

In our opinion, the most widespread and practically impactful attack is the key reinstallation attack against the 4-way handshake.
We base this judgement on two observations.
First, during our own research we found that most clients were affected by it.
Second, adversaries can use this attack to decrypt packets sent by clients, allowing them to intercept sensitive information such as passwords or cookies.
Decryption of packets is possible because a key reinstallation attack causes the transmit nonces (sometimes also called packet numbers or initialization vectors) to be reset to their initial value.
As a result, **the same encryption key is used with nonce values that have already been used in the past**.
In turn, this causes all encryption protocols of WPA2 to reuse [keystream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystream) when encrypting packets.
In case a message that reuses keystream has known content, it becomes trivial to derive the used keystream.
This keystream can then be used to decrypt messages with the same nonce.
When there is no known content, it is harder to decrypt packets, although still possible in several cases (e.g. [English text can still be decrypted](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/2250)).

In practice, finding packets with known content is not a problem, so it should be assumed that any packet can be decrypted.

The ability to decrypt packets can be used to decrypt TCP SYN packets.
This allows an adversary to obtain the TCP sequence numbers of a connection, and [hijack TCP connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_sequence_prediction_attack).
As a result, even though WPA2 is used, the adversary can now perform one of the most common attacks against open Wi-Fi networks: injecting malicious data into unencrypted HTTP connections.
For example, an attacker can abuse this to inject ransomware or malware into websites that the victim is visiting.

If the victim uses either the WPA-TKIP or GCMP encryption protocol, instead of AES-CCMP, the impact is especially catastrophic.
**Against these encryption protocols, nonce reuse enables an adversary to not only decrypt, but also to forge and inject packets**.
Moreover, because GCMP uses the same authentication key in both communication directions, and this key can be recovered if nonces are reused, it is especially affected.
Note that support for GCMP is currently being rolled out under the name Wireless Gigabit (WiGig), and is expected to be [adopted at a high rate](http://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-wireless-gigabit-wigig-market) over the next few years.

The direction in which packets can be decrypted (and possibly forged) depends on the handshake being attacked.
Simplified, when attacking the 4-way handshake, we can decrypt (and forge) packets sent *by* the client.
When attacking the Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake, we can decrypt (and forge) packets sent *towards* the client.
Finally, most of our attacks also allow the replay of unicast, broadcast, and multicast frames.
For further details, see Section 6 of [our research paper](#paper).

Note that our attacks **do not recover the password of the Wi-Fi network**. They also do not recover (any parts of) the fresh encryption key that is negotiated during the 4-way handshake.

### Android and Linux

Our attack is especially catastrophic against version 2.4 and above of wpa\_supplicant, a Wi-Fi client commonly used on Linux.
Here, the client will install an all-zero encryption key instead of reinstalling the real key.
This vulnerability appears to be caused by a remark in the Wi-Fi standard that suggests to clear the encryption key from memory once it has been installed for the first time.
When the client now receives a retransmitted message 3 of the 4-way handshake, it will reinstall the now-cleared encryption key, effectively installing an all-zero key.
Because Android uses wpa\_supplicant, Android 6.0 and above also contains this vulnerability.
This makes it **trivial to intercept and manipulate traffic sent by these Linux and Android devices**.

Note that currently [50% of Android devices](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) are vulnerable to this exceptionally devastating variant of our attack.

### Assigned CVE identifiers

Note that each CVE identifier represents a specific instantiation of a key reinstallation attack. This means each CVE ID describes a specific protocol vulnerability, and therefore **many vendors are affected by each individual CVE ID**. You can also read [vulnerability note VU#228519](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/228519) of CERT/CC for additional details on which products are known to be affected.

## Paper

Our research paper behind the attack is titled [Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2](https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/ccs2017.pdf) and will be presented at the [Computer and Communications Security (CCS)](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2017/) conference on [Wednesday 1 November 2017](https://acmccs.github.io/session-F3/).

Although this paper is made public now, it was already submitted for review on 19 May 2017.
After this, only minor changes were made.
As a result, the findings in the paper are already several months old.
In the meantime, we have found easier techniques to carry out our key reinstallation attack against the 4-way handshake.
With our novel attack technique, it is now trivial to exploit implementations that only accept encrypted retransmissions of message 3 of the 4-way handshake.
In particular this means that **attacking macOS and OpenBSD is significantly easier than discussed in the paper**.

We would like to highlight the following addendums and errata:

### Addendum: wpa\_supplicant v2.6 and Android 6.0+

Linux's wpa\_supplicant v2.6 is also vulnerable to the installation of an all-zero encryption key in the 4-way handshake.
This was discovered by John A. Van Boxtel.
As a result, all Android versions higher than 6.0 are also affected by the attack, and hence can be tricked into installing an all-zero encryption key.
The new attack works by injecting a forged message 1, with the same ANonce as used in the original message 1, before forwarding the retransmitted message 3 to the victim.

### Addendum: other vulnerable handshakes

After our initial research as reported in the paper, we discovered that the TDLS handshake and WNM Sleep Mode Response frame are also vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks.

### Selected errata

* In Figure 9 at stage 3 of the attack, the frame transmitted from the adversary to the authenticator should say "ReassoReq(ANonce, SNonce, MIC)" instead of "ReassoResp(..)".
* Section 3.1: figure 3 contains a simplified description of the state machine (not figure 2).
* Section 4.2: "It is essential that the broadcast frame we replay is sent **after** (not before) the retransmission of group message 1". A similar change should be made in Section 4.3: "Again it is essential that the broadcast frame we want to replay is sent **after** (not before) the retransmission of group message 1".

## Tools

We have made scripts to detect whether an implementation of the 4-way handshake, group key handshake, or Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake is vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks.
[These scripts are available on github](https://github.com/vanhoefm/krackattacks-scripts), and contain detailed instructions on how to use them.

We also made a proof-of-concept script that exploits the all-zero key (re)installation present in certain Android and Linux devices.
This script is the one that we used in the [demonstration video](#demo).
It will be released once everyone has had a reasonable chance to update their devices (and we have had a chance to prepare the code repository for release).
We remark that the reliability of our proof-of-concept script may depend on how close the victim is to the real network.
If the victim is very close to the real network, the script may fail because the victim will always directly communicate with the real network, even if the victim is (forced) onto a different Wi-Fi channel than this network.

### Is there a higher resolution version of the logo?

[Yes there is](images/logo.png). And a big thank you goes to [Darlee Urbiztondo](https://www.behance.net/happyleedesigns) for conceptualizing and designing the logo!

### Do we now need WPA3?

No, luckily **implementations can be patched in a backwards-compatible manner**.
This means a patched client can still communicate with an unpatched access point (AP), and vice versa.
In other words, a patched client or access point sends exactly the same handshake messages as before, and at exactly the same moment in time.
However, the security updates will assure a key is only installed once, preventing our attack.
So again, update all your devices once security updates are available.
Finally, although an unpatched client can still connect to a patched AP, and vice versa, *both* the client and AP must be patched to defend against all attacks!

### Should I change my Wi-Fi password?

Changing the password of your Wi-Fi network does not prevent (or mitigate) the attack. So you do not have to update the password of your Wi-Fi network. Instead, you should make sure all your devices are updated, and you should also update the firmware of your router. Nevertheless, after updating both your client devices and your router, it's never a bad idea to change the Wi-Fi password.

### I'm using WPA2 with only AES. That's also vulnerable?

Yes, that network configuration is also vulnerable. The attack works against both WPA1 and WPA2, against personal and enterprise networks, and against any cipher suite being used (WPA-TKIP, AES-CCMP, and GCMP). So everyone should update their devices to prevent the attack!

### You use the word "we" in this website. Who is we?

I use the word "we" because that's what I'm used to writing in papers. In practice, all the work is done by me, with me being Mathy Vanhoef.
My awesome supervisor is added under an [honorary authorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_authorship#Honorary_authorship) to the research paper for his excellent general guidance.
But all the real work was done on my own.
So the [author list](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=562) of academic papers does not represent [division of work](https://imgur.com/a/mKnnu) :)

### Is my device vulnerable?

Probably. Any device that uses Wi-Fi is likely vulnerable. Contact your vendor for more information, or consult [this community maintained list on GitHub](https://github.com/kristate/krackinfo).

### What if there are no security updates for my router or access point? Or if it does not support 802.11r?

Routers or access points (APs) are only vulnerable to our attack if they support the Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake, or if they support client (repeater) functionality.
First, the FT handshake is part of 802.11r, and is mainly supported by enterprise networks, and not by home routers or APs.
Additionally, most home routers or APs do not support (or will not use) client functionality.
In other words, your home router or AP likely does not require security updates.
Instead, it are mainly enterprise networks that will have to update their network infrastructure (i.e. their routers and access points).

That said, some vendors discovered implementation-specific security issues while investigating our attack.
For example, it was discovered that [hostapd reuses the ANonce value](https://w1.fi/security/2017-1/wpa-packet-number-reuse-with-replayed-messages.txt) in the 4-way handshake during rekeys.
Concretely this means that, even if your router or AP does not support 802.11r, and even if it does not support client functionality, it might still have to be updated.
Contact your vendor for more details.

Finally, we remark that you can try to mitigate attacks against routers and APs by disabling client functionality (which is for example used in repeater modes) and disabling 802.11r (fast roaming).
Additionally, update all your other client devices such as laptops and smartphones.
If one or more of your client devices is not receiving updates, you can also try to contact your router's vendor and ask if they have an [update that prevents attacks against connected devices](#ap-mitigations).

### Is it sufficient to patch only the access point? Or to patch only clients?

Currently, all vulnerable devices should be patched.
In other words, patching the AP will not prevent attacks against vulnerable clients.
Similarly, patching all clients will not prevent attacks against vulnerable access points.
Note that only access points that support the Fast BSS Transition handshake (802.11r) can be vulnerable.

That said, it is possible to [modify the access point such that vulnerable clients (when connected to this AP) cannot be attacked](#ap-mitigations).
However, these modifications are different from the normal security patches that are being released for vulnerable access points!
So unless your access point vendor explicitly mentions that their patches prevent attacks against clients, you must also patch clients.

### Can we modify an access point to prevent attacks against the client?

It's possible to modify the access point (router) such that connected clients are not vulnerable to attacks against the 4-way handshake and group key handshake.
Note that we consider these two attacks the most serious and widespread security issues we discovered.
However, these modifications only prevent attacks when a vulnerable client is connected to such a modified access point.
When a vulnerable client connects to a different access point, it can still be attacked.

Technically, this is accomplished by modifying the access point such that it does not retransmit message 3 of the 4-way handshake.
Additionally, the access point is modified to not retransmit message 1 of the group key handshake.
The [hostapd project has such a modification available](https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=6f234c1e2ee1ede29f2412b7012b3345ed8e52d3).
They are currently evaluating to which extend this impacts the reliability of these handshakes.
We remark that the client-side attacks against the 4-way handshake and group key handshake can also be prevented by retransmitting the above handshake messages using the same (previous) EAPOL-Key replay counter.
The attack against the group key handshake can also be prevented by letting the access point install the group key in a delayed fashion, and by assuring the access point only accepts the latest replay counter (see [section 4.3 of the paper](#paper) for details).

On some products, variants or generalizations of the above mitigations can be enabled without having to update products.

For example, on some access points retransmissions of all handshake messages can be disabled, preventing client-side attacks against the 4-way and group key handshake ([see for example Cisco](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171016-wpa#workarounds)).

### How did you discover these vulnerabilities?

When working on the final (i.e. camera-ready) version of [another paper](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/572634/1/asiaccs2017.pdf), I was double-checking some claims we made regarding OpenBSD's implementation of the 4-way handshake. In a sense I was slacking off, because I was supposed to be just finishing the paper, instead of staring at code. But there I was, inspecting some code I already read a hundred times, to avoid having to work on the next paragraph. It was at that time that a particular call to [ic\_set\_key](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/ca7fda7e2ae9fcf15b882d71bc910143e6b0d09b/sys/net80211/ieee80211_pae_input.c#L519) caught my attention. This function is called when processing message 3 of the 4-way handshake, and it installs the pairwise key to the driver. While staring at that line of code I thought *“Ha. I wonder what happens if that function is called twice”*. At the time I (correctly) guessed that calling it twice might reset the nonces associated to the key. And since message 3 can be retransmitted by the Access Point, in practice it might indeed be called twice. *“Better make a note of that. Other vendors might also call such a function twice. But let's first finish this paper...”*. A few weeks later, after finishing the paper and completing some other work, I investigated this new idea in more detail. And the rest is history.

### The 4-way handshake was mathematically proven as secure. How is your attack possible?

The brief answer is that the formal proof does not assure a key is installed only once. Instead, it merely assures the negotiated key remains secret, and that handshake messages cannot be forged.

The longer answer is mentioned in [the introduction of our research paper](#paper): our attacks do not violate the security properties proven in formal analysis of the 4-way handshake.
In particular, these proofs state that the negotiated encryption key remains private, and that the identity of both the client and Access Point (AP) is confirmed.
Our attacks do not leak the encryption key.
Additionally, although normal data frames can be forged if TKIP or GCMP is used, an attacker cannot forge handshake messages and hence cannot impersonate the client or AP during handshakes.
Therefore, the properties that were proven in formal analysis of the 4-way handshake remain true.
However, the problem is that the proofs do not model key installation.
Put differently, the formal models did not define when a negotiated key should be installed.
In practice, this means the same key can be installed multiple times, thereby resetting nonces and replay counters used by the encryption protocol (e.g. by WPA-TKIP or AES-CCMP).

### Some attacks in the paper seem hard

We have follow-up work making our attacks (against macOS and OpenBSD for example) significantly more general and easier to execute.
So although we agree that some of the attack scenarios in the paper are rather impractical, do not let this fool you into believing key reinstallation attacks cannot be abused in practice.

### If an attacker can do a man-in-the-middle attack, why can't they just decrypt all the data?

As mentioned in the demonstration, the attacker first obtains a man-in-the-middle (MitM) position between the victim and the real Wi-Fi network (called a [channel-based MitM position](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/473761/1/acsac2014.pdf)).
However, this MitM position does not enable the attacker to decrypt packets!
This position only allows the attacker to reliably delay, block, or replay *encrypted* packets.
So at this point in the attack, they cannot yet decrypt packets.
Instead, the ability to reliably delay and block packets is used to execute a key reinstallation attack.
After performing a key reinstallation attack, packets can be decrypted.

### Does an attacker to have be near your network in order to attack it?

An adversary has to be within range of both the client being attacked (meaning the smartphone or laptop) and the network itself.
This means an adversary on the other side of the world cannot attack you remotely.
However, the attacker can still be relatively far way.
That's because special antenna can be used to carry out the attack from [two miles](https://www.mattparkinson.eu/designer-cantenna/) to up to [eight miles](https://leaksource.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/nsa-ant-nightstand.jpg?w=604&h=781) in ideal conditions.
Additionally, the attacker is not competing with the signal strength of the real Wi-Fi network, but instead uses so-called Channel Switch Announcements to manipulate and attack the client.
As a result, it is possible to successfully carry out attacks even when far away from the victim.

### Are people exploiting this in the wild?

We are not in a position to determine if this vulnerability has been (or is being) actively exploited in the wild. That said, key reinstallations can actually occur spontaneously without an adversary being present! This may for example happen if the last message of a handshake is lost due to background noise, causing a retransmission of the previous message. When processing this retransmitted message, keys may be reinstalled, resulting in nonce reuse just like in a real attack.

### Should I temporarily use WEP until my devices are patched?

**NO!** Keep using WPA2.

### Will the Wi-Fi standard be updated to address this?

There seems to be an agreement that the Wi-Fi standard should be updated to explicitly prevent our attacks.
These updates likely will be backwards-compatible with older implementations of WPA2.
Time will tell whether and how the standard will be updated.

### Is the Wi-Fi Alliance also addressing these vulnerabilities?

For those unfamiliar with Wi-Fi, the [Wi-Fi Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance) is an organization which certifies that Wi-Fi devices conform to certain standards of interoperability. Among other things, this assures that Wi-Fi products from different vendors work well together.

[The Wi-Fi Alliance has a plan](https://www.wi-fi.org/securityupdate2017) to help remedy the discovered vulnerabilities in WPA2. Summarized, they will:

* Require testing for this vulnerability within their global certification lab network.
* Provide a vulnerability detection tool for use by any Wi-Fi Alliance member (this tool is based on my own detection tool that determines if a device is vulnerable to some of the discovered key reinstallation attacks).
* Broadly communicate details on this vulnerability, including remedies, to device vendors. Additionally, vendors are encouraged to work with their solution providers to rapidly integrate any necessary patches.
* Communicate the importance for users to ensure they have installed the latest recommended security updates from device manufacturers.

### Why did you use match.com as an example in the demonstration video?

Users share a lot of personal information on websites such as match.com. So this example highlights all the sensitive information an attacker can obtain, and hopefully with this example people also better realize the potential (personal) impact. We also hope this example makes people aware of [all the information these dating websites may be collecting](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold).

### How can these types of bugs be prevented?

We need more rigorous inspections of protocol implementations. This requires help and additional research from the academic community! Together with other researchers, we hope to organize workshop(s) to improve and verify the correctness of security protocol implementations.

### Why the domain name krackattacks.com?

First, I'm aware that KRACK attacks is a [pleonasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleonasm), since KRACK stands for key reinstallation attack and hence already contains the word attack. But the domain name rhymes, so that's why it's used.

### Did you get bug bounties for this?

Hackerone has awarded a bug bounty for our research under their Internet Bug Bounty (IBB) award program.

### How does this attack compare to other attacks against WPA2?

This is the first attack against the WPA2 protocol that doesn't rely on password guessing. Indeed, other attacks against WPA2-enabled network are against surrounding technologies such as [Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)](http://archive.hack.lu/2014/Hacklu2014_offline_bruteforce_attack_on_wps.pdf), or are attacks against older standards such as [WPA-TKIP](http://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/asiaccs2013.pdf). Put differently, none of the existing attacks were against the 4-way handshake or against cipher suites defined in the WPA2 protocol. In contrast, our key reinstallation attack against the 4-way handshake (and against other handshakes) highlights vulnerabilities in the WPA2 protocol itself.

### Are other protocols also affected by key reinstallation attacks?

We expect that certain *implementations of other protocols* may be vulnerable to similar attacks. So it's a good idea to audit security protocol implementations with this attack in mind. However, we consider it unlikely that other *protocol standards* are affected by similar attacks (or at least so we hope). Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to audit other protocols!

### When did you first notify vendors about the vulnerability?

We sent out notifications to vendors whose products we tested ourselves around 14 July 2017. After communicating with these vendors, we realized how widespread the weaknesses we discovered are (only then did I *truly* convince myself it was indeed a protocol weaknesses and not a set of implementation bugs). At that point, we decided to let [CERT/CC](https://cert.org/) help with the disclosure of the vulnerabilities. In turn, CERT/CC sent out a broad notification to vendors on 28 August 2017.

### Why did OpenBSD silently release a patch before the embargo?

OpenBSD [announced an errata on 30 August 2017](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-announce&m=150410604407872&w=2) that silently prevented our key reinstallation attacks.
More specifically, patches were released for both [OpenBSD 6.0](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/6.0/common/041_net80211_replay.patch.sig) and [OpenBSD 6.1](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/6.1/common/027_net80211_replay.patch.sig).

We notified OpenBSD of the vulnerability on 15 July 2017, before CERT/CC was involved in the coordination. Quite quickly, Theo de Raadt replied and critiqued the tentative disclosure deadline: *“In the open source world, if a person writes a diff and has to sit on it for a month, that is very discouraging”*. Note that I wrote and included a suggested diff for OpenBSD already, and that at the time the tentative disclosure deadline was around the end of August. As a compromise, I allowed them to silently patch the vulnerability. In hindsight this was a bad decision, since others might rediscover the vulnerability by inspecting their silent patch. To avoid this problem in the future, OpenBSD will now receive vulnerability notifications closer to the end of an embargo.

An update that fixes 6 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for wpa\_supplicant fixes the security issues:
- Several vulnerabilities in standard conforming implementations of the
WPA2 protocol have been discovered and published under the code name
KRACK. This update remedies those issues in a backwards compatible
manner, i.e. the updated wpa\_supplicant can interface properly with both
vulnerable and patched implementations of WPA2, but an attacker won't be
able to exploit the KRACK weaknesses in those connections anymore even
if the other party is still vulnerable. [bsc#1056061, CVE-2017-13078,

## Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) handshake traffic can be manipulated to induce nonce and session key reuse

#### Vulnerability Note VU#228519

Original Release Date: 2017-10-16 | Last Revised: 2017-11-16

---

### Overview

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, more commonly WPA2) handshake traffic can be manipulated to induce nonce and session key reuse, resulting in key reinstallation by a wireless access point (AP) or client. An attacker within range of an affected AP and client may leverage these vulnerabilities to conduct attacks that are dependent on the data confidentiality protocols being used. Attacks may include arbitrary packet decryption and injection, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, or the replay of unicast and group-addressed frames. These vulnerabilities are referred to as Key Reinstallation Attacks or "KRACK" attacks.

### Description

| [**CWE-323**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/323.html)**: Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption**  Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) handshake traffic can be manipulated to induce nonce and session key reuse, resulting in key reinstallation by a victim wireless access point (AP) or client. After establishing a man-in-the-middle position between an AP and client, an attacker can selectively manipulate the timing and transmission of messages in the WPA2 Four-way, Group Key, Fast Basic Service Set (BSS) Transition, PeerKey, Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey (TPK), or Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode handshakes, resulting in out-of-sequence reception or retransmission of messages. Depending on the data confidentiality protocols in use (e.g. TKIP, CCMP, and GCMP) and situational factors, the effect of these manipulations is to reset nonces and replay counters and ultimately to reinstall session keys. Key reuse facilitates arbitrary packet decryption and injection, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, or the replay of unicast, broadcast, and multicast frames.The following CVE IDs have been assigned to document these vulnerabilities in the WPA2 protocol:     + CVE-2017-13077: reinstallation of the pairwise key in the Four-way handshake + CVE-2017-13078: reinstallation of the group key in the Four-way handshake + CVE-2017-13079: reinstallation of the integrity group key in the Four-way handshake + CVE-2017-13080: reinstallation of the group key in the Group Key handshake + CVE-2017-13081: reinstallation of the integrity group key in the Group Key handshake + CVE-2017-13082: accepting a retransmitted Fast BSS Transition Reassociation Request and reinstalling the pairwise key while processing it + CVE-2017-13084: reinstallation of the STK key in the PeerKey handshake + CVE-2017-13086: reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey (TPK) key in the TDLS handshake + CVE-2017-13087: reinstallation of the group key (GTK) when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame + CVE-2017-13088: reinstallation of the integrity group key (IGTK) when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame  For a detailed description of these issues, refer to the researcher's [website](https://www.krackattacks.com/) and [paper](https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/ccs2017.pdf). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker within the wireless communications range of an affected AP and client may leverage these vulnerabilities to conduct attacks that are dependent on the data confidentiality protocol being used. Impacts may include arbitrary packet decryption and injection, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, or the replay of unicast, broadcast, and multicast frames. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install Updates**The WPA2 protocol is ubiquitous in wireless networking. The vulnerabilities described here are in the standard itself as opposed to individual implementations thereof; as such, any correct implementation is likely affected. Users are encouraged to install updates to affected products and hosts as they are available. For information about a specific vendor or product, check the Vendor Information section of this document or contact the vendor directly. Note that the vendor list below is not exhaustive. |

### Vendor Statement

10/18/2017 **Security advisory for the vulnerabilities of WPA2 protocol**

ASUS is aware of the recent WPA2 vulnerability issue. We take your security and privacy seriously and are currently working towards a full solution as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we want to help clarify the severity of the potential threat, and let our valued customers know the appropriate steps to take in order to avoid or lessen the threat of being compromised.

Your devices are only vulnerable if an attacker is in physical proximity to your wireless network and is able to gain access to it. This exploit cannot steal your banking information, passwords, or other data on a secured connection that utilizes proper end-to-end encryption. However, an attacker could capture and read this information on an unsecured connection via an exploited WiFi network. Depending on the network configuration, it is also possible for the attacker to redirect network traffic, send invalid data to devices or even inject malware into the network.

We are feverishly working with chipset suppliers to resolve this vulnerability and will release patched firmware for affected routers in the near future. Before this patched firmware is released, here are a few cautions all users should take:

(1) Avoid public Wi-Fi and Hotspots until the routers and your devices are updated. Use cellular network connections if possible.
(2) Only connect to secured services that you trust or have been verified. Web pages that use HTTPS or another secure connection will include HTTPS in the URL. If the connection is secured using TLS 1.2 your activities with that service is safe for now.
(3) Keep your operating system and antivirus software up-to-date. Microsoft recently updated Windows to fix this exploit on their latest operating systems. Google and Apple are following suit shortly.
(4) When in doubt, be safe and use your cellular network or a wired connection (Ethernet) to access the internet. This exploit only affects 802.11 traffic between a Wi-Fi router and a connected device on an exploited WiFi connection.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### [Barracuda Networks](#CHEU-AQNMXH) Affected

Notified:  August 28, 2017  Updated: October 24, 2017

**Statement Date:   October 19, 2017**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

On October 16th, 2017, a research paper with the title of "Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2" was made publicly available. This paper discusses seven vulnerabilities affecting session key negotiation in both the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocols. These vulnerabilities may allow the reinstallation of a pairwise transient key, a group key, or an integrity key on either a wireless client or a wireless access point. Additional research also led to the discovery of three additional vulnerabilities (not discussed in the original paper) affecting wireless supplicant supporting either the 802.11z (Extensions to Direct-Link Setup) standard or the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) standard. The three additional vulnerabilities could also allow the reinstallation of a pairwise key, group key, or integrity group key.

### Vendor Statement

On October 16th, researchers disclosed security vulnerabilities in the widely used standard for Wi-Fi security WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) that make it possible for attackers to eavesdrop on Wi-Fi traffic. D-Link has immediately taken actions to investigate this matter. This security concern appears to be an industry-wide issue that will require firmware patches to be provided from the relevant semiconductor chipset manufacturers.

D-Link has requested assistance from the chipset manufacturers. As soon as the firmware patches are received from the chipset manufacturers, we will post them on our websites immediately. Please take the following important actions to help protect your privacy:

### Vendor Statement

Our products ESP8266 and ESP32 are affected by the vulnerability identified as VU#228519.

For ESP32, we have made remediation in ESP-IDF v2.1.1 on Github. ESP32 which uses ESP-IDF v2.1.1 or later than v2.1.1 will not be affected by this vulnerability.

For ESP8266, we have updated both RTOS SDK and NONOS SDK on Github on October 13, 2017. ESP8266 which uses RTOS SDK or NONOS SDK after October 13, 2017 will not be affected by this vulnerability.

We strongly recommend that users update their ESP-IDF, ESP8266 RTOS SDK and ESP8266 NONOS SDK to the latest version to avoid being affected by this vulnerability.

For ESP8089 and ESP8689, the supplicant protocol runs on the host side. So, whether they are affected by this vulnerability depends on which host is used. But we also recommend that users update their host to fix this vulnerability.

The updates of ESP-IDF, ESP8266 RTOS SDK and ESP8266 NONOS SDK can be found on the following website:
ESP-IDF: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>
ESP8266 RTOS SDK: <https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK>

### [Technicolor](#JLAD-AS9JHN) Affected

Updated:  October 19, 2017

**Statement Date:   October 18, 2017**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

By making use of a model-based approach, researchers from K.U Leuven University have identified several theoretical flaws in the Wi-Fi Protected Acess (WPA) protocol. These weaknesses constitute a new class of attack on the 4-way handshake used in all flavors of WPA/WPA2, named KRACK: Key Reinstallation AttaCK.

This academic research presents an industry-wide issue as all products implementing Wi-Fi are theoretically vulnerable.

In practice, no gateway or modem manufactured by Technicolor, implementing WiFi Access point routing function is affected by this class of attack. This is due to the fact that the vulnerable function allowing practical attack against the Access Point is not present. The end users should continue to use their Technicolor gateway or modem without changing WPA2 settings. In particular, none of these attacks is able to retrieve the WPA private passphrase. This recommendation is also valid for the legacy Thomson and Cisco branded gateways and modems.

The 802.11r standard makes use of a 4-way handshake protocol that was mathematically proven secure by the scientific community. Yet, the research publication exhibits weaknesses in some implementations of this protocol, that can affect the way the client connects to the Access point. For Access Points, the operational impact is very limited. Gateways and modems configured as Wi-Fi Access Point are not potentially concerned, except when supporting Fast BSS Transition handshake introduced with 802.11r standard. Fast BSS Transition handshake is usually not supported on residential gateways and modems, because this feature is intended to minimize roaming time between several access points in a managed network.

Technicolor works constantly to improve security of its products, alongside with the Wi-Fi Alliance. Technicolor remains committed to provide efficient support to its customers and end-users.

Our detailed security bulletins remain reserved for our customers. Customers can contact their Technicolor Customer Technical Support.

**Statement Date:   October 10, 2017**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

On October 16. CERT/CC/ICASI released a public announcement about discovered vulnerabilities in WPA2 handshake protocols that affect most WiFi users and all vendors world wide.

RouterOS v6.39.3, v6.40.4, v6.41rc are not affected!
It is important to note that the vulnerability is discovered in the protocol itself, so even a correct implementation is affected.
These organizations did contact us earlier, so we have already released fixed versions that address the outlined issues. Not all of the discovered vulnerabilities directly impact RouterOS users, or even apply to RouterOS, but we did follow all recommendations and improved the key exchange process according to the guidelines we received from the organizations who discovered the issue.
We released fixed versions last week, so if you upgrade your devices routinely, no further action is required.
CWE-323
CVE-2017-13077
CVE-2017-13078
CVE-2017-13079
CVE-2017-13080
CVE-2017-13081

CVE-2017-13084
CVE-2017-13085
CVE-2017-13086
CVE-2017-13087

The following applies to RouterOS software prior to updates related to the issue.

nv2
nv2 is not affected in any way. This applies to both - nv2 AP and client. There is no nonce reset in key exchange possible and key re-installation is not possible, because nv2 key exchange does not directly follow 802.11 key exchange specification.

802.11 nonce reuse
RouterOS is not affected in any way, RouterOS generates cryptographically strong random initial nonce on boot and never reuses the same nonce during uptime.

802.11 key reinstallation
The device operating as client in key exchange is affected by this issue. This means that RouterOS in station modes and APs that establish WDS links with other APs are affected. RouterOS APs (both - standalone and CAPsMAN controlled), that do not establish WDS links with other APs, are not affected. Key reinstallation by resending key exchange frame allows attacker to reset encrypted frame packet counter. This allows attacker to replay frames that where previously sent by AP to client. Please note that RouterOS DOES NOT reset key to some known value that would allow attacker to inject/decrypt any frames to/from client.

Suggested course of action
It is always recommended to upgrade to latest RouterOS version, but depending on wireless protocol and mode the suggested course of action is as follows:
- nv2: no action necessary
- 802.11/nstreme AP without WDS: no action necessary
- CAPsMAN: no action necessary
- 802.11/nstreme client (all station modes) or AP with WDS: upgrade to fixed version ASAP.

### Vendor Information

Though Mikrotik has self-identified as not affected, they have published updates that "improved WPA2 key exchange reliability" (see <https://mikrotik.com/download/changelogs>).

This paper discusses seven vulnerabilities affecting session key negotiation in both the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocols. These vulnerabilities may allow the reinstallation of a pairwise transient key, a group key, or an integrity key on either a wireless client or a wireless access point. Additional research also led to the discovery of three additional vulnerabilities (not discussed in the original paper) affecting wireless supplicant supporting either the 802.11z (Extensions to Direct-Link Setup) standard or the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) standard. The three additional vulnerabilities could also allow the reinstallation of a pairwise key, group key, or integrity group key.  Affected Products  * Cisco is investigating its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities. As the investigation progresses, Cisco will update this advisory with information about affected products, including the ID of the Cisco bug for each affected product.         For information about whether a product is affected by these vulnerabilities, refer to the [Vulnerable Products](#vulnerable) and [Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable](#notvulnerable) sections of this advisory. The [Vulnerable Products](#vulnerable) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID) and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.

identified by CVE ID CVE-2017-13082 may affect only deployments that support the fast BSS transition (FT) feature and have it enabled. To determine whether the FT feature is enabled on a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) device, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show wlan** command or the **show wlan id** command, depending on the device model.         The following example shows the output of the **show wlan id** command for a Cisco 3500 Series Wireless Controllers device where FT is enabled on *wlan 1*: ```   (w-3504-2)> show wlan 1   ...   Security      802.11 Authentication:........................ Open System      FT Support.................................... Enabled      ...         ``` The following example shows the output of the **show wlan id 1** command for a Cisco 5760 Series Wireless LAN Controller device where FT is disabled on *wlan 1*: ```   W-5760-2> show wlan id 1 | include FT\ Support       FT Support                                 : Disabled      ``` To determine whether the FT feature is enabled on a Standalone Access Point running Cisco IOS Software, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show running-config | include dot11r** command and verify that the command returns output.      The following example shows the output of the **show running-config | include dot11r** command for an access point that has FT enabled: ```   AP# show running-config | include dot11r   authentication key-management wpa version 2 dot11r    ``` Please note that FT is not supported on deployments running a Wireless LAN Controller with AireOS version 7.0 and previous releases, hence such deployments are not affected by CVE-2017-13082.         To determine which release of Cisco WLC Software is running on a device, administrators can use the web interface or the CLI.      To use the web interface, log in to the web interface, click the **Monitor** tab, and then click **Summary** in the left pane. The **Software Version** field shows the release number of the software currently running on the device.      To use the CLI, issue the **show sysinfo** command, and then refer to the value in the **Product Version** field of the command output. The following example shows the output of the command for a device running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.3.102.0:    ```   (5500-4) >show sysinfo   Manufacturer's Name.............................. Cisco Systems Inc.   Product Name.....................................

This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-13088      **Note:** Fixes should be installed on both affected access points and wireless clients for a complete solution. Installing a fixed software release on an affected access point will fix that particular device, but will not prevent exploitation of any vulnerabilities affecting a wireless client. The converse is also true: installing a fix on a wireless client would fix that particular device, but would not prevent exploitation of any vulnerabilities affecting an access point. For a complete solution, both affected wireless access point and wireless clients should be updated, if vulnerable, to a fixed software release.  Workarounds  * Workaround for CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, and CVE-2017-13081Limiting the maximum number of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) over LAN (EAPoL) key retries to **0** has been determined to be a valid workaround for these vulnerabilities. Setting the EAPoL retries value to **0** means one message will be sent, there will be no retransmissions sent, and if the EAPoL timeout is exceeded the client will be removed.      This workaround can be configured at the global level or at the individual wireless LAN (WLAN) level. Please note that the option to configure this workaround at the WLAN level is only available on Cisco WLC releases 7.6 and later. Previous releases only allow configuration at the global (all WLANs) level.      In order to configure this workaround at the global level (for all WLANs), use the following command in the WLC CLI: ```   config advanced eap eapol-key-retries 0      ``` The command **show advanced eap** can be used to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):    ```   (wlc-hostname)> show advanced eap   EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)........... 30   EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries................. 2   EAP Key-Index for Dynamic WEP.................... 0   EAP Max-Login Ignore Identity Response........... enable   EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).................... 30   EAP-Request Max Retries.......................... 2   EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)................. 1000   EAPOL-Key Max Retries............................ 0   EAP-Broadcast Key Interval....................... 120      ```    In order to configure this workaround for a specific WLAN, the following two commands should be entered in the WLC CLI:  ```   config wlan security eap-params enable WLAN-NUMBER   config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 WLAN-NUMBER      ``` Both commands must be entered and *WLAN-NUMBER* should be replaced with the actual WLAN number. In the following example, the workaround is being implemented on WLAN number 24: ```   config wlan security eap-params enable 24   config wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 24      ```    The command **show wlan *WLAN-NUMBER*** (where *WLAN-NUMBER* is replaced with the appropriate WLAN number) can be used then to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):    ```   (wlc-hostname)> show wlan 24   WLAN Identifier.................................. X   Profile Name..................................... ftpsk   Network Name (SSID).............................. ftpsk   .   .   .     Tkip MIC Countermeasure Hold-down Timer....... 60     Eap-params.................................... Enabled        EAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)..... 30        EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries........... 2        EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).............. 30        EAP-Request Max Retries.................... 2        EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)........... 1000        EAPOL-Key Max Retries...................... 0      ```    **Note**: Implementing the previous workaround may have a negative impact on normal wireless client association to the access point in the following scenarios:   + Clients that are slow or may drop initial processing of EAPoL message number 1 (M1). This is seen on some embedded/CPU-limited clients, which may receive the M1 and not be ready to process it after the 802.1x authentication phase.   + Environments with RF (Radio Frequency) interference or a WAN connection between the access point (AP) and the WLC, which may result in packet drops at some point on transmission towards clients.In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.Workaround for CVE-2017-13082For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (*Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It*), the workaround is as follows:   + If no interactive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video are being used on the network, you can disable 11r support on the access point.   + If VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones), you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.**Note**: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.         No workarounds have been identified for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, or CVE-2017-13088. Any future workarounds that address these vulnerabilities will be documented in the respective Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID).  Fixed Software  * Updates for affected software releases will be published when they are available and information about those updates will be documented in Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID).    When Cisco releases software updates that address these vulnerabilities, customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html)  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

#### Summary

Multiple security issues and vulnerabilities within the WPA2 standard have been identified and publicized by Mr. Mathy Vanhoef of KU Leuven. These vulnerabilities may allow the reinstallation of a pairwise transient key, a group key, or an integrity key on either a wireless client or a wireless access point (AP). In consequence, an attacker could establish a man-in-the-middle position between AP and client facilitating packet decryption and injection.

ecom instruments is a subsidiary company of PEPPERL+FUCHS.

#### Impact

ecom instruments devices are in theory attackable by replay, decryption and forging of packets. However, to perform the attack, the attacker must be significantly closer to the ecom device than to the access point. The WPA2 password cannot be compromised using a KRACK attack. Note if WPA-TKIP is used instead of AES-CCMP, an attacker can easily forge and inject packets directly into the WLAN.

#### Solution

****23.10.2018, Update A:****Firmware for Android based devices now available

**Android**

**Affected Products:**Tab-Ex 01, Ex-Handy 09, Ex-Handy 209, Smart-Ex 01, Smart-Ex 201

Pepperl+Fuchs has released firmware updates for the following products

| **Product** | **Date** | **Updatesource** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smart-Ex 01 | Available since 09/2018 | FOTA-Update |
| Smart-Ex 201 | Available since 10/2018 | FOTA-Update |

**Windows**

**Affected Products:** Pad-Ex 01, i.roc Ci70-Ex, CK70A-ATEX, CK71A-ATEX, CN70A-ATEX, CN70E-ATEX

For ecom instruments devices running Windows, we recommend to apply the security update provided by Microsoft. If you are using WPA-TKIP in your WLAN, you should switch to AES-CCMP immediately.

**Note**

This advisory will be updated as further details and/or software updates become available.

## Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) handshake traffic can be manipulated to induce nonce and session key reuse

#### Vulnerability Note VU#228519

Original Release Date: 2017-10-16 | Last Revised: 2017-11-16

---

### Overview

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, more commonly WPA2) handshake traffic can be manipulated to induce nonce and session key reuse, resulting in key reinstallation by a wireless access point (AP) or client. An attacker within range of an affected AP and client may leverage these vulnerabilities to conduct attacks that are dependent on the data confidentiality protocols being used. Attacks may include arbitrary packet decryption and injection, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, or the replay of unicast and group-addressed frames. These vulnerabilities are referred to as Key Reinstallation Attacks or "KRACK" attacks.

### Description

| [**CWE-323**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/323.html)**: Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption**  Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) handshake traffic can be manipulated to induce nonce and session key reuse, resulting in key reinstallation by a victim wireless access point (AP) or client. After establishing a man-in-the-middle position between an AP and client, an attacker can selectively manipulate the timing and transmission of messages in the WPA2 Four-way, Group Key, Fast Basic Service Set (BSS) Transition, PeerKey, Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey (TPK), or Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode handshakes, resulting in out-of-sequence reception or retransmission of messages. Depending on the data confidentiality protocols in use (e.g. TKIP, CCMP, and GCMP) and situational factors, the effect of these manipulations is to reset nonces and replay counters and ultimately to reinstall session keys. Key reuse facilitates arbitrary packet decryption and injection, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, or the replay of unicast, broadcast, and multicast frames.The following CVE IDs have been assigned to document these vulnerabilities in the WPA2 protocol:     + CVE-2017-13077: reinstallation of the pairwise key in the Four-way handshake + CVE-2017-13078: reinstallation of the group key in the Four-way handshake + CVE-2017-13079: reinstallation of the integrity group key in the Four-way handshake + CVE-2017-13080: reinstallation of the group key in the Group Key handshake + CVE-2017-13081: reinstallation of the integrity group key in the Group Key handshake + CVE-2017-13082: accepting a retransmitted Fast BSS Transition Reassociation Request and reinstalling the pairwise key while processing it + CVE-2017-13084: reinstallation of the STK key in the PeerKey handshake + CVE-2017-13086: reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey (TPK) key in the TDLS handshake + CVE-2017-13087: reinstallation of the group key (GTK) when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame + CVE-2017-13088: reinstallation of the integrity group key (IGTK) when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame  For a detailed description of these issues, refer to the researcher's [website](https://www.krackattacks.com/) and [paper](https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/ccs2017.pdf). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker within the wireless communications range of an affected AP and client may leverage these vulnerabilities to conduct attacks that are dependent on the data confidentiality protocol being used. Impacts may include arbitrary packet decryption and injection, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, or the replay of unicast, broadcast, and multicast frames. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install Updates**The WPA2 protocol is ubiquitous in wireless networking. The vulnerabilities described here are in the standard itself as opposed to individual implementations thereof; as such, any correct implementation is likely affected. Users are encouraged to install updates to affected products and hosts as they are available. For information about a specific vendor or product, check the Vendor Information section of this document or contact the vendor directly. Note that the vendor list below is not exhaustive. |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

10/18/2017 **Security advisory for the vulnerabilities of WPA2 protocol**

ASUS is aware of the recent WPA2 vulnerability issue. We take your security and privacy seriously and are currently working towards a full solution as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we want to help clarify the severity of the potential threat, and let our valued customers know the appropriate steps to take in order to avoid or lessen the threat of being compromised.

Your devices are only vulnerable if an attacker is in physical proximity to your wireless network and is able to gain access to it. This exploit cannot steal your banking information, passwords, or other data on a secured connection that utilizes proper end-to-end encryption. However, an attacker could capture and read this information on an unsecured connection via an exploited WiFi network. Depending on the network configuration, it is also possible for the attacker to redirect network traffic, send invalid data to devices or even inject malware into the network.

We are feverishly working with chipset suppliers to resolve this vulnerability and will release patched firmware for affected routers in the near future. Before this patched firmware is released, here are a few cautions all users should take:

(1) Avoid public Wi-Fi and Hotspots until the routers and your devices are updated. Use cellular network connections if possible.
(2) Only connect to secured services that you trust or have been verified. Web pages that use HTTPS or another secure connection will include HTTPS in the URL. If the connection is secured using TLS 1.2 your activities with that service is safe for now.
(3) Keep your operating system and antivirus software up-to-date. Microsoft recently updated Windows to fix this exploit on their latest operating systems. Google and Apple are following suit shortly.
(4) When in doubt, be safe and use your cellular network or a wired connection (Ethernet) to access the internet. This exploit only affects 802.11 traffic between a Wi-Fi router and a connected device on an exploited WiFi connection.

### [Barracuda Networks](#CHEU-AQNMXH) Affected

Notified:  August 28, 2017  Updated: October 24, 2017

**Statement Date:   October 19, 2017**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

On October 16th, 2017, a research paper with the title of "Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2" was made publicly available. This paper discusses seven vulnerabilities affecting session key negotiation in both the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocols. These vulnerabilities may allow the reinstallation of a pairwise transient key, a group key, or an integrity key on either a wireless client or a wireless access point. Additional research also led to the discovery of three additional vulnerabilities (not discussed in the original paper) affecting wireless supplicant supporting either the 802.11z (Extensions to Direct-Link Setup) standard or the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) standard. The three additional vulnerabilities could also allow the reinstallation of a pairwise key, group key, or integrity group key.

### [Espressif Systems](#CHEU-ARFFHX) Affected

Notified:  September 22, 2017  Updated: October 13, 2017

**Statement Date:   October 13, 2017**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Our products ESP8266 and ESP32 are affected by the vulnerability identified as VU#228519.

For ESP32, we have made remediation in ESP-IDF v2.1.1 on Github. ESP32 which uses ESP-IDF v2.1.1 or later than v2.1.1 will not be affected by this vulnerability.

For ESP8266, we have updated both RTOS SDK and NONOS SDK on Github on October 13, 2017. ESP8266 which uses RTOS SDK or NONOS SDK after October 13, 2017 will not be affected by this vulnerability.

We strongly recommend that users update their ESP-IDF, ESP8266 RTOS SDK and ESP8266 NONOS SDK to the latest version to avoid being affected by this vulnerability.

For ESP8089 and ESP8689, the supplicant protocol runs on the host side. So, whether they are affected by this vulnerability depends on which host is used. But we also recommend that users update their host to fix this vulnerability.

The updates of ESP-IDF, ESP8266 RTOS SDK and ESP8266 NONOS SDK can be found on the following website:
ESP-IDF: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>
ESP8266 RTOS SDK: <https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK>

### [Technicolor](#JLAD-AS9JHN) Affected

Updated:  October 19, 2017

**Statement Date:   October 18, 2017**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

By making use of a model-based approach, researchers from K.U Leuven University have identified several theoretical flaws in the Wi-Fi Protected Acess (WPA) protocol. These weaknesses constitute a new class of attack on the 4-way handshake used in all flavors of WPA/WPA2, named KRACK: Key Reinstallation AttaCK.

This academic research presents an industry-wide issue as all products implementing Wi-Fi are theoretically vulnerable.

In practice, no gateway or modem manufactured by Technicolor, implementing WiFi Access point routing function is affected by this class of attack. This is due to the fact that the vulnerable function allowing practical attack against the Access Point is not present. The end users should continue to use their Technicolor gateway or modem without changing WPA2 settings. In particular, none of these attacks is able to retrieve the WPA private passphrase. This recommendation is also valid for the legacy Thomson and Cisco branded gateways and modems.

The 802.11r standard makes use of a 4-way handshake protocol that was mathematically proven secure by the scientific community. Yet, the research publication exhibits weaknesses in some implementations of this protocol, that can affect the way the client connects to the Access point. For Access Points, the operational impact is very limited. Gateways and modems configured as Wi-Fi Access Point are not potentially concerned, except when supporting Fast BSS Transition handshake introduced with 802.11r standard. Fast BSS Transition handshake is usually not supported on residential gateways and modems, because this feature is intended to minimize roaming time between several access points in a managed network.

Technicolor works constantly to improve security of its products, alongside with the Wi-Fi Alliance. Technicolor remains committed to provide efficient support to its customers and end-users.

Our detailed security bulletins remain reserved for our customers. Customers can contact their Technicolor Customer Technical Support.

Affected

### Vendor Statement

AmpliFi line products are not affected since firmware v2.4.3. Firmware v2.4.2 is partially affected and all versions prior to that are affected.

All airMAX AC and M series products have fixes for the majority of WPA2 rekeying issues since v8.4.0 (AC series) and v6.0.7 (M series). Additional improvements will fully resolve the issue with v8.4.2/v6.1.2. Furthermore, our proprietary airMAX protocol makes simple attacks more difficult.

Notified:  September 28, 2017  Updated: October 16, 2017

**Statement Date:   October 10, 2017**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

On October 16. CERT/CC/ICASI released a public announcement about discovered vulnerabilities in WPA2 handshake protocols that affect most WiFi users and all vendors world wide.

RouterOS v6.39.3, v6.40.4, v6.41rc are not affected!
It is important to note that the vulnerability is discovered in the protocol itself, so even a correct implementation is affected.
These organizations did contact us earlier, so we have already released fixed versions that address the outlined issues. Not all of the discovered vulnerabilities directly impact RouterOS users, or even apply to RouterOS, but we did follow all recommendations and improved the key exchange process according to the guidelines we received from the organizations who discovered the issue.
We released fixed versions last week, so if you upgrade your devices routinely, no further action is required.
CWE-323
CVE-2017-13077
CVE-2017-13078
CVE-2017-13079
CVE-2017-13080
CVE-2017-13081
CVE-2017-13082
CVE-2017-13083
CVE-2017-13084
CVE-2017-13085
CVE-2017-13086
CVE-2017-13087

The following applies to RouterOS software prior to updates related to the issue.

nv2
nv2 is not affected in any way. This applies to both - nv2 AP and client. There is no nonce reset in key exchange possible and key re-installation is not possible, because nv2 key exchange does not directly follow 802.11 key exchange specification.

802.11 nonce reuse
RouterOS is not affected in any way, RouterOS generates cryptographically strong random initial nonce on boot and never reuses the same nonce during uptime.

802.11 key reinstallation
The device operating as client in key exchange is affected by this issue. This means that RouterOS in station modes and APs that establish WDS links with other APs are affected. RouterOS APs (both - standalone and CAPsMAN controlled), that do not establish WDS links with other APs, are not affected. Key reinstallation by resending key exchange frame allows attacker to reset encrypted frame packet counter. This allows attacker to replay frames that where previously sent by AP to client. Please note that RouterOS DOES NOT reset key to some known value that would allow attacker to inject/decrypt any frames to/from client.

Suggested course of action
It is always recommended to upgrade to latest RouterOS version, but depending on wireless protocol and mode the suggested course of action is as follows:
- nv2: no action necessary
- 802.11/nstreme AP without WDS: no action necessary
- CAPsMAN: no action necessary
- 802.11/nstreme client (all station modes) or AP with WDS: upgrade to fixed version ASAP.

### Vendor Information

Though Mikrotik has self-identified as not affected, they have published updates that "improved WPA2 key exchange reliability" (see <https://mikrotik.com/download/changelogs>).

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2907)

## Topic

An update for wpa\_supplicant is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The wpa\_supplicant packages contain an 802.1X Supplicant with support for WEP, WPA, WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN), and various EAP authentication methods. They implement key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator for client stations and controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication and association of the WLAN driver.

Security Fix(es):

* A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit these attacks to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by manipulating cryptographic handshakes used by the WPA2 protocol. (CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13082, CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, CVE-2017-13088)

Red Hat would like to thank CERT for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Mathy Vanhoef (University of Leuven) as the original reporter of these issues.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for wpa\_supplicant
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2017:2755-1
Rating: important
References: #1056061
Cross-References: CVE-2017-13078 CVE-2017-13079 CVE-2017-13080
CVE-2017-13081 CVE-2017-13087 CVE-2017-13088
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 42.3
openSUSE Leap 42.2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 6 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for wpa\_supplicant fixes the security issues:
- Several vulnerabilities in standard conforming implementations of the
WPA2 protocol have been discovered and published under the code name
KRACK. This update remedies those issues in a backwards compatible
manner, i.e. the updated wpa\_supplicant can interface properly with both
vulnerable and patched implementations of WPA2, but an attacker won't be
able to exploit the KRACK weaknesses in those connections anymore even
if the other party is still vulnerable. [bsc#1056061, CVE-2017-13078,
CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13081, CVE-2017-13087,
CVE-2017-13088]
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.

                 CVE-2017-13081 CVE-2017-13082 CVE-2017-13086 CVE-2017-13087
                 CVE-2017-13088

Mathy Vanhoef of the imec-DistriNet research group of KU Leuven discovered
multiple vulnerabilities in the WPA protocol, used for authentication in
wireless networks. Those vulnerabilities applies to both the access point
(implemented in hostapd) and the station (implemented in wpa_supplicant).

An attacker exploiting the vulnerabilities could force the vulnerable system to
reuse cryptographic session keys, enabling a range of cryptographic attacks
against the ciphers used in WPA1 and WPA2.

More information can be found in the researchers's paper, Key Reinstallation
Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2.

CVE-2017-13077: reinstallation of the pairwise key in the Four-way handshake
CVE-2017-13078: reinstallation of the group key in the Four-way handshake
CVE-2017-13079: reinstallation of the integrity group key in the Four-way
                handshake

CVE-2017-13082: accepting a retransmitted Fast BSS Transition Reassociation
                Request and reinstalling the pairwise key while processing it
CVE-2017-13086: reinstallation of the Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) PeerKey
                (TPK) key in the TDLS handshake
CVE-2017-13087: reinstallation of the group key (GTK) when processing a
                Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame
CVE-2017-13088: reinstallation of the integrity group key (IGTK) when
                processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode
                Response frame

Red Hat Product Security has been made aware of several vulnerabilities affecting wpa\_supplicant. Eight of these vulnerabilities ([CVE-2017-13077](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13077), [CVE-2017-13078](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13078), [CVE-2017-13079](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13079), [CVE-2017-13080](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13080), [CVE-2017-13081](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13081), [CVE-2017-13082](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13082), [CVE-2017-13087](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13087), and [CVE-2017-13088](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13088)) have been rated as [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/), while the remaining two ([CVE-2017-13084](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13084) and [CVE-2017-13086](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-13086)) have been rated as [Low](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/). These issues were publicly disclosed on Monday October 16th, 2017.

## Background Information

A new exploitation technique targeting the WPA2 protocol has been discovered. Attacks based on this new technique are called "key reinstallation attacks" (KRACKs). A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this technique to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by manipulating cryptographic handshakes used by the WPA2 protocol.

Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) is the currently-recommended method for protecting and securing access to Wi-Fi devices. It supersedes the older, insecure, WPA and WEP Wi-Fi security methods.

The wpa\_supplicant package implements support for WPA and WPA2, including implementation of the key negotiation used to authenticate against WPA authenticators (Access Points).

## Acknowledgements

Red Hat would like to thank Mathy Vanhoef (University of Leuven) and CERT for reporting this flaw.

## Impacted Products

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).

The following Red Hat product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ELS\*

\* Red Hat does not intend to provided fixed wpa\_supplicant packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as it is in the [Extended Life-cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/#Extended_Life_Cycle_Phase) support phase.  Please contact [Red Hat Global Support Services](https://access.redhat.com/) with any questions.

## Vulnerability Details

These attacks are possible due to weaknesses within the WPA2 standard itself. By manipulating the cryptographic handshake used by WPA2 (for example, the 4-way-handshake used to ensure both client and access point have the correct credentials), a remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could force a victim's device into installing a key that's already in use. This weakens the security of WPA2 to a level where it's feasible for an attacker to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or inject forged Wi-Fi packets.

Instead of reinstalling a previous real key, wpa\_supplicant could be tricked into installing a cleared, all-zero encryption key. This makes it particularly easy for an attacker to decrypt or manipulate Wi-Fi traffic. The wpa\_supplicant package as shipped via Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is affected by this issue. The wpa\_supplicant package as shipped via Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is affected by a related problem involving different 4-way handshake sequences.

An attacker must be within range of the Wi-Fi network in order to attempt the attack and while changing the Wi-Fi password will not prevent the attack, it is also not possible to recover the Wi-Fi password using the attack either.  Successfully executing this type of attack, or a future variation of it, could result in a man-in-the-middle situation allowing the attacker to capture and sniff all network traffic from an unpatched Wi-Fi client or access point.

WPA2 is still the most secure Wi-Fi security mechanism, and switching to WPA or WEP is not suggested.  Until updates can be installed, we recommend to use wired networking whenever possible.

\* Added more clarity on hostapd PTK rekeying and ANonce issue applying
regardless of whether FT is enabled
Vulnerability
A vulnerability was found in how a number of implementations can be
triggered to reconfigure WPA/WPA2/RSN keys (TK, GTK, or IGTK) by
replaying a specific frame that is used to manage the keys. Such
reinstallation of the encryption key can result in two different types
of vulnerabilities: disabling replay protection and significantly
reducing the security of encryption to the point of allowing frames to
be decrypted or some parts of the keys to be determined by an attacker
depending on which cipher is used.
This document focuses on the cases that apply to systems using hostapd
(AP) or wpa\_supplicant (station), but it should be noted that the
generic vulnerability itself is applicable to other implementations and
may have different impact in other cases.
This vulnerability can in theory apply to any case where a TK (the
pairwise/unicast encryption key used with TKIP, CCMP, GCMP), a GTK
(group/multicast encryption key), or an IGTK (group management frame
integrity protection key) is configured by the Authentication/Supplicant
component to the WLAN driver/firmware taking care of the TX/RX path and
encryption/decryption of frames.
If the same key is configured multiple times, it is likely that the
transmit and receive packet numbers (PN, IPN, RSC/TSC, etc.) are cleared
to a smaller value (zero in case of pairwise keys, zero or at least a
smaller value than the last used value in case of group keys). When this
happens with the same key, this breaks replay protection on RX side and
can result in reuse of packet numbers on TX side. The former may allow
replaying of previously delivered packets (without the attacker being
able to decrypt them or modify their contents) while the latter may
result in more severe issues on the TX side due to resulting CCM nonce
replay and related issues with GCMP and TKIP. The TX side issue may make
it significantly easier for the attacker to decrypt frames and determine
some parts of the keys (e.g., a Michael MIC key in case of TKIP).
Impact on AP/hostapd
On the AP side, this generic issue has been determined to be applicable
in the case where hostapd is used to operate an RSN/WPA2 network with FT
(Fast BSS Transition from IEEE 802.11r) enabled. Replaying of the
Reassociation Request frame can be used to get the AP reinstalling the
TK which results in the AP accepting previously delivered unicast frames
from the station and the AP reusing previously used packet numbers
(local TX packet number gets reset to zero). This latter issue on the TX
side can result in CCM nonce reuse which invalidates CCMP security
properties. In case of TKIP this can result in the attacker being able
to determine part of the TK more easily and with GCMP, result in similar
issues.
It should be noted that the AP side issue with FT would be close to
applying to FILS authentication (from IEEE 802.11ai) in hostapd with
replaying of (Re)Association Request frames. However, due to a different
handling of the repeated association processing with FILS, this would
actually result in the station getting immediately disconnected which
prevents this attack in practice. In addition, the FILS implementation
in the current hostapd version is still experimental and documented as
being discouraged in production use cases.
Another area of potentially reduced security was identified when looking
into these issues. When AP/Authenticator implementation in hostapd is
requested to rekey the PTK without performing EAP reauthentication
(either through local periodic rekeying or due to a request from an
association station), the ANonce value does not get updated. This
results in the new 4-way handshake depending on the station/supplicant
side generating a new, unique (for the current PMK/PSK) SNonce for the
PTK derivation to result in a new key. While a properly working
supplicant would do so, if there is a supplicant implementation that
does not, this combination could result in deriving the same PTK
again. When the TK from that PTK gets configured in the driver, this
would result in reinstalling the same key and the same issues as
described above for the FT protocol case. It should be noted that this
PTK rekeying issue is independent of FT and is applicable for all cases
where hostapd is used with WPA/RSN.
Impact on station/wpa\_supplicant
On the station side, this generic issue has been determined to be
applicable in the cases where wpa\_supplicant processes a group key (GTK
or IGTK) update from the AP. An attacker that is able to limit access
to frame delivery may be able to extract two update messages and deliver
those to the station with significant time delay between them. When
wpa\_supplicant processes the second message, it may end up reinstalling
the same key to the driver and when doing this, clear the RX packet
number to an old value. This would allow the attacker to replay all
group-addressed frames that the AP sent between the time the key update
message was originally sent and the time when the attacker forwarded the
second frame to the station. The attacker would not be able to decrypt
or modify the frames based on this vulnerability, though. There is an
exception to this with older wpa\_supplicant versions as noted below in
version specific notes.
For the current wpa\_supplicant version (v2.6), there is also an
additional EAPOL-Key replay sequence where an additional forged
EAPOL-Key message can be used to bypass the existing protection for the
pairwise key reconfiguration in a manner that ends up configuring a
known TK that an attacker could use to decrypt any frame sent by the
station and to inject arbitrary unicast frames. Similar issues are
reachable in older versions as noted below.
PeerKey / TDLS PeerKey
As far as the related CVE-2017-13084 (reinstallation of the STK key in
the PeerKey handshake) is concerned, it should be noted that PeerKey
implementation in wpa\_supplicant is not fully functional and the actual
installation of the key into the driver does not work. As such, this
item is not applicable in practice. Furthermore, the PeerKey handshake
for IEEE 802.11e DLS is obsolete and not known to have been deployed.
As far as the TDLS PeerKey handshake is concerned (CVE-2017-13086),
wpa\_supplicant implementation is already rejecting TPK M2 retries, so
the reconfiguration issue cannot apply for it. For TPK M3, there is a
theoretical impact. However, if that frame is replayed, the current
wpa\_supplicant implementation ends up tearing down the TDLS link
immediately and as such, there is no real window for performing the
attack. Furthermore, TPK M3 goes through the AP path and if RSN is used
there, that frame has replay protection, so the attacker could not
perform the attack. If the AP path were to use WEP, the frame could be
replayed, though. That said, if WEP is used on the AP path, it would be
fair to assume that there is no security in the network, so a new attack
vector would be of small additional value.
With older wpa\_supplicant versions, it may be possible for an attacker
to cause TPK M2 to be retransmitted with delay that would be able to
trigger reinstallation of TK on the peer receiving TPK M2
(CVE-2017-13086). This may open a short window for the attack with v2.3,
v2.4, and v2.5; and a longer window with older versions.
Vulnerable versions/configurations
For the AP/Authenticator TK (unicast) reinstallation in FT protocol
(CVE-2017-13082):
hostapd v0.7.2 and newer with FT enabled (i.e., practically all versions
that include full FT implementation). FT needs to be enabled in the
runtime configuration to make this applicable.
For the AP/Authenticator missing ANonce during PTK rekeying:
All hostapd versions (regardless of whether FT is enabled).
For the station/Supplicant side GTK/IGTK reinstallation and TK
configuration:
All wpa\_supplicant versions. The impact on older versions can be more
severe due to earlier changes in this area: v2.3 and older can also
reinstall the pairwise key and as such have similar impact as the AP FT
case (CVE-2017-13077); v2.4 and v2.5 end up configuring an all-zero TK
which breaks the normal data path, but could allow an attacker to
decrypt all following frames from the station and to inject arbitrary
frames to the station. In addition, a different message sequence
involving 4-way handshake can result in configuration of an all-zero TK
in v2.6 and the current snapshot of the development repository as of the
publication of this advisory.

Possible mitigation steps
- For AP/hostapd and FT replay issue (CVE-2017-13082), it is possible to
prevent the issue temporarily by disabling FT in runtime
configuration, if needed before being able to update the
implementations.
- Merge the following commits to hostapd/wpa\_supplicant and rebuild them:
hostapd and replayed FT reassociation request frame (CVE-2017-13082):
hostapd: Avoid key reinstallation in FT handshake
hostapd PTK rekeying and ANonce update:
Fix PTK rekeying to generate a new ANonce
wpa\_supplicant and GTK/IGTK rekeying (CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079,
CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13081, CVE-2017-13087, CVE-2017-13088):
Prevent reinstallation of an already in-use group key
Extend protection of GTK/IGTK reinstallation of WNM-Sleep Mode cases
wpa\_supplicant (v2.6 or newer snapshot) and known TK issue:
Prevent installation of an all-zero TK
Additional protection steps for wpa\_supplicant:
TDLS: Reject TPK-TK reconfiguration
WNM: Ignore WNM-Sleep Mode Response without pending request
FT: Do not allow multiple Reassociation Response frames
These patches are available from https://w1.fi/security/2017-1/
(both against the snapshot of hostap.git master branch and rebased on
top of the v2.6 release)
For the TDLS TPK M2 retransmission issue (CVE-2017-13086) with older
wpa\_supplicant versions, consider updating to the latest version or
merge in a commit that is present in v2.6:
https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=dabdef9e048b17b22b1c025ad592922eab30dda8
('TDLS: Ignore incoming TDLS Setup Response retries')
- Update to hostapd/wpa\_supplicant v2.7 or newer, once available
\* it should be noted that there are number of additional changes in
the related areas of the implementation to provide extra layer of
protection for potential unknown issues; these changes are not
included in this advisory as they have not been identified to be
critical for preventing any of the identified security
vulnerabilities; however, users of hostapd/wpa\_supplicant are
encouraged to consider merging such changes even if not fully
moving to v2.7

SUSE Security Update: Security update for wpa\_supplicant
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2017:2752-1
Rating: important
References: #1056061
Cross-References: CVE-2017-13078 CVE-2017-13079 CVE-2017-13080
CVE-2017-13081 CVE-2017-13087 CVE-2017-13088

An update that fixes 6 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for wpa\_supplicant fixes the following issues:
- Several vulnerabilities in standard conforming implementations of the
WPA2 protocol have been discovered and published under the code name
KRACK. This update remedies those issues in a backwards compatible
manner, i.e. the updated wpa\_supplicant can interface properly with both
vulnerable and patched implementations of WPA2, but an attacker won't be
able to exploit the KRACK weaknesses in those connections anymore even
if the other party is still vulnerable. [bsc#1056061, CVE-2017-13078,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1500303#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-10-10 11:19:36 UTC  ``` Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) handshake traffic can be manipulated to induce nonce and session key reuse, resulting in key reinstallation by a victim wireless access point (AP) or client. After establishing a man-in-the-middle position between an AP and client, an attacker can selectively manipulate the timing and transmission of messages in the WPA2 Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode handshake, resulting in out-of-sequence reception or retransmission of messages.  An attacker within the wireless communications range of an affected AP and client may leverage these vulnerabilities to conduct attacks that are dependent on the data confidentiality protocol being used. Attacks may include arbitrary packet decryption and injection, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, or the replay of unicast, broadcast, and multicast frames.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1500303#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-10-10 11:19:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: CERT Upstream: Mathy Vanhoef (University of Leuven)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1500303#c7)  Andrej Nemec    2017-10-16 09:43:31 UTC  ``` Created hostapd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1502588](show_bug.cgi?id=1502588 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-13077 CVE-2017-13078 CVE-2017-13079 CVE-2017-13080 CVE-2017-13081 CVE-2017-13082 CVE-2017-13086 CVE-2017-13087 CVE-2017-13088 hostapd: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   Created wpa_supplicant tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1502589](show_bug.cgi?id=1502589 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-13077 CVE-2017-13078 CVE-2017-13079 CVE-2017-13080 CVE-2017-13081 CVE-2017-13082 CVE-2017-13086 CVE-2017-13087 CVE-2017-13088 wpa_supplicant: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1500303#c9)  Stefan Cornelius    2017-10-17 09:43:24 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/kracks> <https://w1.fi/security/2017-1/wpa-packet-number-reuse-with-replayed-messages.txt> <https://www.krackattacks.com/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1500303#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-17 21:40:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:2907 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2907](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2907)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1500303#c11)  Stefan Cornelius    2017-10-18 08:50:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issues affects the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

# Android Security Bulletin—November 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published November 6, 2017 | Updated November 8, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2017-11-06 or later address
all of these issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check and update
your Android version](//support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705).

Android partners were notified of all issues in the 2017-11-01 and 2017-11-05
patch levels at least a month before publication. Android partners were notified
of all issues in the 2017-11-06 patch level within the last month. Source code
patches for these issues have been released to the Android Open Source Project
(AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin also includes
links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in Media
framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to
execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google Play
Protect mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and Google Play Protect, which improve the
security of the Android platform.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air update (OTA) and
firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[November 2017
Pixel / Nexus Security Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2017-11-01).

## Announcements

* We have launched a new
  [Pixel / Nexus Security
  Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel), which contains information on additional security
  vulnerabilities and functional improvements that are addressed on supported
  Pixel and Nexus devices. Android device manufacturers may choose to address
  these issues on their devices. See [Common questions and
  answers](#questions) for additional information.
* Security patches for the KRACK vulnerabilities are provided under the
  2017-11-06 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [Google Play Protect](//www.android.com/play-protect). These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through [Google Play Protect](//www.android.com/play-protect) and warns
  users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile Services](//www.android.com/gms), and is
  especially important for users who install apps from outside of Google
  Play.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see [Check
& update your Android version](//support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-11-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-11-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-11-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-11-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.
* Security patch levels of 2017-11-06 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-11-06 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-11-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-11-05]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-11-06]

**2. Why does this bulletin have three security patch levels?**

This bulletin has three security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2017-11-01 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues
  reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the 2017-11-05 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, the 2017-11-01 security patch level,
  as well as fixes for all issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2017-11-06 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer
site](//developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device/partner security bulletins, such as the Pixel / Nexus bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android devices.
Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in the device/partner
security bulletins are not required for declaring a security patch level.
Android device and chipset manufacturers are encouraged to document the presence
of other fixes on their devices through their own security websites, such as the
[Samsung](//security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb), [LGE](//lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates.html), or [Pixel / Nexus](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel) security bulletins.

# hostapd and wpa\_supplicant: Key Reinstallation (KRACK) attacks — GLSA **201711-03**

A flaw was discovered in the 4-way handshake in hostapd and
wpa\_supplicant that allows attackers to conduct a Man in the Middle attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-wireless/hostapd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6-r1** |

| Package | **net-wireless/wpa\_supplicant** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6-r3** |

### Background

wpa\_supplicant is a WPA Supplicant with support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE
802.11i / RSN). hostapd is a user space daemon for access point and
authentication servers.

### Description

WiFi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) and it’s associated technologies
are all vulnerable to the KRACK attacks. Please review the referenced CVE
identifiers for details.

### Impact

An attacker can carry out the KRACK attacks on a wireless network in
order to gain access to network clients. Once achieved, the attacker can
potentially harvest confidential information (e.g. HTTP/HTTPS), inject
malware, or perform a myriad of other attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All hostapd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/hostapd-2.6-r1"

```

All wpa\_supplicant users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=net-wireless/wpa_supplicant-2.6-r3"

```

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 4.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 4.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 4.3 |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

SSA-901333: KRACK Attacks Vulnerabilities in Industrial Products

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 6.8

2017-11-09
2019-04-09
V1.6

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities affecting WPA/WPA2 implementations were identiﬁed by a researcher and publicly
disclosed under the term "Key Reinstallation Attacks" (KRACK). These vulnerabilities could potentially
allow an attacker within the radio range of the wireless network to decrypt, replay or inject forged network
packets into the wireless communication.

Several Siemens Industrial products use WPA/WPA2 and are therefore affected by some of the vulnerabil-
ities.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• The attacker must be within radio range of the affected devices. The attacker must trigger the start
of a new WLAN handshake in order to perform the attack. If WPA2- CCMP (AES) is conﬁgured on
the devices, then attacks are limited to decryption and replay of parts of the network trafﬁc. The
attacker cannot join the Wireless network, or obtain the WPA2 key.

• SCALANCE WLC711 and WLC712 are only affected by the vulnerabilities related to the group key
in the default conﬁguration. An attacker is therefore not able to access unicast trafﬁc. The devices
are only affected by CVE-2017-13082 if they have 802.11r functionality activated. IEEE 802.11r is
deactivated by default. The devices are only affected by the remaining vulnerabilities if the functions
“MeshConnex” or “Client Bridge Mode” are active. Both functions are disabled by default. If these
modes have been activated and are not required for the operation of a wireless environment, then
customers can deactivate the functionality to reduce the risk.

• SCALANCE W-700 devices that are operated in Client mode, SIMATIC Mobile Panel 277F IWLAN,
and SIMATIC ET200 WLAN are not affected if the iPCF, iPCF-MC, or iPCF-HT features are enabled.

• SCALANCE W-700 devices operated in Access Point mode are only affected if WDS with WPA2
encryption is conﬁgured. If iPCF, iPCF-MC, or iPCF-HT is active on all interfaces, then SCALANCE
W-700 devices are not vulnerable.

• RUGGEDCOM RX1400 and RS9xxW are not vulnerable if operated in Access Point mode.

• SCALANCE W1750D devices are not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities in the default conﬁgura-
tion. Only customers that enabled the “Mesh” or “WiFi uplink” functionality are affected by the
vulnerabilities. Disabling these functionalities will completely mitigate the vulnerabilities.

• Ensure multiple layers of security, do not depend on the security of WPA2 alone.

• Use WPA2-CCMP (AES) instead of WPA2-TKIP or WPA-GCMP, if supported by the WLAN clients

to reduce the risk of potential attacks

• Apply Defense-in-Depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

## Details

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that wpa\_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly

handled WPA2. A remote attacker could use this issue with key

reinstallation attacks to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-13077](/security/CVE-2017-13077),

[CVE-2017-13078](/security/CVE-2017-13078), [CVE-2017-13079](/security/CVE-2017-13079), [CVE-2017-13080](/security/CVE-2017-13080), [CVE-2017-13081](/security/CVE-2017-13081),

[CVE-2017-13082](/security/CVE-2017-13082), [CVE-2017-13086](/security/CVE-2017-13086), [CVE-2017-13087](/security/CVE-2017-13087), [CVE-2017-13088](/security/CVE-2017-13088))

Imre Rad discovered that wpa\_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled

invalid characters in passphrase parameters. A remote attacker could use

this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4476](/security/CVE-2016-4476))

Imre Rad discovered that wpa\_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly handled

invalid characters in passphrase parameters. A local attacker could use

this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-4477](/security/CVE-2016-4477))
