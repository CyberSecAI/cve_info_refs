Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-13809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A validation issue exists in the AppleScript component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability is a validation issue related to how AppleScript is decompiled using `osadecompile`. This weakness allows for arbitrary code execution during the decompilation process. The document states "A validation issue was addressed with improved input sanitization."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Decompiling a specially crafted AppleScript using `osadecompile` can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the use of a maliciously crafted AppleScript file that is then decompiled using `osadecompile`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide a maliciously crafted AppleScript file to the target machine and execute the `osadecompile` tool on it.
