Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-13798:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) condition in WebKit's `WebCore::RenderObject::previousSibling` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The vulnerability occurs when a `RenderObject` is freed, but a reference to it is still held and later accessed. This leads to memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by enticing them to visit a malicious webpage.
-  **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can be triggered to cause a denial of service, by crashing the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting malicious web content and enticing the victim to visit the crafted page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious HTML page or inject malicious code into a website visited by the victim.
- No special privileges are required.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Technical Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the column-span style is set to all on a summary tag inside a details tag that is inside a pre tag.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the JavaScript code that uses `document.execCommand` with the "indent" argument, combined with `window.getSelection().setBaseAndExtent` method, along with a recursive call to the function that contains these commands.
- The vulnerability occurs when `WebCore::RenderObject::previousSibling` is called after the object has been freed.

**Affected software:**
- WebKitGTK+ versions prior to 2.18.3
- Safari 11.0.1
- tvOS 11.1
- iTunes 12.7.1 for Windows
- iCloud for Windows 7.1
- iOS 11.1

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Ivan Fratric of Google Project Zero, and was also found in WebKit by Google Security Research.
- The exploit from Exploit-DB includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) HTML code that triggers the vulnerability and also includes an ASan log.
- The vulnerability is addressed in multiple Apple products and WebKitGTK+ by updating the WebKit engine.
