{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing runtime check when processing TIFF images. Specifically, the `TIFFWriteDirectorySec` function in `tif_dirwrite.c` contains an assertion (`assert(na<ndir)`) that triggers if the SubIFD tag is not found, leading to an abort.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing runtime check",
      "Assertion failure leading to abort"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted TIFF image can trigger an assertion failure in `TIFFWriteDirectorySec()`, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application that processes the image.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted TIFF image"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TIFF image to the vulnerable application or service."
