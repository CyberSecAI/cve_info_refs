Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-13037:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The root cause is a buffer over-read in the `ip_printts()` function within the `print-ip.c` file of `tcpdump`. This function is responsible for parsing and printing timestamp options in IP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Buffer Over-read:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking while processing IP timestamp options. Specifically, the code does not properly validate the length and pointer values before accessing memory, which can lead to reading data outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is a buffer over-read, which could result in the disclosure of process memory. An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from memory if this vulnerability is triggered.
*   **Denial of Service (Potential):** Some of the provided text refers to other issues in `tcpdump`, and that a remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a denial of service. While not directly related to CVE-2017-13037, this is mentioned in the general vulnerability discussion for tcpdump and is a risk for the tcpdump application in general

**Attack Vectors**

*   **Network Traffic:** The attack vector is primarily network-based. A malicious actor can craft a specific IP packet with malformed timestamp options. When `tcpdump` processes this packet, the vulnerable code path is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running the vulnerable version of `tcpdump`. This means that an attacker would be positioned on the same network or can send traffic to it through routing.
*   **Malicious Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting malicious IP packets with specific, malformed timestamp options to trigger the buffer over-read.
*   **No Special Privileges:** This vulnerability can potentially be exploited remotely without special privileges on the target system.

**Additional Details**

*   **Patch:** The vulnerability was addressed in `tcpdump` version 4.9.2. Patches include additional boundary checks before processing IP timestamp options in `ip_printts()` in the `print-ip.c` file.
*   **Test Case:** The fix included a test case (with the supplied modified PCAP file) that is now part of the testing suite, that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Systems:** The vulnerability affects various systems and Linux distributions that include the vulnerable version of tcpdump.

In summary, CVE-2017-13037 is a buffer over-read vulnerability in `tcpdump`'s IP timestamp option processing that allows a remote attacker to read process memory by sending a specially crafted IP packet to the vulnerable system. The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.9.2 of tcpdump, and RedHat provides patches in RHEA-2018:0705.
