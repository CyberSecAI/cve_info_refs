  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2017-13084": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to ambiguities in the processing of associated protocol messages during the PeerKey handshake. By establishing a man-in-the-middle position between the stations and retransmitting previously used messages exchanges between stations, an attacker can force an STSL to reinstall a previously used STK.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Reinstallation of the Station-To-Station Link(STSL) Transient Key (STK) during the PeerKey handshake."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker within radio range can replay, decrypt, or spoof frames.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Remote attacker within Wi-Fi range",
          "Man-in-the-middle attack by replaying messages"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "Must be within range of the Wi-Fi network to attempt the attack"
      }
