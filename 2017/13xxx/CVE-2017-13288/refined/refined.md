  "CVE-2017-13288": {
    "Description": "The provided content is related to a fix for a bug in VerifyCredentialResponse serialization. It does not describe the vulnerability itself but the fix for the vulnerability. The relevant part extracted from the Android Security Bulletinâ€”April 2018.",
    "Root cause": "There was an asymmetry between the parceling and unparceling of VerifyCredentialResponse, which could lead to type confusion if packed with other objects in a Parcel.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion due to asymmetric parceling/unparceling."
    ],
    "Impact": "A type confusion could occur if VerifyCredentialResponse is packed with other objects in a Parcel, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exploitable conditions.",
     "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector isn't detailed in the provided content. It would likely involve crafting a malicious parcel with a manipulated VerifyCredentialResponse object.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The required attacker capabilities and position are not explicitly stated, but it is implied that an attacker would need to be able to manipulate or create a crafted parcel that includes the vulnerable object. Given the context, this vulnerability could be exploited by a local application or a process with access to the parcel. Further context would be needed to specify the exact exploitation method."
