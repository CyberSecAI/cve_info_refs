```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the ARP packet parsing logic within the `print-arp.c` file of tcpdump.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds Read"
  ],
  "Impact": "A specially crafted ARP packet could trigger the vulnerability, leading to a crash due to the over-read. It is also possible that this vulnerability could be exploited to achieve remote code execution. The specific impact depends on the way the program is compiled and the system where it is running.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers can send a malicious ARP packet to a vulnerable system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject network traffic into the affected network. No special position or capabilities are required.",
  "Additional details": "The fix involves adding bounds checking to ensure that the program does not read beyond the allocated buffers when parsing ARP packets. The vulnerability occurs when the protocol type isn't ETHERTYPE_IP or ETHERTYPE_TRAIL, or when the protocol address length isn't 4."
