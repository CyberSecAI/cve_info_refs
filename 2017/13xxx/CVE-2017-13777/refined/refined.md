Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-13777:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ReadXBMImage()` function within the `coders/xbm.c` file of GraphicsMagick. Specifically, the loop at line 314 (in version 1.3.26) lacks an end-of-file (EOF) check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unbounded loop:** The `for` loop iterates based on `bytes_per_line * image->rows` without verifying if there's enough data left to read from the input file.
- **Integer Overflow Potential:** Although not directly stated as the root cause, the vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the dimensions (`image->rows` and `image->columns`) to cause an excessive amount of reads. The `bytes_per_line` is calculated based on columns.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A specially crafted XBM image with large `image->rows` and `image->columns` values, but insufficient backing data, can cause the program to enter an infinite loop consuming excessive CPU and memory resources.
-  The process can last a long time (more than 9 minutes reported) and consume significant system resources.
- **Resource exhaustion:** The provided example caused 100% CPU utilization and up to 4GB of RAM consumption, leading to system unresponsiveness.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious image file:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted XBM image file.
- **File Processing:** The attack is triggered when the `gm convert` command (or similar functionality that uses the vulnerable library) processes the malicious XBM file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted XBM file to an application using the vulnerable version of GraphicsMagick. This could be through various methods like uploading a file, processing a file from a website, or any other means where GraphicsMagick processes untrusted image files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Xiaohei and Wangchu from Alibaba Security Team.
- The fix involves adding checks to prevent reading past the end of the input data.
- The vulnerability affects GraphicsMagick version 1.3.26.
- A patch was released on 2017-08-26.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2017-13777 on 2017-08-30.
- The fix commit is `233a720bfd5e`
