Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an infinite recursion within the `dos_load_ext_table()` function in the `tsk/vs/dos.c` file of The Sleuth Kit (TSK) library. This function is responsible for loading DOS extended partition tables. A crafted disk image can trigger this recursion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper checks or logic to prevent infinite recursion when parsing extended partition tables in DOS disk images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite recursion leads to a hang (program freeze) of the `mmls` tool, which uses the vulnerable library, effectively preventing it from processing the malicious disk image. This is demonstrated when running `mmls -t dos hang.img`.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: While not explicitly stated, infinite recursion typically results in stack exhaustion, ultimately leading to a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Disk Image:** The attack vector is a specially crafted disk image that exploits the flawed logic in `dos_load_ext_table()`.
- **Command-Line Tool:** The `mmls` command-line tool is the specific vector used to trigger the vulnerability, though any tool that uses this library and attempts to process a crafted DOS disk image could be affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted disk image to the vulnerable software (e.g. through file system access or as a parameter to command-line tool).
- **No Special Privileges:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without any special privileges, as demonstrated in the `mmls` command in the provided test case.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and input files from files.fuzzing-project.org, implying that it might have been found by automated vulnerability discovery tools.
- The provided backtrace shows the call stack leading to the infinite recursion within `dos_load_ext_table()`, clearly indicating the root cause.
- The provided code snippet to reproduce the issue, along with the backtrace information and the description of the bug, provides a very good amount of technical detail for the vulnerability.
- A fix was released in version 4.4.0-5+deb9u1 of sleuthkit package for Debian 9 (stretch) which addresses this vulnerability along with CVE-2017-13755, CVE-2017-13760, CVE-2018-19497, CVE-2020-10232 and CVE-2019-1010065
