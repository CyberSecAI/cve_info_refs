We believe that a server impersonation\nor man in the middle attack is possible, but it is more challenging.\n\nROBOT only affects TLS cipher modes that use RSA encryption. Most modern\nTLS connections use an Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman key exchange and\nneed RSA only for signatures.\n\nThis attack does not recover the server's private key. It does only allow an attacker to decrypt ciphertexts or sign messages with the server's private key.\n\nWe changed it to allow various different signals to distinguish between\nerror types like timeouts, connection resets, duplicate TLS alerts.",
