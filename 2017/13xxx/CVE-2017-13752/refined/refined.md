{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a reachable assertion failure in the `jpc_dequantize` function, where the `absstepsize` parameter can have a negative value leading to an assertion failure, resulting in a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code does not properly validate the input `absstepsize` parameter, allowing a negative value that triggers the assertion.",
      "The `jpc_dequantize` function uses an assertion instead of proper error handling, leading to a crash instead of graceful failure."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote denial-of-service attack can be achieved by providing a crafted input that triggers the assertion failure, causing the application to abort.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can provide a specially crafted image file that, when processed by the vulnerable JasPer library, triggers the negative `absstepsize` condition in `jpc_dequantize`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image file to the vulnerable application, which could be achieved by opening or processing a malicious file. No specific privileges are needed.",
    "details": "The `jpc_dequantize` function in `jpc_dec.c` does not properly validate the `absstepsize` parameter, which can be a negative number under certain conditions. When `absstepsize` is negative, the assertion `absstepsize >= 0` fails, causing the program to abort and resulting in a denial-of-service."
