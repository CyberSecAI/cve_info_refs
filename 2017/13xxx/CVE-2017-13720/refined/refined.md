Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-13720:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the `PatternMatch` function within the `libXfont` library. This function is responsible for matching font names against a provided pattern. The issue arises when the pattern contains the `?` character, which is used as a wildcard to match any single character in a string. The function increments the string pointer even when it encounters a null byte (`\0`) character, leading to a read beyond the intended string boundary.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insufficient input validation:** The `PatternMatch` function doesn't check for the end of the string when processing `?` wildcard characters.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** By not properly checking for the null terminator, the code attempts to read beyond the allocated memory for the string.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crash of the X server or the application using the library is a potential consequence, leading to a denial of service.
*  **Memory Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read might expose sensitive information stored in the memory near the string being processed.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerable code is triggered when a font is loaded with a specially crafted font pattern with multiple "?" characters. This can happen through an X client or server-side during font handling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the font pattern being processed by the vulnerable `libXfont` library, for example, by sending an X client request to open a font with such pattern.

**Additional notes from the content:**
*   The vulnerability was identified by Michal Srb (SUSE) and the fix was reviewed by Peter Hutterer.
*   The fix involves adding a check to make sure that the string pointer does not read past the end of the string when handling `?` characters
*   The issue affects libXfont and libXfont2. Patches were created for both libraries.
*   The provided content contains information from various distributions/vendors like Debian, Red Hat, and SUSE.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have low priority/severity by some vendors.
