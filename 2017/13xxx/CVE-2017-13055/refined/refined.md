Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13055:

**1. Verification:**

The content from multiple sources, including Gentoo, tcpdump.org, Apple, Red Hat, Debian and GitHub, all confirms that CVE-2017-13055 is related to a vulnerability in the `tcpdump` utility. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the IS-IS protocol parsing code.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the `isis_print_is_reach_subtlv()` function in `print-isoclns.c`. The code was missing a check to ensure that a sub-TLV, referred to as "V", was actually present in the input buffer, before attempting to access it.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Over-read:** The missing length check allows the code to potentially read beyond the boundaries of the allocated buffer when processing an Extended IS Reachability sub-TLV.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By sending a crafted IS-IS packet with a malformed Extended IS Reachability sub-TLV, a remote attacker could trigger a buffer over-read causing the `tcpdump` process to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the possibility of arbitrary code execution is mentioned in multiple sources, this is a common impact from a buffer overflow/over-read vulnerability when the application is run with elevated privileges.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Traffic:** The attack vector is through network traffic, where a malformed IS-IS packet is crafted by an attacker and injected into the network where a vulnerable tcpdump instance is capturing traffic.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any special privileges on the machine running tcpdump.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send packets to a network that a vulnerable `tcpdump` instance is capturing, or be able to supply the vulnerable tcpdump instance with a malformed packet capture.
- **IS-IS knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the IS-IS protocol to craft a malicious packet with a specific Extended IS Reachability sub-TLV.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** `tcpdump` versions prior to 4.9.2 are affected.
- **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in `tcpdump` version 4.9.2 and later versions.
- **Red Hat's Explanation** Red Hat's advisory also mentions the affected products and the fix for the vulnerability. They provide the affected packages.
- **Gentoo's Explanation:** Gentoo's advisory also states that an attacker could "execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process".
- **Apple's Explanation:** Apple's advisory lists this CVE as one of the issues fixed by updating `tcpdump` to version 4.9.2.
- **Debian's Explanation:** Debian's advisory highlights the possibility of DoS and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **GitHub Advisory:** The GitHub advisory confirms the root cause of the vulnerability and lists a commit that fixes it along with references to other security advisories.

The tcpdump changelog from tcpdump.org shows the commit that addresses this issue:
```
 CVE-2017-13055 (ISO IS-IS)
```
and the fix that was implemented by the commit:
```
In isis_print_is_reach_subtlv() one of the case blocks did not check that
the sub-TLV "V" is actually present and could over-read the input buffer.
Add a length check to fix that and remove a useless boundary check from
a loop because the boundary is tested for the full length of "V" before
the switch block.
```
This is more specific than the CVE description.
