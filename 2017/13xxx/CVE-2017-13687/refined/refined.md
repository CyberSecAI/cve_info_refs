Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13687:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2017-13687 and provides details related to the fix, indicating that the content is relevant to the CVE. Specifically, the github commit log and the Red Hat advisory directly reference this CVE, along with the affected tcpdump component.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

-   The root cause is a buffer over-read in the `chdlc_print()` function within the `print-chdlc.c` file of the tcpdump utility. The Cisco HDLC parser, responsible for parsing and processing Cisco HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) frames, contains a flaw where it can read beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

-   **Buffer Over-read:** The primary weakness is a buffer over-read vulnerability within the Cisco HDLC parser in tcpdump.  The `chdlc_print()` function lacks proper bounds checking, which leads to reading data from memory locations beyond the allocated buffer when handling specific malformed or crafted packets.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition. A specially crafted network packet could cause tcpdump to crash, making it unavailable for network traffic analysis.
-   **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly confirmed in the provided materials, the potential for arbitrary code execution may exist. Exploiting the over-read might be possible to leak or overwrite parts of memory and gain control of the tcpdump process. Red Hat's advisory states the vulnerability *might* result in "execution of arbitrary code". Gentoo also mentions "A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code".

**5. Attack Vectors**

-   **Network-based attack:** The primary attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a specially crafted Cisco HDLC packet over the network to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump.
-   The attack does not require any user interaction or special privileges to be successful.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

-   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have the ability to send network packets to a machine running a vulnerable version of tcpdump. This could be within the same network or remotely, depending on the exposure of the vulnerable service.
-   **No Special Privileges:** The attack does not require any prior privileges or user interaction on the vulnerable system.
-   **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific Cisco HDLC packet that triggers the buffer over-read.

**Summary of Key Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Buffer over-read in Cisco HDLC parser of tcpdump.
*   **Location:** `print-chdlc.c:chdlc_print()`
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential arbitrary code execution
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based, crafted Cisco HDLC packets.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Network access, ability to craft packets, no user interaction or privileges required.
*   **Affected versions:** tcpdump versions before 4.9.2.
