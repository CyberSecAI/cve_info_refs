Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13747:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `jpc_floorlog2()` function within the JasPer library. This function has an assertion `x > 0`, which can fail if the input 'x' is not a positive integer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Assertion failure:** The primary vulnerability is a reachable assertion failure in the `jpc_floorlog2()` function. When this assertion fails, the program aborts. This is due to incorrect input values that are not being validated correctly.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition. By providing a specially crafted input to JasPer, an attacker can force the `jpc_floorlog2()` function to be called with an invalid value. This will trigger the assertion and cause the program to terminate abruptly.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malformed JPEG-2000 image:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a malformed JPEG-2000 image. The crafted input could be embedded within the image data itself.
- **Specific code path:** The crash is triggered when processing the start of data marker within the image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed JPEG-2000 image to an application using the vulnerable JasPer library. This could happen in several ways such as:
    - Uploading a malicious image to a web service that processes images
    - Providing a malformed image to a user for local processing
    - Attacking a server application that parses or decodes JPEG-2000 images.

**Additional Information:**

- This CVE is related to a larger set of vulnerabilities in JasPer that were fixed in version 2.0.24, as indicated by the Fedora update notifications.
- Gentoo advises users to unmerge the jasper package due to multiple vulnerabilities and lack of upstream maintenance.
- This vulnerability has been marked as a duplicate in Red Hat Bugzilla, referencing CVE-2016-9398, indicating a similar root cause in the same function.

The provided information highlights that a malformed JPEG-2000 image file could cause a denial-of-service via an assertion failure in the `jpc_floorlog2` function within the Jasper library.
