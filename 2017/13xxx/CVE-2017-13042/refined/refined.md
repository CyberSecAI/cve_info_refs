{
  "CVE-2017-13042": {
    "Description": "The HNCP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-hncp.c:dhcpv6_print().",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `dhcpv6_print` function in `print-hncp.c` lacks bounds checking for DHCPv6 options within the HNCP DHCPv6-Data TLV.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer over-read vulnerability.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read when decoding an invalid packet. This could potentially lead to a denial of service or, possibly, arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious network packet with a malformed HNCP DHCPv6-Data TLV.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to inject or send network traffic that will be processed by a vulnerable version of tcpdump."
