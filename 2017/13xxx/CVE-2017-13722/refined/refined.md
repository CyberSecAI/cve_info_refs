Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-13722:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided documents, especially the Gentoo Security Advisory, Red Hat Bugzilla entry and Debian Security Advisory, explicitly mention CVE-2017-13722 as being related to vulnerabilities in `libXfont` and `libXfont2` stemming from a missing boundary check in the `pcfread.c` file.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause is **insufficient input validation** in the `pcfread.c` file of the `libXfont` library. Specifically, the `pcfGetProperties` function does not properly validate the offsets to strings within a PCF font file.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   -   **Missing Boundary Check:** The code lacks proper checks to ensure that the offsets (specifically `props[i].name` and `props[i].value`) used to access strings within the PCF file's string table are within the bounds of that table.
   -   **Malformed PCF Files:** This allows maliciously crafted or malformed PCF font files to provide invalid offsets.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   -   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker could provide a malformed PCF file to cause a crash in `libXfont`.
   -   **Memory Disclosure:** The lack of boundary checks can lead to reading data from memory locations beyond the bounds of allocated buffers, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**5. Attack Vectors**
    -   **Local Attack:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted PCF file.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   -   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed PCF file to a process using the vulnerable `libXfont` library.

**7. Technical Details and Descriptions**
  - The vulnerability lies in the `pcfGetProperties` function within `src/bitmap/pcfread.c`.
  - The fix, as described in the commit log from `cgit.freedesktop.org`, involves adding boundary checks to verify that `props[i].name` and `props[i].value` are within the bounds of the `strings` buffer before using them to make atoms.
    - Specifically the fix adds these checks:
```c
if (props[i].name >= string_size) {
  pcfError("pcfGetProperties(): String starts out of bounds (%ld/%d)\n", props[i].name, string_size);
  goto Bail;
}
if (props[i].value >= string_size) {
   pcfError("pcfGetProperties(): String starts out of bounds (%ld/%d)\n", props[i].value, string_size);
   goto Bail;
}
```
  - The fix also uses `strnlen` instead of `strlen` to ensure a boundary check while finding the length of the string.

**8. Additional Notes**
  - This issue affects both `libXfont` and `libXfont2`.
  - Patches and updates have been released by multiple Linux distributions, including Gentoo, Debian, SUSE and Red Hat.
  - Red Hat also notes that a similar vulnerability (CVE-2017-13720) affects the processing of other fields of the PCF file.
