Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-13139:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read that occurs when processing a crafted MNG image file, specifically within the `CLIP` chunk. This indicates a flaw in how ImageMagick handles object IDs within the MNG `CLIP` chunk.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer when processing MNG CLIP chunks, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- While not explicitly stated as arbitrary code execution, the out-of-bounds read could lead to:
  - **Denial of Service:** By causing the application to crash.
  - **Information Disclosure:** By potentially reading data from adjacent memory.

**Attack vectors:**

- The primary attack vector involves enticing a user or an automated system to process a specially crafted MNG image file containing a malicious `CLIP` chunk with out-of-range object IDs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious image file to be processed by ImageMagick, this could be via:
  - User interaction (e.g., user opening the malicious image).
  - Automated processing (e.g., a server that processes uploaded or fetched images).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick version `8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-15`.
- The fix involves skipping MNG CLIP chunks with out-of-range object IDs.
- The specific code change was in `coders/png.c`, which handles MNG format. The relevant commit is `d072ed6aff835c174e856ce3a428163c0da9e8f4`.
- The vulnerability exists in multiple versions of ImageMagick, including `8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u8`, `8:6.7.7.10-5+deb9u1`, `8:6.7.7.10-5+deb7u14`, and `8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-13`, `8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u9`
