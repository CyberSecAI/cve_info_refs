Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13273:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The provided text indicates that CVE-2017-13273 is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability found in the Linux kernel related to the multi-queue block I/O subsystem. Specifically, it's a race condition within the block layer.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in a race condition between the timeout handler and the freeing of a request. The `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` function is called within the timeout handler to retrieve a request using a tag. However, the request could potentially be freed at any moment. This can result in `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` accessing freed memory, potentially leading to a kernel panic (oops). The issue arises because the flush request can share the same tag as a cloned request, but these two requests cannot be active simultaneously.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core vulnerability is a race condition that occurs when a request is being freed and simultaneously being accessed through its tag by the timeout handler.
*   **Use-After-Free:** Due to the race condition, `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` may access the request after it has been freed, which is a classic use-after-free vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** As per the Android Security Bulletin, this vulnerability allows for a local privilege escalation.
*  **Kernel Panic/Denial of Service (DoS):** The direct impact is a kernel panic (oops), leading to a denial of service. This may also result in a system crash and potential data loss if not properly handled by the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Malicious Application:** A local application can trigger this race condition to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **Ability to Trigger I/O Operations**: The attacker needs to perform operations that trigger timeouts on block devices to cause the race condition.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` function.
*   The fix involved modifying how flush requests share tags with cloned requests to avoid concurrent access, updating `tags->rqs[tag]` with the current request (either the flush request or the cloned request). This ensures the request associated with a tag is always valid when accessed.
*   The `bt_for_each()` helper function was also updated. The vulnerable `blk_mq_tag_to_rq` call was replaced by accessing the request directly through `tags->rqs[tag]`. This implies that the caller should ensure the request is not freed.
*   The fix is done by updating `tags->rqs[tag]` to point to the currently active request (either flush request or cloned request).

**Patch Information:**
The patch for this vulnerability is located in the following commit:
[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0048b4837affd153897ed1222283492070027aa9](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0048b4837affd153897ed1222283492070027aa9).

**Additional Notes:**

The provided commit log and the Android Security Bulletin entry provide a good level of detail regarding the nature of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
The commit message provides the following information:

*   The `blk_mq_tag_to_rq` function is used to retrieve a request from a tag within the timeout handler, but this is incorrect as the request can be freed anytime.
*   The flush request may share a tag with a cloned request, but only one of them can be active at a time.
*   The patch updates `tags->rqs[tag]` with the active request (either flush or cloned request).
*   The `blk_mq_tag_to_rq` function is simplified with this patch.
*  The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that the tag always points to a valid request, either the original or the flush request and not to a freed one.

**Summary**

The vulnerability CVE-2017-13273 is a race condition in the Linux kernel's block I/O layer that allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially escalate privileges by exploiting use-after-free condition in `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` function. The patch involved updating the request association for tags.
