Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13287:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The commit message `Fix VerifyCredentialResponse parcelling code` and the bug reference `Bug: 71714464` in the first document, matches the CVE-2017-13287 which references the same bug ID. This confirms that the provided content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an "asymmetry between parcelling and unparcelling" in the `VerifyCredentialResponse` object, specifically related to how it's handled in a `Parcel`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion:** The primary vulnerability is type confusion during the process of parcelling and unparcelling the `VerifyCredentialResponse` object.
- The issue arises when this object is packaged with other objects in a Parcel.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- The type confusion could lead to an Elevation of Privilege (EoP). 
- This may allow a malicious application to bypass intended restrictions or access data they shouldn't normally be able to.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious application could create a crafted parcel containing the vulnerable `VerifyCredentialResponse` object along with other objects. 
- This would be passed to a service that processes this `Parcel`, triggering the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to create and send a crafted Parcel to a vulnerable service. This generally means that a malicious app would have to be installed on the device to initiate the attack.
- The attacker likely needs to have the ability to interact with the affected components that use parcelling of the `VerifyCredentialResponse` object.

**Additional Notes**

- The fix addresses the asymmetry between how the `VerifyCredentialResponse` object is written to and read from a Parcel, preventing the type confusion issue.

- The provided information suggests that this vulnerability exists in the Android framework and affects a range of Android versions from 6.0.1 to 8.1.
