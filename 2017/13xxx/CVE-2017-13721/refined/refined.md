Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the X Shared Memory (SHM) extension within the X.Org server. Specifically, the `ProcShmCreateSegment` function did not properly validate the resource ID of the shared memory segment (`shmseg`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Resource ID Validation:** The code did not check if the provided shared memory segment ID was associated with an existing client, leading to the possibility of using an ID of a non-existing client or overwriting an existing segment of another client.
- **Resource Confusion/Overwrite:** Due to the lack of validation, a malicious client could potentially specify a shared memory segment ID that's either invalid (belonging to a non-existing client) or belongs to another client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By using an ID of non-existing client, the server could abort with a FatalError "client not in use", leading to a crash and denial of service.
- **Shared Memory Overwrite:** A malicious client could overwrite an existing shared memory segment of another client. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or data corruption, depending on how the shared memory is used by other clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to have a client application that is able to connect to the X server.
- **X Server Interaction:** The attacker manipulates the X server by using the X Shared Memory extension and crafting malicious requests when creating or accessing shared memory segments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to connect to the X server (typically, this is a local user on the system).
- The attacker must be able to send specific requests to the X server using the X SHM extension.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a `LEGAL_NEW_RESOURCE(stuff->shmseg, client)` check within the `ProcShmCreateSegment` function in `Xext/shm.c`. This ensures that the resource ID is valid before proceeding, preventing the issue.
- The vulnerability is fixed in xorg-server version 1.19.4 and later.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Michal Srb of SuSE.
- The fix was integrated by Julien Cristau of Debian.
- The vulnerability is described as a local attack, meaning that the attacker needs to be able to connect to the X server to exploit this vulnerability.
