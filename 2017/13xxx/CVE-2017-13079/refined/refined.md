Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13079:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents directly reference CVE-2017-13079 and describe it as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities discovered in WPA/WPA2. The official description is: "Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that supports IEEE 802.11w allows reinstallation of the Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) during the four-way handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to spoof frames from access points to clients."

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:
    *   The vulnerability stems from ambiguities in the processing of 802.11i 4-way handshake messages. Specifically, the IGTK (Integrity Group Temporal Key) can be reinstalled during the 4-way handshake due to an improper handling of messages.
    *   The root cause is within the WPA2 protocol standard itself, leading to a key reinstallation vulnerability when handling specific message sequences.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Key Reinstallation**: The main vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to force the reinstallation of a previously used integrity group key (IGTK) during the WPA/WPA2 handshake. This occurs due to ambiguities in processing handshake messages.
    *   **Ambiguous Message Handling**: The weakness lies in the way devices handle and process 4-way handshake messages, allowing the possibility of reinstalling keys.
    *   The vulnerability is present in both supplicant (client) and authenticator (access point) implementations of WPA/WPA2.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Spoofing**: An attacker can spoof frames from access points to clients, meaning they can inject and manipulate network packets, potentially leading to malicious actions.
    *   **Loss of Data Integrity**: This is accomplished by replaying or resending certain handshake messages to get the victim to reinstall a key that's already in use. This can cause replay counters to reset, thereby allowing an attacker to inject or replay packets.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: By achieving a man-in-the-middle position, the attacker can intercept, decrypt (in some scenarios), and inject forged network packets into the wireless communication.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Position**: The attacker must be within radio range of both the wireless client and access point. They establish an intermediary position to intercept and manipulate the handshake messages between the two parties.
    *   **Message Retransmission**: Attackers exploit the retransmission mechanism in the handshake process to force a key reinstallation.
    *   **Replay of Handshake Messages:** The vulnerability is exploited by retransmitting previously used message exchanges between the supplicant and authenticator.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Proximity**: The attacker must be within the radio range of the vulnerable client and access point.
    *   **Unauthenticated**: The attacker does not need prior authentication or credentials to the Wi-Fi network.
    *   **Packet Interception**: The attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and the access point to carry out the key reinstallation.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   **Specific Affected Implementations**: The vulnerability affects implementations of both *hostapd* (access point) and *wpa\_supplicant* (client).
*   **Patching**: The content emphasizes that fixes must be applied to both the client and the access point to fully mitigate the issue. Applying fixes only on one side is not sufficient for complete protection.
*   **Mitigations**: The content references several workarounds including:
    * Limiting the number of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) over LAN (EAPoL) key retries.
    * Disabling the 11r (fast BSS transition) support if not needed.
    * Configuration of WPA2-CCMP (AES) instead of WPA2-TKIP or WPA-GCMP to reduce the risk of potential attacks.
    * Disabling “MeshConnex” or “Client Bridge Mode” on certain devices.
*   **Vendor Responses**: The advisories from various vendors (Cisco, SUSE, Siemens, Red Hat, Debian, Gentoo, etc) confirm that their products are affected by one or more of the KRACK vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-13079. The provided documents indicate that fixes were being made available by many of these vendors.
*  **Packet Number Reuse**:  The vulnerability can lead to packet number reuse, breaking replay protection mechanisms, and can allow the attacker to replay or inject packets with the reused sequence numbers.
*  **WNM Sleep Mode Response**: The reinstallation of GTK or IGTK when processing Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frames can also be exploited by an attacker.

**Additional Information Beyond the CVE description**:

*   The provided documents, especially from Cisco and w1.fi, offer a detailed explanation of how the attack works by exploiting the handshake process and triggering key reinstallation. These documents describe the specifics of message manipulation and resulting vulnerabilities.
*  The description of the impact includes the potential for spoofing frames from access points to clients which goes beyond what's mentioned in the formal CVE.
*  Some descriptions mention that the attack is possible on all WPA/WPA2 networks (personal and enterprise), regardless of the cipher used, and is not limited to networks using TKIP, which is a more serious issue than described in the official CVE.

In summary, the content provides a good analysis of the CVE-2017-13079, outlining the root cause, affected components, attack vectors, potential impact, and mitigation strategies. It also adds details beyond the initial CVE definition by including vendor responses, implementation specific details, and various workarounds.
