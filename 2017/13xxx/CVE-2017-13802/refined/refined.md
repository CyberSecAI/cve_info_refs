Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-13802:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Multiple memory corruption issues were present in WebKit.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in `WebCore::Style::TreeResolver::styleForElement`. Specifically, a `RenderStyle` object is freed during the `resolveComposedTree` operation, and later accessed by `parentBoxStyle()`, leading to a use-after-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of service (as indicated by the exploit-db entry).

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing maliciously crafted web content. This means an attacker could embed malicious code within a webpage or a web document that, when processed by a vulnerable application, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to process the malicious web content. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious website, sending a malicious link, or through other means of delivering web content to a vulnerable application (e.g., via embedded web views).

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML code that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability. It involves manipulating the DOM with elements like `keygen`, `animate`, `text`, `font`, `select`, `textarea`, and `iframe`, utilizing event handlers, scrolling, and focus mechanisms. This PoC specifically targets the function `WebCore::Style::TreeResolver::styleForElement`.
*   The vulnerability is present in WebKit, affecting Safari, iTunes for Windows, iCloud for Windows, tvOS, and iOS.
*   The issue was addressed by improved memory handling.

In summary, CVE-2017-13802 is a use-after-free vulnerability within WebKit that can be triggered by processing malicious web content, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.
