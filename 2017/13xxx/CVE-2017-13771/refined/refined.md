Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Lexmark "Scan to Network" (SNF) application storing network credentials in plaintext. This occurs in versions prior to 3.7.6. The application is an embedded Java application installed on multifunction printers (MFPs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The primary weakness is the storage of network credentials in plaintext within the application's configuration.
*   **Information Exposure:** These plaintext credentials are transmitted during requests to the configuration tab and can also be extracted via the application's configuration export functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Network Credentials:** Attackers can gain access to network usernames and passwords, which could be used to escalate privileges or access scanned documents stored on the network.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials can provide unauthorized access to network resources and potentially lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request to Configuration Tab:** By sending a POST request to the `snfDestServlet` endpoint and accessing the edit functionality, an attacker can retrieve the plaintext credentials from the HTML response.
*   **Configuration Export:** By using the application's export function, an attacker can obtain a base64-encoded password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Printer's Web Interface:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable printer's web interface.
*   **Knowledge of Printer's IP Address/Hostname:** The attacker needs to know the network address of the printer to send requests.
*   **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with low privileges on the printer's web interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Daniel Correa and publicly disclosed after the vendor did not respond to the initial notification.
* The vulnerability affects "All versions of the 'Scan to Network' application prior to 3.7.6".
*   The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 base score of 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N), indicating a medium severity.
