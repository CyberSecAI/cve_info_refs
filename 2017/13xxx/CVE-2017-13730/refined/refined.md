{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An illegal address access occurs within the `_nc_read_entry_source` function in `tic.c` of the ncurses library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability stems from how ncurses handles specially crafted terminfo data.",
      "Specifically, crafted input with certain illegal characters and incorrect capability types passed to the `tic` utility triggers the vulnerability in the `_nc_read_entry_source` function."
     ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash. Although not explicitly stated, this could be leveraged by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves processing a crafted terminfo file using the `tic` utility.",
       "An attacker can provide a specially crafted terminfo file as input to the tic tool."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted terminfo file to the affected system.",
       "The ability to execute the `tic` utility with the crafted input."
    ]
  },
  "additional_notes": [
      "The provided bug report includes a crash log, showing a segmentation fault during the execution of the vulnerable code.",
     "The bug report includes a proof of concept (POC) file, named `POC9` that can trigger the vulnerability.",
      "The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of terminfo entries. The parser mishandles specific illegal characters, and wrong types used for capabilities. It was noted that tic.c is not a library function, but a utility.",
      "The Gentoo security advisory GLSA 201804-13 groups this CVE with other vulnerabilities in ncurses, indicating that multiple issues were addressed in the same update."
