Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13199:

**CVE-2017-13199**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from an issue within the `BitMap.nativeCreate` function when handling native allocations, specifically related to how the system reacts when memory allocation fails.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. When `Bitmap.nativeCreate` fails, the system did not handle the error properly.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The failure of `Bitmap.nativeCreate` can lead to a denial-of-service. The original behavior prior to the fix could result in a `NullPointerException` in Java code or potentially other unpredictable behaviors depending on how the error was handled.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves triggering the creation of a bitmap in a way that causes memory allocation to fail in `BitMap.nativeCreate`.  The specific method of triggering this is not detailed.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to trigger bitmap creation, which might be possible through crafted applications or specific file formats that would be processed by affected media components.

**Technical Details from Code Commit:**

*   The commit message for the fix explains that the original behavior, prior to switching from Java-allocated memory to native allocations for bitmaps, did not handle native allocation failures gracefully.  The fix is described as matching the old behavior, where if `Bitmap.nativeCreate` failed, an `OutOfMemoryError` should be thrown.
*   The fix implements a change to throw the OOME if the native allocation fails.
*   The fix also includes a test case (`I6ab6cb7a3b3151641a9f9b02b0bfc484e0a4524b`) to prevent regressions.

**Additional Notes:**
*  The fix ensures that a failed native allocation in  `BitMap.nativeCreate` will now throw an `OutOfMemoryError` instead of leading to a `NullPointerException` or other undefined behavior.
