Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-13298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to how the `log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4` parameter is handled within the media framework. This parameter should be within the range of 0 to 12 inclusive, according to the specification. An incorrect value could lead to a crash or other issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code doesn't properly validate the `log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4` parameter, allowing values outside the allowed range. This lack of validation is the core weakness, which can be triggered through malicious media files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. An attacker can craft a malicious media file with an invalid `log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4` value that causes the system to crash or become unresponsive while processing the file.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability also allows for Information Disclosure (ID). This may mean the attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information in memory or through the processing errors caused by the invalid parameter.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Media Files:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted media file to the system. The malicious file is processed by the media framework, triggering the vulnerability due to the invalid `log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4` value.
- **Processing Malicious Streams:** This could also happen while processing malicious media streams.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious media file or stream to the affected Android device. This could be done through various means, like a malicious app, a website, or by sending a malicious media file through a messaging app.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges. The vulnerability can be triggered by a standard media processing attempt.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Android versions (6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1), although the impact may differ between them.
- The fix involves implementing proper input validation to ensure the `log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4` parameter stays within the correct range.
- The vulnerability is categorized as having both Moderate (Information Disclosure) and High (Denial of Service) severity levels.
