Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13323:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the system core component. Specifically, the commit message states "String16: remove integer overflows".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow when handling String16 objects. This likely occurs when calculating sizes or offsets, potentially leading to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior due to the incorrect size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The security bulletin categorizes this as an EoP vulnerability, meaning a successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than intended.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The provided information doesn't give specifics on the exact attack vector. However, the vulnerability lies within a core system component so the attack would likely involve crafting specific inputs or data to trigger the integer overflow within the String16 object handling, then leveraging this vulnerability to escalate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need the ability to provide input that can trigger the integer overflow condition within the String16 handling routines. This likely requires an attacker to have a position within the affected system and control over data that would be used in string operations.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided commit message indicates a fix for "String16: remove integer overflows". This further clarifies that the vulnerability is directly related to how String16 objects are managed.
*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of Android versions, from 6.0 to 8.1.
