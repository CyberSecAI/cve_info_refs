Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13062:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak vulnerability exists in the `WriteMETAImage` function within the `coders/meta.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, the leak occurs in the `formatIPTC` function which is called by `WriteMETAImage` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The `formatIPTC` function allocates memory, but this allocated memory is not freed properly when processing certain crafted image files, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): Repeatedly processing crafted files can exhaust available memory, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted image files: An attacker can create specially crafted image files that, when processed by ImageMagick, trigger the memory leak in `WriteMETAImage`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted image file to a user or automated system that uses ImageMagick to process it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Github content provides a detailed stack trace of where the memory leak occurs. It also includes a link to a test case demonstrating the vulnerability, which offers more detail than the CVE description.
- The Gentoo security advisory provides a list of CVEs fixed in the same update, which includes CVE-2017-13062, and notes the impact as a denial of service.
- The Ubuntu security notice also mentions that processing malformed image files can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution. It is noted that multiple CVEs are fixed in the same update, including CVE-2017-13062. It also mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution although this is not explicitly mentioned as part of CVE-2017-13062 in other sources.
