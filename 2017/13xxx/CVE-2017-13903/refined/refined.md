A message handling issue in HomeKit allowed for the exposure of sensitive data, such as HomeKit accessory information and encryption keys, over insecure sessions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure handling of messages.
- Lack of proper input validation.
- Exposure of sensitive data (accessory information and encryption keys) over insecure channels.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could unexpectedly alter the application state, potentially gaining unauthorized control of HomeKit accessories, including locks, cameras, and lights.
- Unauthorized access to and control of HomeKit devices.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted messages to vulnerable HomeKit devices.
- Exploiting insecure sessions used to transmit HomeKit data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability with "some basic tech know-how."
- Initially, the vulnerability was exploited via Apple Watches running watchOS 4.0 or 4.1, and later, unauthorized iOS 11.2 devices could also receive the sensitive data, broadening the attack surface.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was initially discovered by a developer named Tian Zhang ("Khaos Tian") in October 2017.
* Apple's initial attempts to fix the issue widened the attack surface.
* Apple did not respond to Tian's vulnerability report, which resulted in public disclosure of the vulnerability via 9to5Mac, leading to a fix in iOS 11.2.1 and tvOS 11.2.1.
* The article highlights the lack of responsiveness from Apple's Product Security team compared to the PR team.
