Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13191:

**CVE Description:**
The CVE description is not provided in the prompt, but the vulnerability details are present.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a denial-of-service issue within the `libhevc` library, which is used for handling HEVC (High-Efficiency Video Coding) video files. Specifically, there's a flaw in how the library processes certain malformed or crafted HEVC video streams.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
- The vulnerability exists due to how `libhevc` parses the video data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service. Specifically, processing a malicious HEVC file will cause the media framework to crash or become unresponsive, potentially impacting overall system functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted HEVC video file. This could occur through various means, such as a malicious app, website or via a video file sent through messaging.
- It's a remote attack vector since the attacker only needs to supply a crafted file, and it does not require direct access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a malicious HEVC file to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in the 2018-01-01 security patch level and impacts multiple Android versions ranging from 5.1.1 to 8.1.
- The vulnerability is fixed via a code change in the AOSP repository
(https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libhevc/%2B/f5b2fa243b4c45a4cd885e85f49ae548ab88c264).
- Another commit (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libhevc/+/52ca619511acbd542d843df1f92f858ce13048a5) is listed for CVE-2017-13192 and also has a reference to the bug id (64380403) which is the same as CVE-2017-13191.
