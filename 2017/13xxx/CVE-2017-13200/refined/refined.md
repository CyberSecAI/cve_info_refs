{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "In MPEG1, the valid range for the forward and backward f_code parameters is [1,7]. Without a check, the value could be 0. The code reads (f_code - 1) bits from the stream, and reading a negative number of bits is undefined.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service due to reading a negative number of bits, which can lead to undefined behavior and crashes.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted MPEG1 stream with a f_code parameter set to 0.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to provide a malicious MPEG1 stream for processing."
  },
  "additional_details": "The fix adds a check to ensure that the f_code parameter is within the valid range of [1, 7]."
