Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13193:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the handling of slice addresses within the libhevc library when processing pictures. Specifically, the parameter `slice address` is parsed only for slices that are not the first slice in a picture, and the value cannot be zero.  If an unsupported resolution is encountered, the bytes associated with the slice are not properly consumed, leading to a potential denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper parsing of slice addresses
- Failure to consume bytes for unsupported resolutions

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). An attacker could potentially trigger an infinite loop or cause the application to crash by feeding it crafted SPS data with unsupported resolutions, and the application would repeatedly try to decode the corrupted data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted HEVC file containing SPS data with an unsupported resolution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HEVC file to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges or access is required beyond the ability to provide an input stream to the application.
