Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `mediadrmserver` component of Android. Specifically, it's triggered when the input buffer is exhausted, and a picture hasn't been fully decoded yet. In this scenario, the multi-threaded decoder could read beyond the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure issue. Reading beyond allocated buffer boundaries can expose sensitive data present in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Exploitation could lead to an information disclosure. An attacker may be able to read parts of memory that should not be accessible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves providing a malformed media input that leads to an exhausted input buffer, which causes the multi-threaded decoder to read beyond allocated memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted media input to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is provided in the linked commit: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/b41a527176b659c5ddfc734838df7607a6af80c9](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/b41a527176b659c5ddfc734838df7607a6af80c9)
*   This issue affects Android versions 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2 and 8.0
