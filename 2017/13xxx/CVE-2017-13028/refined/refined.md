{
  "CVE-2017-13028": {
    "Metadata": {
      "State": "Final",
       "Description": "The BOOTP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-bootp.c:bootp_print()."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `bootp_print()` function within `print-bootp.c` when parsing BOOTP packets.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer over-read"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution through a crafted BOOTP packet.",
       "Attack vector": "Network",
      "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to send a crafted BOOTP packet to a vulnerable system running tcpdump.",
       "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of BOOTP packets. The fix includes a bounds check to prevent reading beyond the buffer."
    }
  }
