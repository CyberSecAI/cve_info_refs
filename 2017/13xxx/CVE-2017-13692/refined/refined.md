The content is related to a bug report for `tidy-html5` which resulted in a segmentation fault.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `ISURLCodePoint` function in `attrs.c`. The function attempts to check if a given character `c` is alphanumeric using `ISALNUM(c)`. However, the value of `c` can become an unexpectedly large number (e.g., 712380 in the provided case), which causes a segmentation fault when `ISALNUM(c)` is called.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:** The code assumes that character values are within a valid range, which is not true when processing malformed input. The `ISALNUM` macro, when given the large integer `c`, attempts to access memory locations outside of what's valid leading to the segfault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malformed HTML input can cause the application to crash due to a segmentation fault.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The attack is triggered by providing a crafted or malformed HTML input to the tidy-html5 parser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to `tidy-html5`. No special privileges or network access is required to trigger the vulnerability.
