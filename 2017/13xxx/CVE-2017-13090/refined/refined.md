{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `retr.c:fd_read_body()` function in `wget` does not validate the chunk size received in a chunked HTTP response. Specifically, it uses `strtol()` to parse the chunk length but doesn't check if the parsed length is non-negative. When a negative length is passed, it leads to an integer overflow when the chunk is read via `retr.c:fd_read()`, causing memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution by corrupting malloc metadata after the allocated buffer. The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine or cause a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious HTTP server can send a crafted chunked response with a negative chunk length, which triggers the vulnerability when wget processes the response.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or have access to a malicious HTTP server that a user running a vulnerable version of wget will connect to."
