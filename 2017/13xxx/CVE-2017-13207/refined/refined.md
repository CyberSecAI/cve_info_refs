{
  "CVE-2017-13207": {
    "Root cause": "Out-of-bounds memory access in the `GetIntvInt()` function when processing malicious content. The index used to access the `invCount` array is not validated, allowing an attacker to read memory outside of the array's bounds.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure due to reading arbitrary memory locations. The content is decoded with \"stagefright -s -a\"",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted media file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted media file to the vulnerable device."
