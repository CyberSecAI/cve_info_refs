  "cveId": "CVE-2017-13044",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "The HNCP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read vulnerability in print-hncp.c:dhcpv4_print().",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check in the `dhcpv4_print()` function within `print-hncp.c`, which parses DHCPv4 data in HNCP packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read (CWE-125)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trigger a buffer over-read by crafting a malicious HNCP packet with a specially crafted DHCPv4 data section. This can lead to denial of service, and potentially, arbitrary code execution.",
     "attackVectors": [
        "Network"
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump and trigger the parsing of a malicious HNCP packet.",
     "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability was discovered by Bhargava Shastry, SecT/TU Berlin. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the program does not attempt to read past the end of the data buffer."
