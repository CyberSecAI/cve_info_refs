Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-13796:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability within WebKit's `WebCore::TreeScope::documentScope`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free (UAF): The vulnerability arises when a memory location is accessed after it has been freed. Specifically, the `documentScope` is being accessed after the associated document has been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates a crash due to the UAF.
-  The Apple security advisories also state that processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through processing maliciously crafted web content. This can be triggered by enticing a victim to visit a website with the exploit payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve the malicious web content to a user running a vulnerable version of WebKit. This could be achieved through a malicious website, an injected script or other means of serving web content.
- No special attacker positioning or privileges are required beyond being able to serve web content.

**Additional details from the exploit-db.com content:**

- The exploit-db content provides the following information:
    - A proof-of-concept (PoC) code that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability. The PoC involves creating a document, manipulating its elements, and then attempting to access the freed document scope.
    - A stack trace from AddressSanitizer showing the exact location of the use-after-free in `WebCore::TreeScope::documentScope`.
    - The vulnerability was confirmed on an ASan build of WebKit nightly.
    - It was discovered by Google Security Research.
