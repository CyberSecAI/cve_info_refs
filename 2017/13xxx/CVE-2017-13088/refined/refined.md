Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13088:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided documents discuss vulnerabilities related to WPA2, specifically mentioning CVE-2017-13088. The content from `bugzilla.suse.com`, `security.gentoo.org`, `www.suse.com`, `lists.opensuse.org` and `www.krackattacks.com` directly confirm this. The advisory from `cert-portal.siemens.com` lists CVE-2017-13088 as one of the impacted vulnerabilities. The RedHat content, from `access.redhat.com` also confirms this. All these sources confirm the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a flaw in how WPA/WPA2 implementations handle the reinstallation of the Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) during Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frames. This is a protocol-level issue that affects multiple implementations.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Key Reinstallation:** The core weakness is the ability of an attacker to force the reinstallation of the IGTK. This is done by manipulating the timing and transmission of management frames related to group keys and sleep mode. This reinstallation resets replay counters, which weakens security.
    *   **WNM Sleep Mode Handling**: Specifically related to CVE-2017-13088, the vulnerability is triggered when processing WNM Sleep Mode Response frames

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Frame Replay:** An attacker within radio range of the vulnerable AP and client can replay frames from access points to clients. 
        *   The attacker does not gain the ability to decrypt unicast traffic
    *   **Spoofing:** The ability to reinstall the IGTK also allows for the attacker to spoof frames from APs to clients.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker needs to be within radio range of both the access point and the client. They need to be able to manipulate the flow of traffic between the two (specifically, delay or replay frames).
    *   **Replay of WNM Response Frames**: By replaying a WNM Sleep Mode Response frame.

*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within radio range of the target wireless network, close enough to intercept and manipulate wireless traffic.
    *   **Manipulation of Frames:** The attacker must be capable of capturing and retransmitting frames of the WPA2 handshake, particularly the WNM Sleep Mode Response.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The `www.krackattacks.com` content provides a detailed explanation of the KRACK attack and key reinstallation concept. It also specifies that the vulnerability is in the Wi-Fi standard itself, not individual implementations.
*   The `bugzilla.suse.com` content provides links to commits that address this vulnerability.
*   The `security.gentoo.org` content includes the affected versions of `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant`.
*   The `www.suse.com` content details the SUSE impact including specific vulnerable products and fix versions.
*   The `www.redhat.com` content explains their severity rating system along with how they handle CVEs
*   The `cert-portal.siemens.com` content details the vulnerability in the context of industrial devices.
*   The `lists.opensuse.org` and `lists.ubuntu.com` contain information about security updates.
*  The `source.android.com` content points to the Android Security Bulletin which mentions the fix for CVE-2017-13088 in their 2017-11-06 security patch level

**4. Content details vs CVE description:**

The content provides significantly more technical detail than a typical CVE description. It describes how the vulnerability is exploited using replayed management frames, what the impact of such exploitation is (frame replay and spoofing), and how the vulnerabilities can be mitigated. The content from `www.krackattacks.com` provides details about the key reinstallation attack concept in general. The other content details how vendors are addressing the issue.

**Conclusion:**

The provided content is highly relevant to CVE-2017-13088. It details the root cause, attack vectors, impact, and necessary conditions for the exploit, going beyond a generic CVE description and explaining the vulnerability in detail.

**Response: RELEVANT**
