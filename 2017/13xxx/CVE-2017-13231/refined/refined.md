Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-13231:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the handling of shared buffer sizes within the Android media framework. The provided commit message "cas: validate shared buffer size before using" suggests that the vulnerability arises due to a lack of proper validation of the size of shared buffers before they are accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Validation:** The core issue is the absence of, or inadequate, validation of shared buffer sizes before they are used. This can lead to out-of-bounds read or write operations if the buffer size is not what the accessing code expects.
- **Potential for Memory Corruption:**  If an attacker can control the reported size of the shared buffer to be smaller than the actual size, it could lead to writing past the allocated buffer. If the attacker can control the reported size to be larger than the actual size, it could lead to out-of-bounds reads. Either scenario can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability is classified as an Elevation of Privilege. This implies a local attacker may exploit this flaw to elevate privileges, potentially gaining control over processes that normally have higher access levels.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** By corrupting memory an attacker might be able to eventually achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of a privileged process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific media file or data stream that manipulates shared buffer sizes in a way that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Media framework:** The attack is targeted at the Media framework, which handles decoding and processing of multimedia data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to install and execute a malicious application on the device.
- **Ability to Craft Media:** The attacker needs the capability to create a specially crafted media file or data stream that can cause the affected code to perform an out of bounds read or write due to the lack of shared buffer size validation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message "validate shared buffer size before using" is more descriptive than the original CVE description which is just a placeholder, providing better information to understand the root cause.
*   The provided links to code changes provide additional context, allowing to understand the fix implemented.
*   The bulletin categorizes the severity as High, meaning the potential impact is severe if the vulnerability is successfully exploited.
