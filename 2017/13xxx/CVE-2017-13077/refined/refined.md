Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-13077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how WPA/WPA2 protocols handle the reinstallation of the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) during the 4-way handshake. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the fact that a system can be tricked into reinstalling an already-in-use key by manipulating handshake messages, thus also causing a reset in nonce values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Key Reinstallation:** The core weakness is the ability to force a system (client or access point) to reinstall an encryption key that is already in use. This can be triggered by replaying specific frames used in key management protocols.
*   **Nonce Reuse:** Reinstalling the encryption key can reset the associated packet number (nonce), leading to reuse of these values. This breaks replay protection on the receive side and can cause issues on the transmit side.
*   **Lack of Proper State Management:** The vulnerability exists due to ambiguities in the processing of associated protocol messages, where state transitions aren't handled correctly. This improper state management allows for replayed frames to be accepted as valid for initiating the key exchange.
*   **Ambiguity in processing of retransmitted handshake messages** allows an attacker to trick a vulnerable system to reuse an encryption key, which in turn permits the attacker to decrypt and inject packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Decryption:** An attacker can decrypt previously sent frames due to nonce reuse and key reinstallation. This enables the attacker to potentially intercept sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, chat messages, emails, photos, and more.
*   **Injection:** For some vulnerable systems (especially when using WPA-TKIP or GCMP), the attacker can not only decrypt frames but also forge and inject new packets, potentially injecting malware or ransomware.
*   **TCP Hijacking:** Attackers can use decrypted TCP SYN packets to hijack TCP connections and inject malicious traffic into unencrypted protocols such as HTTP.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** By forcing key reinstallation, an attacker can achieve a man-in-the-middle position allowing for decryption of data, and forging of packets in either or both directions of a communication channel.
*   **Confidentiality Loss:** Overall the attacker can break the confidentiality of the WPA/WPA2 encrypted communications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the radio range of the targeted Wi-Fi network to intercept and manipulate the traffic.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** An attacker needs to position themselves to intercept and manipulate traffic between the access point and a vulnerable client. This may require creating a fake AP, or intercepting traffic between two real devices.
*   **Frame Manipulation:** Exploiting the vulnerability involves manipulating the 4-way handshake by replaying previously seen authentication messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** Attacker must be within Wi-Fi range.
*   **Monitoring Ability:** Attacker must be able to sniff and capture Wi-Fi traffic.
*   **Packet Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to selectively delay, retransmit or replay network packets from the 4-way handshake or related protocols.

In summary, CVE-2017-13077 is a critical vulnerability because it allows an attacker within wireless range to compromise WPA2 encryption using a key reinstallation attack. This can lead to data decryption and injection, depending on which encryption protocol is being used. Successful exploitation requires the attacker to be nearby and to be able to manipulate key exchange messages, leading to session key reuse which then breaks the security and encryption properties of WPA/WPA2.
