Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from ImageMagick's incorrect handling of certain malformed image files. Specifically, a memory leak was found in the `WritePCXImage` function within `coders/pcx.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak: The `WritePCXImage` function allocates memory but fails to free it, leading to a memory leak. This is triggered by a specially crafted PCX image file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By repeatedly processing a crafted image file, an attacker can cause a memory leak that leads to resource exhaustion and DoS.
- Possible Code Execution: The Ubuntu security notice mentions "possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program," however, the provided technical details from the github issue #666 only describe a memory leak.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Image File: The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into opening a specially crafted image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PCX image file to a system or user using ImageMagick. This could be through email, websites, or other means.
- No special privileges or access to the vulnerable system is required besides the ability to provide a malicious image file to be processed.

**Additional Details:**
- The GitHub issue #666 provides a code snippet showing the memory leak reported by AddressSanitizer, which further clarifies the vulnerable code and allocation.
- The Gentoo security advisory indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, and that multiple CVEs are fixed in the same update, including CVE-2017-13058.
