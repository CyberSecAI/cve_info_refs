Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13277:

**CVE-2017-13277**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `libhevc` library, specifically a failure to properly check the output buffer size.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** A parameter `wd` used in output buffer size check is set to a value larger than `disp_wd` and `disp_strd` leading to a buffer overflow.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** This can lead to remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this by using a specially crafted file. The specific file format is HEVC.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HEVC file to the targeted device. This could potentially be through a variety of methods including malicious websites, email attachments, or other app-mediated file transfers.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided commit message mentions "Fix output buffer size check" and references the bug ID 72165027, further solidifying that this commit addresses CVE-2017-13277.
*   The Android Security Bulletin mentions CVE-2017-13277 under the "Media framework" section and categorizes it as a "RCE" (Remote Code Execution) with "Critical" severity.
*   The fix involves adjusting the parameter `wd` to the correct `disp_wd` and `disp_strd` values.
