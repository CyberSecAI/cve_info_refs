Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13878:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking in the `AppleIntelCapriController::getDisplayPipeCapability` function within the Intel Graphics Driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The function reads an attacker-controlled 32-bit value from a userclient structure's input buffer. This value is then used to index an array of pointers, without proper validation. This allows reading memory outside the intended bounds of the array.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Memory Disclosure:** By controlling the index value, an attacker can read arbitrary kernel memory, potentially disclosing sensitive information.
*   **System Instability:** While not explicitly mentioned, the potential to read from arbitrary memory locations could lead to crashes, or other unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack is performed locally, requiring an application to interact with the vulnerable function through the IOKit interface.
*   **UserClient Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered through the userclient interface to `IntelFBClientControl`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the target machine.
*   The attacker needs to interact with the `IntelFBClientControl` service through the IOKit API, using `IOConnectCallMethod`.
* The attacker needs to be able to control the input buffer that is used as index.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code reads a value `rax` from the input buffer, and uses it to calculate an address `rsi = [rdi + rax*8 + 0E48h]`, effectively indexing an array of pointers.
*   The code at `__text:000000000002ACE0` shows this read from the user provided buffer, without a bounds check on the value `rax`.
*   The code at `__text:000000000002ACE2` performs the memory access based on the `rax` value.
*   The code at `__text:000000000002ACF3` copies 0x1D8 bytes from the address calculated based on `rax` to an output buffer, which is then returned to userspace.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit code provided demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by crafting the input buffer.
*   The provided code includes a commented out line to trigger a crash (`*(uint64_t*)inputStruct = 0x12345678;`), and the successful disclosure with `*(uint64_t*)inputStruct = 0x37;`.
*   The vulnerability was tested on macOS 10.13 (17A365) on a MacBookAir5,2.
*   The vulnerability was found by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
*  The provided exploit code provides an example of how to leak the pointers, by reading the outputStruct, after the IOKit call and parsing the pointer out of the returned data.

This information provides a good overview of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and how it can be exploited. The provided source code offers a clear example of the attack and the affected code location within the kernel.
