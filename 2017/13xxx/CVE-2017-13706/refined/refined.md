Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This occurs because the Lansweeper application processes XML input containing references to external entities without proper sanitization or configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The application's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE attacks. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML containing references to external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Data Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the server's file system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** It might be possible to cause a denial of service by exploiting the vulnerable XML parsing.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker could potentially use the server to make requests to other internal or external systems, which could lead to further attacks.
*  **Port Scanning:** An attacker could perform port scanning from the perspective of the server where the parser is located.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a POST request to `/deployment/DeploymentActions.aspx?action=importPackage`.
*   The attacker crafts a malicious XML file, which includes external entity references and submits it via the 'XML' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable URL.
*   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL, as well as, a network to host the attacker controlled dtd file.
*   The attacker needs to have some understanding of XML and XXE vulnerabilities.
*   No authentication appears to be required based on the provided information.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Lansweeper version 6.0.100.29 and likely earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.0.100.67.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided in the advisory, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a variety of malicious actions, including reading files, initiating server-side requests, and potentially causing denial of service. The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
