Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2017-13876:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `__offsetof` macro used within the `posix_spawn` system call, specifically when handling the size of port actions on 32-bit platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:**  The `PS_PORT_ACTIONS_SIZE` macro, which calculates the size of port actions, uses `__offsetof` which performs simple arithmetic. This allows for the calculation to overflow when provided with a large value of `pspa_count` (number of entries in the `pspa_actions` array). The resulting size can wrap around to a smaller value that passes initial size checks.
- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** Due to the integer overflow, a kernel heap buffer allocated for port actions (`portwatch_ports`) is undersized. Subsequently, when `exec_handle_port_actions` attempts to use the `pspa_count` value that overflowed to index into `portwatch_ports`, it can result in an out-of-bounds write. The code attempts to copy data from user-space into the undersized `portwatch_ports` buffer, causing the overflow. This out-of-bounds write occurs during the handling of port actions in `exec_handle_port_actions`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could enable an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges by corrupting kernel memory with carefully crafted values.
- **Denial of Service:** The exploit can also lead to unexpected system termination due to memory corruption, which can be considered a denial of service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted `posix_spawn` system call with specific values for `port_actions_size` and `pspa_count` parameters.
- The attacker needs to control the arguments passed to the `posix_spawn` system call which allows to trigger the integer overflows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code, and call the `posix_spawn` system call. This is traditionally achievable by having local user access.
- The exploit description mentions that, on iOS, the vulnerability could be exploited through a sandbox escape. It also mentions it was tested on an Apple Watch.
-  The exploit description highlights the potential for this to be triggered via an application that calls `posix_spawn`, which ideally should not be a reachable attack surface from the app sandbox. The vulnerability is triggered before the MAC hook in `posix_spawn`.

**Additional Details:**
- The `exploit-db.com` content mentions that the `pspa_actions` array within the `_posix_spawn_port_actions` structure is a zero-sized array. The `pspa_count` field is meant to specify the number of elements within this array, which is later used in a loop, which leads to the out-of-bounds write if it overflows.
- The provided PoC fills a kalloc.1024 buffer with suitable values before freeing it and reallocating it as `pspa_actions` to control the data that's read out of bounds and used in the heap overflow.
- The issue affects 32-bit platforms.
-  The vulnerability was found by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
