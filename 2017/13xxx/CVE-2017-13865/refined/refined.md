Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13865:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from multiple validation issues within the kernel, specifically related to input sanitization. The `proc_pidlistuptrs` API, intended for debugging, has a flaw where it does not properly validate the buffer size, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The kernel API `proc_pidlistuptrs` does not enforce that the provided buffer size is a multiple of 8, which causes out-of-bounds read.
- **Memory Disclosure:** The API returns more data than what is written to the buffer, using stale memory allocated by `kalloc`, resulting in the disclosure of kernel memory.
- **Lack of Zero Initialization:** The memory allocated by `kalloc` is not zero-initialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Memory Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to read kernel memory. This can be used to defeat Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), and leak other sensitive information.
- **Local Privilege Escalation (indirect):** While not directly leading to privilege escalation, by leaking kernel memory, an attacker could potentially use this leaked information as a step toward more impactful exploits that lead to arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges
- **Information Leak:** Attackers gain access to sensitive kernel data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a local application utilizing the flawed `proc_pidlistuptrs` API.
- The vulnerability is exploitable by any application capable of calling `proc_pidlistuptrs` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to execute code on the target system as a local user.

**Technical Details:**
- The `proc_pidlistuptrs` API calculates the number of 64-bit values (uint64_t) that can fit into an attacker-provided buffer (`buffersize`). The calculation `count = buffersize / sizeof(uint64_t)` does not check if buffersize is a multiple of 8, which causes problems down the line
-  A kernel buffer is allocated using `kalloc(buffersize)`.
-  The `kevent_proc_copy_uptrs` function is called, this function returns the number of potential user space pointers found in kernel data structures (specifically `kqueues`) and copies those pointers into `kbuf`. If the number of pointers exceeds the size of kbuf, only as many pointers as kbuf allows will be written, the count will continue to increase though.
-  The calculated `copysize` (number of returned pointers * 8) is not limited by how much was actually written to `kbuf`, but rather how many could be written if it was large enough. If `copysize` is larger than `buffersize`, `copysize` is truncated back down to `buffersize`
- `copyout` copies the content of `kbuf` to user space, using `copysize` as the amount to copy. If the attacker provided a `buffersize` that is not a multiple of 8, then only part of the last 8 bytes in `kbuf` may have been written to by `kevent_proc_copy_uptrs`, leaving the remainder to retain stale kernel data from previous `kalloc` operations

**Affected Platforms:**
- macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db content provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited to leak kernel pointers.
- This vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The vulnerability was fixed by improved input sanitization in kernel.
