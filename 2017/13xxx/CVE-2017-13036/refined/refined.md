{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The OSPFv3 parser in tcpdump has a buffer over-read vulnerability when decoding OSPFv3 packets, specifically in the `ospf6_decode_v3()` function within `print-ospf6.c`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially trigger a denial-of-service condition or possibly execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted OSPFv3 packet to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump.  The severity is rated as critical.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by network traffic. An attacker can send a malicious OSPFv3 packet to a target system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump."
