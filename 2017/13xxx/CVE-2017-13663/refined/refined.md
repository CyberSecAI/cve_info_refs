Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-13663:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The iSmartAlarm CubeOne firmware (versions 2.1.4.1 and 2.2.4.8) contains an exposed OpenSSL passphrase within the `iSmartAlarm` binary. This passphrase is used to encrypt log files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Hardcoded encryption key:** The OpenSSL passphrase used for log file encryption is embedded directly within the firmware binary. This constitutes a major security flaw since the key is not meant to be exposed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Log file decryption:** An attacker who has access to the firmware can extract the exposed passphrase and use it to decrypt log files from the iSmartAlarm CubeOne device.
- **Potential data exposure:** Decrypted logs may contain sensitive information which could lead to further compromises.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Firmware extraction:** The attacker needs to obtain the iSmartAlarm CubeOne firmware, which can be retrieved from the `/storage/emulated/0/iSmartAlarm/Firmware/` directory on an Android device used to manage the CubeOne.
- **Static analysis:** Once the firmware is obtained, the attacker can perform static analysis by using tools like `strings` to extract the encryption passphrase.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to firmware:** The attacker must obtain a copy of the iSmartAlarm CubeOne firmware.
- **Static analysis capabilities:** The attacker must be able to perform basic static analysis using tools like `strings`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides detailed steps on how the vulnerability was found, including the tools and processes used to extract the firmware and identify the hardcoded passphrase.
- The vendor, iSmartAlarm, was informed about the vulnerability and has released a firmware update to fix/mitigate this issue.
