  "cveId": "CVE-2017-13134",
  "description": "The provided documents describe a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the SFWScan function of GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick when processing a crafted SFW file.",
  "affectedProduct": "ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `SFWScan` function in `coders/sfw.c` within both ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick incorrectly handles boundary conditions when searching for a specific byte sequence in a buffer. The loop condition `(p+length) < q` allows the inner loop to access memory beyond the allocated buffer when `length` is close to the difference between pointers `q` and `p`. Specifically, the inner loop iterates `for (i=0; i < (ssize_t) length; i++)` and accesses the buffer through `p[i]`, leading to a heap buffer over-read.",
    "weaknesses": [

    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially other unspecified impacts, including information disclosure.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Specially crafted SFW image file",
