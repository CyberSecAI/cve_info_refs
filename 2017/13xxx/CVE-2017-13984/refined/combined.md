| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Application Performance Management System Health. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the SHExportToExcel servlet, which listens on TCP port 18080 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete any file accessible to the SYSTEM account. |
