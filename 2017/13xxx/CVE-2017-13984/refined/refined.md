- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the SHExportToExcel servlet before using it in file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal, arbitrary file deletion, and authentication bypass
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can delete arbitrary files on the vulnerable system. Since the application runs as SYSTEM, attackers can delete any file accessible by that account.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via the SHExportToExcel servlet, which listens on TCP port 18080 by default
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable server. Although authentication is required, the existing mechanism can be bypassed.
