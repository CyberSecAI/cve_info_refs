Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-13015:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `eap_print()` function within the `print-eap.c` file of the tcpdump source code. This function is responsible for parsing and printing Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Over-read:** The core issue is a buffer over-read vulnerability. This occurs because the `eap_print()` function does not properly validate the length of the EAP data before accessing it. This lack of bounds checking can lead to reading data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive information from the process memory.
*   **Denial of Service:** Reading beyond the buffer can also lead to crashes, resulting in denial-of-service for the affected service or application using tcpdump.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic:** The primary attack vector is through network traffic. An attacker could craft a malicious EAP packet and send it to a system running `tcpdump`. If tcpdump is used to monitor this traffic, the crafted packet could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to send network traffic to the machine running `tcpdump`

**Technical Details:**

*   The `eap_print()` function is used to interpret EAP frames
*   The vulnerability occurs when processing EAP frames of type `EAP_FRAME_TYPE_PACKET`.
*   The code extracts the EAP type and length (`len`) from the packet data but does not perform adequate bounds checks
*   Specifically, when handling different subtypes, for example `EAP_TYPE_TTLS`, the code attempts to access bits and values within the packet based on the subtype and length.
*   The code does not properly check if the packet length allows for these accesses, resulting in a possible buffer over-read if a malicious packet with invalid length fields is processed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves adding more bounds checks within the `eap_print()` function before accessing the data in the EAP packet. This prevents the code from reading beyond allocated buffers.
*   The provided content from the `tcpdump-changes.txt` file mentions the fix and addition of a test case, along with the reporter of this issue which is Bhargava Shastry.
*   Red Hat Security Advisory (RHEA-2018:0705) indicates that this CVE was addressed in a tcpdump update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, which includes a patch for `eap_print()`.

In summary, CVE-2017-13015 is a buffer over-read vulnerability in `tcpdump`'s EAP parsing logic, which can be exploited through malicious network traffic and could lead to information disclosure or denial of service. The fix involves implementing thorough bounds checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
