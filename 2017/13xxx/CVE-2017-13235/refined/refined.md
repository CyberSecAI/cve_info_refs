Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-13235:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the handling of EXTx-STREAM-INFO within the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol implementation. Specifically, the issue stems from a lack of proper validation of malformed EXTx-STREAM-INFO data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Malformed Data Handling:** The code does not sufficiently check for malformed EXTx-STREAM-INFO, allowing potentially invalid data to be processed.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** This lack of validation can lead to a denial of service when handling malformed EXTx-STREAM-INFO data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HLS stream containing malformed EXTx-STREAM-INFO data. This could cause the media framework to crash, resulting in a denial of service on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HLS Stream:** An attacker can host or inject a malicious HLS stream containing malformed EXTx-STREAM-INFO data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need the ability to serve a malicious HLS stream to the targeted device, either by hosting it themselves or by injecting it into a network stream.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided commit message indicates the fix involves adding a check for malformed EXTx-STREAM-INFO data in `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml`.
*   The vulnerability is specifically categorized as "NSI" and "DoS," meaning a non-specified impact leading to a denial-of-service.
*   The fix was applied to Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1, while devices running older versions such as 5.1.1, 6.0 and 6.0.1 are also affected but do not seem to have received an update.
