RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
