The content is related to CVE-2017-13739.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap overflow in the `resolveSubtable()` function within liblouis.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `sprintf` function is used to construct a file path without proper bounds checking, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the `tableFile` buffer is overflowed when the input strings `dir` and `table` are too long.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The heap overflow causes a crash due to a memory corruption, potentially leading to denial of service, and potentially other impacts, such as arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered using a crafted input file for `lou_checktable`, as shown by the provided "POC2" example, which causes the vulnerable `resolveSubtable` function to be invoked with overly long file path components..
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to supply a crafted table to `lou_checktable`. The attacker needs to be able to execute this tool.
