Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13023:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the IPv6 mobility parser of tcpdump, specifically in the `mobility_opt_print()` function. The code attempts to fetch data from a packet without proper bounds checking, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The code reads data beyond the allocated buffer when processing IPv6 mobility options.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:**  An attacker could cause tcpdump to crash, leading to a denial of service by providing a specially crafted packet.
*   **Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly stated, an out-of-bounds read could potentially leak sensitive information from memory, depending on the environment.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network traffic:** The vulnerability can be triggered by capturing and processing network traffic containing specially crafted IPv6 mobility options.
*   **Malformed PCAP files:** An attacker could create a malicious pcap file containing the crafted packets and provide it to the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject or provide a network packet stream to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump. This could mean the attacker is present on a network segment that the targeted tcpdump instance is monitoring, or able to provide the crafted pcap file to the target.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in tcpdump version 4.9.2.
*   The fix involves adding a bounds check before fetching data using the ND_TCHECK_16BITS macro.
*   Red Hat, Debian, and Gentoo have released security advisories addressing this vulnerability with updated tcpdump packages.
*   Apple has also addressed this vulnerability in macOS High Sierra 10.13.1, Security Update 2017-001 Sierra, and Security Update 2017-004 El Capitan.
*   The provided github commit message indicates the fix was for a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry, SecT/TU Berlin
