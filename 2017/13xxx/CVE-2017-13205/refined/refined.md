Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the processing of MPEG1 video streams where the `f_code` parameter, which determines the number of bits to read from the stream, is not properly validated. The valid range for `f_code` is [1, 7]. When a value of 0 is used, the code attempts to read a negative number of bits from the stream, leading to undefined behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of input validation:** The MPEG1 decoder does not validate the `f_code` parameter before using it.
- **Integer Underflow:** The code subtracts 1 from `f_code` without ensuring `f_code` is not 0. This results in a negative number, leading to out-of-bounds access when used as an index/bit count for stream reading.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the media processing service when attempting to read a negative number of bits from the stream.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is a malformed MPEG1 video stream containing an invalid `f_code` parameter (specifically, a value of 0).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed MPEG1 video stream to a vulnerable device. This could be through various means such as:
    - Delivering the stream via a media app.
    - Embedding the stream in a web page if the media decoder is used there.
    - Through another application that processes media.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the value of `f_code` is within the valid range [1, 7] before performing bit reads.
- This vulnerability is present in the `libmpeg2` library.
- The provided commit message states that without the check the value of `f_code` could be 0. When reading bits from the stream, `(f_code - 1)` bits are read, which is undefined if `f_code` is 0.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity, but the Pixel/Nexus security bulletin lists it as "DoS | High" in Android versions 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1
