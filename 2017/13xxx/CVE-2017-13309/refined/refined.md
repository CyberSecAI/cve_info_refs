{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A bug in the reading of encrypted data from BoringSSL resulted in data being placed at the wrong offset of the temporary buffer. This occurred when the SSLEngine was overloaded with multiple heap buffer inputs, which were then converted to direct buffers for JNI by copying them into a single temporary direct buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap buffer overflow",
    "Incorrect offset calculation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The output data was prefixed, in the worst case, by plaintext. This could lead to information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the SSLEngine receives multiple heap buffers as input.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to send specially crafted input data to the SSLEngine."
