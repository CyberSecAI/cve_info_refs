Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys within the `musical.ly` application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The application contains a hard-coded cryptographic key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain elevated access to the application and its data. The specific impact details would depend on how and where the key is used within the app. The document indicates that a worst-case scenario could result in code execution as a system user, but acknowledges that many of the vulnerabilities have lower impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the exploitation of the hard-coded cryptographic key within the application. The document mentions that some vulnerabilities could be exploited through malicious third-party apps installed by the user, but that isn't specific to this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to analyze the application and identify the hard-coded cryptographic key. This would typically involve reverse engineering of the application code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable application is `musical.ly - your video social network`, version `6.1.6`, for `iOS`
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities identified in various Android and iOS applications, mainly due to incorrect user permissions/access control, and hardcoded cryptographic keys.
