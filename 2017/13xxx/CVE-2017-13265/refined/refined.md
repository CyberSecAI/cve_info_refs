Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-13265

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of a maximum timestamp check in the `update_engine` component of the Android system. This allows for potentially malicious payloads to bypass the downgrade protection mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Maximum Timestamp Check:** The `update_engine` did not verify if the OS build timestamp in the update payload was older than the current timestamp.
- **Downgrade Vulnerability:** This lack of check allows an attacker to potentially install an older, potentially vulnerable OS version on the device, bypassing the intended update mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Although rated as moderate severity, a successful exploit allows an attacker to downgrade the OS, potentially opening the door for other known vulnerabilities in the older OS version, thus elevating their privileges and potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Security Downgrade:** The primary impact is the ability to force a device to revert to an earlier, potentially less secure version of the OS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Update Payload:** An attacker could craft a malicious update payload containing an older OS version, manipulating the timestamp.
- **Bypass Update Engine:** By supplying this crafted payload, the attacker could trick the update engine into installing the older OS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to deliver the Malicious Payload:** An attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious update payload to the targeted device.
- **Bypass User Confirmation (if applicable):** In some scenarios, the attacker might need to bypass user confirmation for the update.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves adding a new field, `max_timestamp`, to the protobuf used by the `update_engine`. The `update_engine` will now reject any payload without this field or if the OS build timestamp within the payload is newer than the `max_timestamp`, which helps prevent downgrades to older OS versions.
- The patch was implemented across multiple AOSP versions (7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1).
- The vulnerability is specifically addressed by commits  `9de91d94e8224314f856d0d3c884142ef5d71f44`, `8c3c80cbc706137fa1a3dc8784fd8108c0841b30` and `55b7e08bf5dda75be4b3468b55bd9dda94f67e64` in AOSP.
