Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2017-13685:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** SQLite incorrectly handles certain files, leading to a null pointer dereference. This occurs specifically in the `dump_callback` function when processing a `.dump` command after setting `PRAGMA empty_result_callbacks=1;`.
*   **Weakness:** The code does not properly handle the case where the callback function provided to `sqlite3_exec` may receive a NULL pointer. Specifically, the `dump_callback` function attempts to dereference a pointer (`rdx`) which can be NULL.
*   **Impact:** The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The program crashes with a segmentation fault due to a null pointer dereference, making the application unusable. This is more of a crash, not an arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by crafting a specific SQL file (e.g., crash.sql) containing the `PRAGMA empty_result_callbacks=1;` command followed by a `.dump` command.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the crafted SQL file using the vulnerable SQLite version, which could be achieved through local access or in a situation where an application allows the execution of external SQL files that can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Technical Details (from the crash log):**

*   The crash occurs in the `dump_callback` function at instruction `movq (%rdx), %r15`.
*   The register `rdx` contains a null pointer (0x0), leading to a read access violation.
*   The backtrace shows the call stack: `dump_callback` -> `sqlite3_exec` -> `run_schema_dump_query` -> `do_meta_command` -> `process_input` -> `main`.

**Affected Versions:**

*   The provided crash example uses SQLite version 3.20.0 on macOS Sierra 10.12.6.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notices indicate that this vulnerability affects Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The USN-4019-1 notice states: "It was discovered that SQLite incorrectly handled certain files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-13685](/security/CVE-2017-13685))"

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of commands (`PRAGMA empty_result_callbacks=1;` and `.dump`) in combination, which suggests an issue in the state management of the `sqlite3_exec` function, when it interacts with empty result callbacks in the context of the `.dump` meta-command.
