  "CVE-2017-13041": {
    "description": "The ICMPv6 parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-icmp6.c:icmp6_nodeinfo_print().",
    "root_cause": "A buffer over-read vulnerability exists within the `icmp6_nodeinfo_print()` function of `print-icmp6.c` due to insufficient bounds checking when processing ICMPv6 Node Information messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network traffic analysis using a vulnerable version of tcpdump, where an attacker could send a malicious ICMPv6 Node Information message."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when tcpdump attempts to parse an ICMPv6 Node Information message, which contains a DNS name. The code reads the length of the name from the first byte and then attempts to read that many bytes. Without sufficient checks, a crafted packet can specify a length value that exceeds the available buffer size, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the length value is within the bounds of the remaining packet data before reading the name."
