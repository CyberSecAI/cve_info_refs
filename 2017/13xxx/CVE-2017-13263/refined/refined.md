  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2017-13263",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the Overlay Manager Service (OMS) records details about overlays. The code was updated to use flags instead of boolean traits, which were wasteful to encode.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper encoding of boolean traits leading to inefficient storage/processing of overlay details by OMS."
      ],
       "impact": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP). Although it's marked as moderate severity, the original description is vague on the specifics of privilege escalation, but it does indicate a security risk.",
      "attack_vectors": "Unspecified but potentially involves manipulating overlay configurations leading to privilege escalation.",
      "required_capabilities": "Requires some form of system-level access to interact with the Overlay Manager Service or manipulate overlay configurations. Details of the needed access are not specified."
