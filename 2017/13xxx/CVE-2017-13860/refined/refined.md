The provided content includes details for CVE-2017-13860.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An encryption issue existed with S/MIME credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of S/MIME credentials during the mail draft process.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a privileged network position may be able to intercept mail. This indicates a potential man-in-the-middle attack vector where the attacker could read mail drafts that should have been encrypted.

**Attack vectors:** A privileged network position is needed, suggesting a network-based attack vector (e.g., man-in-the-middle attack on the network).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position. This implies the attacker needs to be on the network path between the sender and the mail server.

The vulnerability is present in both macOS and iOS.
