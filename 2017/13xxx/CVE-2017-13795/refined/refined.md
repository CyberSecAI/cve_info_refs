Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-13795:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue located in the `WebCore::AXObjectCache::performDeferredCacheUpdate` function within WebKit.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free (UAF): The vulnerability occurs because a memory location is freed but still accessed later.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The provided proof of concept (PoC) crashes the application due to the use-after-free, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing malicious web content: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious HTML/JavaScript content and enticing a user to open it via a browser, application, or other WebKit component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted web content to a vulnerable application utilizing WebKit. No specific user interaction is needed beyond loading the page.
- Accessibility features need to be enabled to trigger this bug.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page with specific styles and attributes in the HTML that triggers the UAF.

**Affected products:**
The vulnerability affected multiple products that used WebKit:
- iTunes 12.7.1 for Windows
- iOS 11.1
- iCloud for Windows 7.1
- Safari 11.0.1
- tvOS 11.1
- WebKitGTK+

**Additional details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit-db entry includes a functional proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML file that triggers the vulnerability, and it provides an Address Sanitizer (ASan) log, useful for understanding the vulnerability's technical details.
- The exploit-db entry states that the vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `aria-labeledby` attribute, which is associated with accessibility features.
- The ASan log pinpoints the exact location of the UAF in the `WTF::ListHashSetConstIterator` which occurs during the deferred cache update of an accessibility object.
