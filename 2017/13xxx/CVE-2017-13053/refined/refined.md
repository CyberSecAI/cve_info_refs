Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2017-13053:

**1. CVE-2017-13053 Details**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `decode_rt_routing_info()` function within the BGP parser of tcpdump. This function doesn't properly check bounds before fetching the origin AS field and the route target field. It also reuses a buffer for multiple operations which causes the results of snprintf to not be what was originally intended.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Buffer Over-read:** Reading beyond the allocated buffer when parsing the origin AS field.
    *   **Incorrect offset** Fetching the route target field from an incorrect offset.
    *   **Reused Buffer:** Using the same temporary buffer for multiple operations leading to incorrect formatting
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service (by crashing tcpdump) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code by exploiting the buffer over-read.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when tcpdump processes a specially crafted BGP packet containing route target routing information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to send a malicious BGP packet to a system running tcpdump. This likely means an attacker would have some level of network access.
    *   No specific user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**2. Technical Details from tcpdump Commit bd4e697**

*   The commit message highlights that the `decode_rt_routing_info()` function had multiple issues:
    *   It didn't check bounds before fetching the 4-octet origin AS field, leading to a potential over-read of the input buffer.
    *   It fetched the route target field from 4 octets below the correct offset.
    *   It used the same temporary buffer for `as_printf()` and `bgp_vpn_rd_print()`, causing the final `snprintf()` result to be incorrect.
*   The commit includes a fix for these issues.
*   It also includes a test using a supplied capture file to verify the fix.
*   The code diff shows the following:
    *   Bounds checking is added with `ND_TCHECK_32BITS` and `ND_TCHECK2`.
    *   The offset for accessing route target information is corrected from pptr[1] to pptr[5].
    *   The `asbuf` buffer is used only for the origin AS field, avoiding overwriting issues.
*   A new test case `bgp_vpn_rt-oobr` is introduced, including a pcap file.

**3. Red Hat Errata RHEA-2018:0705**

*   This errata mentions CVE-2017-13053 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the updated `tcpdump` package.
*   The affected products include Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, among others.
*   The advisory indicates that the `tcpdump` utility is used for monitoring network traffic by capturing and displaying packet headers.

**4. GitHub Advisory GHSA-rhhw-4wr6-whxc**

*   This advisory lists the vulnerability as a "buffer over-read" in the BGP parser of `tcpdump` before version 4.9.2.
*   It classifies the severity as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 9.8.
*   It lists the attack vector as "Network", complexity as "Low", privileges required as "None", and no user interaction.
*   It also provides a link to the commit that fixes the issue.
*   It links to the NVD page for this CVE as well.

**5. Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 201709-23**

*   This advisory lists CVE-2017-13053 as one of several vulnerabilities addressed in `tcpdump`.
*   It notes that affected versions are `< 4.9.2`.
*   It mentions that a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service.

**6. Apple Security Update HT208221**

*   This document lists CVE-2017-13053 under the tcpdump section and specifies that upgrading to version 4.9.2 fixes the issue.

*   The `CHANGES` file confirms the vulnerability is fixed in version `4.9.2` and provides a summary for the release which fixed the buffer overflow/overread vulnerabilities.

**In Summary**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2017-13053 is a buffer over-read vulnerability in `tcpdump`'s BGP parser.  The root cause is a lack of bounds checking and incorrect buffer usage when processing BGP route target routing information. This allows for a remote attacker to potentially cause a denial of service or execute code. The vulnerability was addressed in `tcpdump` version 4.9.2 and patched by several vendors including Red Hat, Gentoo, Debian, and Apple.
