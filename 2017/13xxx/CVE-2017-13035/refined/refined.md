Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-13035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the `isis_print_id()` function within the `print-isoclns.c` file of `tcpdump`. This function is responsible for printing IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Over-read:** The function doesn't properly handle IS-IS IDs that are shorter than the expected system ID length (6 octets). It reads beyond the bounds of the provided ID buffer when processing variable-length fields within IS-IS packets.
*   **Improper bounds check:** The code attempts to iterate through each octet of the system ID and print it using snprintf. It computes a system ID length (`sysid_len`), but then still loops through the fixed `SYSTEM_ID_LEN` number of bytes, using sysid_len as a temporary variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read data from memory beyond the intended IS-IS ID buffer, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Denial of Service:**  While not explicitly stated, a buffer over-read vulnerability could, in some scenarios, potentially lead to a crash (denial of service) of the application if the read operation caused a fault.
*   **Possible Remote Code Execution:** While the provided texts do not clearly state remote code execution in relation to this particular vulnerability, it cannot be fully excluded as an impact, due to a remote attacker being able to trigger the vulnerability with a malicious packet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic Analysis:** The vulnerability can be exploited by capturing and analyzing network traffic that contains specially crafted IS-IS packets.
*   **Remote Attack:** This can be triggered remotely by sending malicious IS-IS packets to a vulnerable system.
*   **Local attack (potentially):** If a user processes a pcap file which contains a malformed IS-IS packet, they may be affected by the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to capture or inject network traffic with crafted IS-IS packets.
*   **Knowledge of IS-IS:** The attacker needs to understand the IS-IS protocol and how to craft packets with malformed IS-IS IDs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved adding a check to ensure the code doesn't attempt to read beyond the bounds of the ID in `isis_print_id()`.
*   A test case was added to confirm the fix using a crafted capture file.

**Summary**

The CVE-2017-13035 vulnerability in `tcpdump` is a buffer over-read in the IS-IS ID printing function. This could allow attackers to cause a denial of service or disclose sensitive information. The vulnerability is triggered by receiving crafted IS-IS packets. The fix involves ensuring that the code only reads within the bounds of the IS-IS ID buffer, which was done in version 4.9.2.
