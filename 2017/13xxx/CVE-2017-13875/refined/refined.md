Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-13875

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `AppleIntelCapriController::GetLinkConfig` function within the Intel Graphics Driver.
- The function trusts a user-supplied value from the input structure, using it to index into a table of pointers. This is done without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The lack of bounds checking allows for an out-of-bounds read from the pointer table.
- **Code Execution:**  The out-of-bounds read pointer is subsequently passed to `AppleIntelFramebuffer::validateDisplayMode`. This function reads a pointer to a C++ object from the out-of-bounds memory location and attempts to call a virtual method, leading to arbitrary kernel code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Kernel Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel, effectively giving them complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `GetLinkConfig` method on the `IntelFBClientControl` service via the IOKit API.
-  A malicious application can supply a crafted input structure with a specific index value that will cause the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with IOKit API to open a connection to `IntelFBClientControl` service and send the crafted input.
-  The attacker must have local user privileges to be able to interact with IOKit.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit was tested on macOS 10.13 (17A365) on a MacBookAir5,2.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The exploit provided shows how a crafted input can trigger the vulnerability and achieve code execution.
