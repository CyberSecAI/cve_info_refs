{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of MPEG2 elementary stream access units. The code was searching for the start of the next access unit after the prefix instead of after the start byte.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect parsing logic in handling MPEG2 elementary stream access units"
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application could potentially exploit this vulnerability to bypass user interaction requirements and gain access to additional permissions, leading to elevation of privilege.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A local malicious application"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "A local malicious application is needed to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by correcting the parsing logic to search for the next access unit after the start byte, not the prefix."
