Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `GetInvInt()` function in the `aac` library. Malicious content could cause the function to access memory outside of the bounds of the `invCount` array. Specifically, it lacks proper bounds checking when accessing array indices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. The function doesn't validate the index before accessing memory. This can lead to reading arbitrary memory locations outside the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker may be able to read memory they shouldn't have access to, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Denial of service**: An out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash, which can result in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Media Content:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing malicious media content that is decoded by the "stagefright" media framework using the `aac` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted media file that will be processed by the vulnerable code. This could be done through various methods such as through a malicious app, malicious website, or any other means to get the media file processed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves always bounding the access to the `invCount` array to validate indices, suggesting a simple bounds check was missing.
- The provided content also has a reference to a bug (65025048) which is linked to this CVE.
- The fix for this vulnerability was cherry-picked from a prior commit indicating this vulnerability was discovered after the initial code was released.
- A test case exists for malicious content.
