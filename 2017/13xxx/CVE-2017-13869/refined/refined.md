Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13869:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of initialization in the `munge_user64_rusage` function within the kernel. This function converts a `struct rusage` to a `struct user64_rusage` for 64-bit processes when the `getrusage` syscall is called. The `struct user64_rusage` contains padding bytes after `tv_usec` elements that are not initialized but are copied to userspace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Memory Leak:** The uninitialized padding within `struct user64_rusage` can leak stack memory, potentially revealing kernel pointers and other data from previous syscalls.
- **Potential Kernel Heap Leak:** If stack freelists are empty, a new kernel stack is allocated without zeroing it. This allows the new stack to potentially contain data from previous heap allocations, enabling heap memory leakage.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core issue lies in the function not sanitizing memory by not initializing padding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from kernel memory, which could include kernel pointers or other data from heap.
- **Denial of Service:** While not explicitly stated, repeated memory access from the leaked information may cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **System Call:** The attacker needs to call the `getrusage` syscall.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to execute code on the target system as a local user.
- They need to be able to make system calls.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**

- The Exploit-DB entry provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code snippet from the kernel.
- It shows how the `getrusage` system call is used to trigger the vulnerability.
- It also provides a proof-of-concept code example demonstrating how the padding leaks stack and potentially heap memory.
- The advisory/source link points to the Google Project Zero issue tracker, further solidifying the information.

In summary, CVE-2017-13869 is a kernel information disclosure vulnerability caused by uninitialized padding during the conversion of `struct rusage` to `struct user64_rusage`. This allows a local attacker to leak stack and potentially heap memory, which could be used for further exploitation.
