  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2017-13208",
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is related to a check on DHCP response packet length in libnetutils.",
      "Weaknesses": "Improper validation of the DHCP response packet length",
      "Impact": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability using a specially crafted DHCP response packet.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted DHCP response packet to the vulnerable device. This typically involves being on the same network as the target device or being able to intercept network traffic.",
       "More_details": "The provided commit message indicates 'libnetutils: Check dhcp response packet length'. This suggests that the vulnerability lies in how the system handles and processes DHCP response packets, specifically related to their length. An incorrect length check could lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues which could lead to RCE."
