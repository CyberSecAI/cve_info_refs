Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-13664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The iSmartAlarm CubeOne firmware, specifically versions 2.1.4.1 and 2.2.4.8, contains an exposed password file within the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Password File Exposure:** The `/etc/passwd` file, which contains user account information (including usernames and password hashes or placeholders), is directly accessible within the firmware's file system. The corresponding shadow file is missing, indicating that the password hashes are stored directly within `/etc/passwd`, which is not ideal.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The firmware does not have proper access controls that would prevent unauthorized access to the password file when emulated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers who gain access to the password file can obtain credentials that could allow them to execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges on the device.
*   **Full Control of Device:** With administrative access, attackers can potentially take full control of the iSmartAlarm CubeOne device, potentially disrupting its intended functionality and compromising the security of the connected smart home ecosystem.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Firmware Analysis:** Attackers can obtain the firmware, likely through similar means described in the content (e.g. retrieving from the associated mobile application).
*   **Firmware Emulation:** By emulating the firmware using tools like FIRMADYNE, and FAT, an attacker can access the file system.
*   **File System Access:** Once the firmware is emulated, the attacker can navigate to `/etc/passwd` and access the exposed credentials within the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Expertise:** Attackers need to be familiar with firmware analysis, reverse engineering, and Linux-based systems.
*   **Access to Firmware:** The attacker would need access to the iSmartAlarm CubeOne firmware file. This can be done by intercepting a firmware update or extracting the firmware from the mobile app as described in the provided content.
*   **Emulation Setup:** The attacker needs the ability to set up a firmware emulation environment, including using tools like FIRMADYNE and FAT.
