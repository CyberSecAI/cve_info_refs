  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2017-13151",
      "description": "The vulnerability lies in the `libmpeg2` library, specifically related to how `num_mbs_left` is handled when mb_x is reset. When mb_x is reset, num_mbs_left should also be reset accordingly. Additionally, the code didn't handle the case where first_mb was set to 1, so code was added to set the mb_x value and update `num_mbs_left` similar to `impge2d_dec_pnb_mb_params` function.",
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of `num_mbs_left` when `mb_x` is reset and incorrect handling when `first_mb` is set to 1",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Incorrect calculation and handling of `num_mbs_left` during macroblock processing in MPEG2 decoding."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE). A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process by exploiting a specially crafted file.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file that uses the vulnerable MPEG2 decoding process."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted MPEG2 file to the vulnerable device for decoding."

      "description": "This entry is related to a fix for an overflow in SEI timing parameters, it is not related to the mpeg2 vulnerability",
      "root_cause": "Overflow in SEI timing parameters.",

        "Overflow in SEI timing parameters during processing."

      "impact": "Likely remote code execution or denial of service, given the context.",

        "The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted video stream containing malicious SEI timing parameters."
