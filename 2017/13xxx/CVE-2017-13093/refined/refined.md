- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The P1735 IEEE standard for encrypting electronic design intellectual property (IP) has flaws that allow for modification of encrypted IP ciphertext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Modification of encrypted IP ciphertext to insert hardware Trojans.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Insertion of hardware Trojans into encrypted IP without the knowledge of the IP owner.
    - Resulting in integrated circuits (ICs) with backdoors, poor performance, or complete failure.
    - Potential loss of profit and reputation for IP owners.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Modification of the encrypted IP ciphertext.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs the ability to modify the ciphertext of the encrypted IP.
