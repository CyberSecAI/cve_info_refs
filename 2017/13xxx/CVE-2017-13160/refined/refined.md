{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `bta_gattc_cache_load` function attempts to read 0xFF attributes into an allocation sized by `num_attr`, which can be smaller than 0xFF. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
    "attack_vectors": "A proximate attacker can exploit this vulnerability through the Bluetooth interface.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within proximity to the vulnerable device and capable of interacting via Bluetooth. No specific user interaction is mentioned. "
