Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13233:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `libhevc` library, specifically related to how it handles "ctb pu map" for "I slice".  It involves an issue where the library might not properly validate that the width and height of a coding block (CB) are multiples of a minimum CB size, which can result in an out of bounds read or write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a denial-of-service. Specifically, due to the issue with 'ctb pu map' processing for I slices, a crafted input could cause a crash by attempting to access invalid memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial of service due to a crash within the media framework. This could lead to the affected application becoming unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted media file that exploits the flaw in how the `libhevc` library handles  "ctb pu map" for I slices. 
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker who can provide the malicious file to be processed by the media framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide a Crafted File:** An attacker must be able to get the target device to process a specially crafted media file.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker doesn't require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Android Security Bulletin indicates a "High" severity rating for this issue.
- The vulnerability is present in Android versions 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1, and the fix is included in the 2018-02-01 security patch level.
- The fix was made in AOSP with the following commit [A-62851602](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libhevc/%2B/a22314db4e0cfe11ef3e50dac6a13d52f7a595b3).
- There's also an additional commit [A-65483665](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libhevc/%2B/68e532d83a1b98f6b5e297d71b547ed93a68dfe3) which is related to a similar issue where the width and height of the coding block were not being checked to be multiples of the minimum block size. This was categorized as DoS with High severity.

In summary, CVE-2017-13233 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Android media framework that arises from improper handling of crafted media files due to how the `libhevc` library handles ctb pu map for I slices, leading to a crash if width and height of a coding block are not multiples of minimum block size.
