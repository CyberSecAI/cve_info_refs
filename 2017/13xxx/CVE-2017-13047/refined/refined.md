{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect bounds check in the `esis_print` function within the ISO ES-IS parser. The check was performed on one pointer, while the loop incremented a different pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A buffer over-read can lead to a denial of service and potentially information disclosure.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network traffic"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted ISO ES-IS packet.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by correcting the bounds check in the esis_print() function to properly check the pointer that is being incremented in the loop. Additionally, the function was updated to print a standard marker when truncated data is detected."
