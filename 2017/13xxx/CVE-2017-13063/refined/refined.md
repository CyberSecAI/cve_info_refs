Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13063:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions `CVE-2017-13063` in multiple sources:

*   The GraphicsMagick changelog entry explicitly mentions "Fix SourceForge bugs 434 'heap buffer overflow in GetStyleTokens'", which, along with other bug fixes, are related to this CVE, and is also mentioned in the Debian Security Advisory DSA-4321-1
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice USN-4222-1 lists `CVE-2017-13063` as one of the fixed vulnerabilities.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla entries related to GraphicsMagick also mention `CVE-2017-13063`

This confirms the content is related to CVE-2017-13063

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `GetStyleTokens()` function within the `coders/svg.c` file of GraphicsMagick.  This overflow is caused by insufficient bounds checking when parsing style attributes in SVG files. Specifically, the code calculates the number of tokens in the style string and allocates memory accordingly, but it does not handle cases where the string is malformed (e.g., a very long string) that causes an overflow. There is also inconsistent initialization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `GetStyleTokens()` function does not properly validate or sanitize the input string before parsing it into tokens. Specifically, the code did not properly truncate parsing when encountering poorly-formed input.
    *   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The code uses `MagickAllocateMemory` to allocate memory to store the tokens, and the size is calculated based on the number of ":" characters. However, the code does not handle cases where the actual number of tokens is greater than the memory allocated, which can cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
    *   **Inconsistent Initialization:** The code wasn't properly initializing the allocated token array using `memset`, leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could craft a malicious SVG file that, when processed by GraphicsMagick, would trigger the buffer overflow, potentially crashing the application.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, a heap buffer overflow can sometimes be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted and the attacker can control the overflow data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious SVG files:**  An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted SVG file as input to a program that uses GraphicsMagick.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to supply a malformed or oversized SVG file to an application that uses the vulnerable GraphicsMagick library.

**3. Additional Details from the Patches:**

*   The fix in `coders/svg.c` modifies the `GetStyleTokens` function to:
    *   Calculate the required buffer size more accurately based on the style string.
    *   Initialize the token array using `memset`
    *   Truncate parsing of style string for poorly-formed input to avoid overflows, while parsing well formed input.
    *   Properly free the allocated memory when an allocation fails.

**4. Summary**

The vulnerability in `GetStyleTokens()` allows a malicious actor to cause a denial of service and possibly achieve arbitrary code execution via a heap-based buffer overflow. This can be achieved by providing a specially crafted SVG file that has a malformed style attribute. The patch truncates the parsing when malformed data is encountered and avoids the buffer overflow by doing so.
