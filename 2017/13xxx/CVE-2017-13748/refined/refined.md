Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-13748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory leak within the Jasper library's image decoding process. Specifically, when image decoding fails, the library does not properly release the memory that was allocated to store tile data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak, which can lead to resource exhaustion if an attacker repeatedly triggers the failure condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By repeatedly providing malformed image files that trigger the decoding failure and subsequent memory leak, an attacker can exhaust available memory resources, leading to application instability or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a malformed or specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file to an application that utilizes the vulnerable JasPer library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide input to an application using the vulnerable Jasper library. This could be achieved in various ways, such as:
    - Uploading a malicious image file to a web server.
    - Embedding the crafted image within a document that is processed by a vulnerable application.
    - Sending the image to a service via any communication protocol.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in JasPer versions prior to the fix.
-  The issue is described as a tile memory not being released when image parsing fails
- Some reports indicate that the `jas_strdup()` function is not the root cause but rather the symptom of the issue.
- A fix was proposed in a github pull request https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/pull/159
