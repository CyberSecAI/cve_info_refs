Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how the Android Hardware Service Manager (hwservicemanager) registers services. Specifically, it incorrectly uses the PID (Process ID) of the calling process to perform access control checks. This approach is flawed because:

1.  The service being registered might be hosted in a different process than the one making the binder call.
2.  The calling process's PID is not a reliable identifier, as the process can transition to a zombie or dead state, and another process can take its place with the same PID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PID Reuse/Race Condition:** The hardware service manager uses the calling process's PID to determine the SELinux context for access control. An attacker can exploit this by creating a race condition where the calling process dies, and a privileged process takes its PID. The service manager would then incorrectly use the privileged context for the access control check, allowing the attacker to register a malicious service.
*   **getpidcon() vulnerability:** The `getpidcon()` function is called with the captured PID to get the security context, leading to the bypass of SELinux restrictions.
*   **Service Hijacking**: Due to the flaw in access control, a malicious actor can register a service in the hardware service manager using an elevated security context, therefore replacing the original service with one under their control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Service Replacement:** An attacker can replace any service published by system_server, including critical services like "IBase", "ISchedulingPolicyService", and "ISensorManager."
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By replacing system services, an attacker can gain elevated privileges, allowing them to perform actions they normally would not be authorized to do.
*   **System Instability**: By registering malicious services critical to the system, an attacker may cause the system to malfunction.
*   **Code execution:** By injecting malicious services, the attacker can cause code to be run on the device with the security context of the replaced service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Binder Transactions:** The vulnerability is triggered through the "add" binder call to the hardware service manager, specifically the `ServiceManager::add` function.
*   **Token Manager:** An attacker can use the "Token Manager" service to pass binder objects between processes, making the exploitation easier.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Processes:** An attacker needs to be able to create and manage processes on the Android system.
*   **Access to Hardware Binder:** The attacker must have access to the hwbinder device and the token service.
*   **Timing Control:** The attacker needs to control the timing of process creation and termination to manipulate the PID usage.
*   **No special permissions**: The exploit does not require any special permissions, and it can be exploited by unprivileged applications.
*   **Knowledge of the Service Manager**: A working knowledge of Android's hardware service manager is needed to perform the exploitation successfully.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a detailed attack flow to achieve deterministic exploitation with no race condition, using a combination of process forking, PID reuse, and binder calls.
*   The `getpidcon(0)` issue mentioned as a secondary vulnerability in the exploit-db content, which is related to using `oneway` binder transactions is no longer present because the libselinux library was updated.
*   The hardware service manager uses the process ID in other calls as well, therefore the same exploitation logic may be used to exploit these commands but with a slightly higher difficulty due to the lack of binder call prior to the access control check.
