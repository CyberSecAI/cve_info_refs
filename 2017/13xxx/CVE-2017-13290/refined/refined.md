Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13290:

**CVE-2017-13290**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the Bluetooth component (`system/bt`) of Android. Specifically, there is an issue with how the system handles `p_req`, potentially leading to an information disclosure vulnerability. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that `p_req_end` is verified before reading from `p_req`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information Disclosure due to improper handling of `p_req` in Bluetooth. The system reads from `p_req` without first validating `p_req_end`.

*  **Impact of Exploitation**: This could potentially lead to information disclosure, meaning a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves connecting a crafted headset via Bluetooth which triggers the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be in Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device and have a crafted headset that can interact with the Bluetooth stack in such a way as to trigger the vulnerability.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The fix for CVE-2017-13290 is described in the commit message as: "SDP: Check p_req_end before reading from p_req". This indicates that the vulnerability is related to the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) within the Bluetooth stack, where a read operation on `p_req` was performed without first validating if the end of request (`p_req_end`) was reached or not, potentially causing an information disclosure issue. The fix makes sure that `p_req_end` is validated to avoid reading out of bounds of a Bluetooth request
