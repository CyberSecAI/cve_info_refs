Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13283:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Bluetooth component of the Android system. Specifically, it involves how the system handles text attribute values in responses. The commit messages reference "Check number of text attribute values in response," indicating that the issue is related to improper validation of the number of text attributes in a Bluetooth response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system does not properly check the number of text attribute values in a response. This lack of validation allows for the possibility of providing a crafted Bluetooth response containing an unexpected number of attributes, leading to an exploitable condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" and enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This could allow the attacker to gain full control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Bluetooth Response:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Bluetooth response containing manipulated text attribute values to a vulnerable Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device to send the malicious response.
- **Bluetooth Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Bluetooth interface of the target device to send the crafted response.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is patched with the 2018-04-01 security patch level.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1.
