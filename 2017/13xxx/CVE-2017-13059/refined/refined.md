Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13059:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content from `usn.ubuntu.com` and `security.gentoo.org` explicitly mentions CVE-2017-13059 as a vulnerability fixed in ImageMagick. The github content also mentions a memory leak in `WriteJNGImage` which is related to the vulnerability, as that is the vulnerable function.
   - The CVE description is PLACEHOLDER, so no further checks can be made.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of malformed image files within ImageMagick.
   - Specifically, a memory leak was found in the `WriteJNGImage` function within the `coders/png.c` file.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - Improper input validation/handling of image files.
    - Memory leak in the `WriteJNGImage` function, leading to resource exhaustion.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause a DoS by repeatedly triggering the memory leak, leading to resource exhaustion and program crashes.
   - **Possible Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, the Ubuntu notice mentions "possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program," suggesting a potential for more severe exploitation beyond DoS. The Gentoo advisory mentions "unspecified impacts."
   - **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The Gentoo advisory also mentions that attackers could obtain sensitive information.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - An attacker needs to entice a user or automated system to process a specially crafted image file. This could be achieved through various means like:
     - Embedding a malicious image in a website or email.
     - Tricking a user into opening the image directly using ImageMagick.
     - Sending a malicious file to a system that uses ImageMagick for image processing

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to create a specially crafted, malformed image file designed to trigger the vulnerability.
   - They need a method to deliver the malformed image to a system running a vulnerable version of ImageMagick (e.g., via email, web server, file sharing)
   - The attack is considered remote.

**Additional Details:**
  - The GitHub issue `#667` provides a specific code snippet showing the memory leak with the function and source file mentioned. It also links a test case file.

**Summary of extracted information:**
- **Root cause:** Incorrect handling of malformed image files, specifically a memory leak in `WriteJNGImage`.
- **Weakness:** Memory leak and improper input validation.
- **Impact:** Denial of service, potential code execution, and possibly sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vector:** Enticing a user to process a crafted image file.
- **Attacker capabilities:** Create a malformed image and deliver it to the victim.
