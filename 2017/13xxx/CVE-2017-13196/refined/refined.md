Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13196:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `libhevc` library, which is related to HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) video processing.
- The specific cause is an incomplete frame error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
- An incomplete frame error can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could exploit this by sending a specially crafted HEVC file to a vulnerable device.
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, potentially disrupting media playback or causing the application using the library to terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack vector.
- The attacker would need to provide a specially crafted HEVC video file that triggers the incomplete frame error during processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send or make the vulnerable device process a malicious HEVC file.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided source code link associated with the CVE [A-63522067](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libhevc/%2B/f5b2fa243b4c45a4cd885e85f49ae548ab88c264) appears to be the fix for this issue. This is actually the same link for CVE-2017-13191, suggesting this may be a duplicate CVE or a fix addressing multiple vulnerabilities in the same codebase.
