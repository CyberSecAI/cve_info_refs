Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted image file, specifically in the MAT (MATLAB) image coder of ImageMagick.
- The issue arises from a failure to properly handle error conditions within the `ReadMATImage` function, specifically when the file header does not match the expected "MATLAB" identifier. This leads to an assertion failure in `DestroyImageInfo`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Assertion Failure:** The primary vulnerability is an assertion failure within the `DestroyImageInfo` function. This function is called to free memory associated with image information. When the assertion fails, the program aborts, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Memory Handling Issues:** The code exhibits problems related to memory management, specifically in how `ImageInfo` structures are destroyed. When an error occurs during image reading, the code may attempt to free an invalid memory address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is a denial-of-service (DoS). When a crafted MAT file is processed by ImageMagick, the program crashes due to the assertion failure, disrupting service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted MAT image file. An attacker would need to provide this malicious image to a system or application using ImageMagick for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image file to a system running a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This could be achieved through a web application that processes user-uploaded images, a service that processes images from a network, or through other file-processing mechanisms. No special privileges are required, just the ability to supply the malicious file.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided GitHub commit ([https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/e5c063a1007506ba69e97a35effcdef944421c89](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/e5c063a1007506ba69e97a35effcdef944421c89)) shows the fix for this issue. It involves adding a check to ensure that `clone_info` is not NULL before attempting to destroy it, preventing the assertion failure and memory corruption.
