  "CVE-2017-13190": {
    "description": "The provided text indicates that a fix was made to gracefully handle memory allocation failures for the `ps_codec_obj` object in the `libhevc` library.  Specifically, if memory allocation for `ps_codec_obj` fails, the code should return an error code. All other allocation failures are handled correctly.",
    "root_cause": "Memory allocation failure in libhevc when creating a `ps_codec_obj` object.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of service due to unhandled memory allocation failure potentially leading to a crash. (Indicated as High severity DoS in the bulletin)"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial-of-service vulnerability that could potentially crash the process attempting to allocate memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability could be triggered by a specially crafted media file or stream that causes the allocation of `ps_codec_obj` to fail.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to cause the device to process a malicious media file or stream. This can be achieved through various means such as malicious websites, apps, or file transfers. The attacker does not need any privileges."
