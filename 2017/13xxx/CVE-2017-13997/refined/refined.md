- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication for critical function. The HMI client can trigger script execution on the server without proper authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306), which allows a remote attacker to bypass server authentication and trigger the execution of arbitrary commands with high privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands with high privileges, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, with low skill level needed to exploit. An attacker can send commands over the network to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability, only network access to the vulnerable server.
