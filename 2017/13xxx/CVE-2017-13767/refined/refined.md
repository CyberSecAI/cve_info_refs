Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The MSDP dissector in Wireshark can enter an infinite loop due to a malformed Notification TLV (Type-Length-Value).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed Notification TLVs within the MSDP dissector.
- Lack of proper bounds checking or error handling when processing MSDP packets.
- The vulnerability exists within the dissection engine (libwireshark).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is excessive CPU resource consumption on the system running Wireshark.
- This can lead to denial-of-service conditions, making Wireshark unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injecting a malformed MSDP packet onto the network.
- Convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file (pcap) containing the malformed MSDP packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic or provide a capture file to a user running a vulnerable version of Wireshark.
- No specific authentication or elevated privileges are required for the attacker.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Wireshark (2.4.0, 2.2.0 to 2.2.8, 2.0.0 to 2.0.14).
- A sample capture file ("hang.pcap") demonstrating the vulnerability is available.
- The fix is included in Wireshark versions 2.4.1, 2.2.9, and 2.0.15, and later versions.
