    "description": "It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overread vulnerability existed in the keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overread"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": [
      "Local access to the system"
    ],
    "details": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of valid_master_desc() in which a memory buffer would be compared to a userspace value with an incorrect size of comparison. By bruteforcing the comparison, an attacker could determine what was in memory after the description and possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory."
