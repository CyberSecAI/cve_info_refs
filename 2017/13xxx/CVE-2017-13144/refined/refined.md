Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13144:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered in ImageMagick when processing image files with excessively large dimensions. Specifically, when the image dimensions exceed the configured limits, a crash occurs instead of a "width or height exceeds limit" error message. This was demonstrated using the MPC (Magick Pixel Cache) coder, which is used for reading and writing image pixel data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation**: ImageMagick fails to properly check the image dimensions before processing, resulting in a crash instead of graceful error handling.
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Instead of producing a specific error message indicating exceeded limits, a generic memory allocation failure occurs, which does not provide enough information to diagnose the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause a crash in the ImageMagick application by providing a specially crafted image file with dimensions that exceed the configured limits leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image File**: The primary attack vector is via a crafted image file with dimensions exceeding the processing limit set within ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted image to a system using ImageMagick. This could be accomplished by:
   - Tricking a user into opening the image through a web browser, email or other means.
   - Providing a malformed image to a service or application that utilizes ImageMagick to process image data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a crash in the MPC coder.
- Command-line `-limit` parameters for width and height are not effective to bypass the policy limits defined in `policy.xml`. These parameters can only be used to tighten the limits, not relax them.
- The fix includes a patch that produces a more informative error message when dimensions exceed the limit, in addition to the memory error.

The provided information from various sources including Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu and the ImageMagick forums all corroborate that the root cause was due to the lack of proper input sanitization of image dimensions when using the mpc coder, leading to a crash instead of a more user friendly error.
