Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13733:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an illegal address access within the `fmt_entry` function of the `dump_entry.c` file in the ncurses library. This occurs when the code attempts to use `strcmp` on a string that is a `CANCELLED_STRING` which is defined as `(char *)(-1)`, which leads to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Handling of Special String Values:** The ncurses library failed to properly check for `CANCELLED_STRING` before passing it to the `strcmp` function. `strcmp` is designed to work with valid memory addresses and accessing memory at `(char *)(-1)` will cause a segmentation fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed terminfo Data:** A remote attacker could trigger the vulnerability by crafting malicious terminfo data. When this data is processed by `infotocap` or other utilities utilizing ncurses' terminfo parsing capabilities, the vulnerability can be triggered.
- The `infotocap` utility was used to trigger the crash during the vulnerability discovery.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious terminfo file or manipulate data processed by a ncurses application.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to process the malformed terminfo data.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within `fmt_entry` function at line 996 in `dump_entry.c` where `strcmp` is called.
- A patch was implemented in ncurses to properly check for `CANCELLED_STRING` before calling `strcmp`, using the macro `VALID_STRING`. This patch fixed the vulnerability by ensuring only valid strings, that are neither `ABSENT_STRING` (char*)0, nor `CANCELLED_STRING` (char *)(-1), are passed to `strcmp`.
- The issue was initially reported against ncurses version 6.0, and was fixed in a later version. The Gentoo security advisory indicates that versions prior to 6.1 are affected.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that this bug was resolved as a duplicate of bug 1488920.

This analysis provides more detail than the standard CVE description, as it includes specifics about the vulnerable function, the type of invalid string, and the fix that was implemented.
