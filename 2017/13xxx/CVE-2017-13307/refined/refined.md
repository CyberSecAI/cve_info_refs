Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13307:

**CVE-2017-13307**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks in the `pci sysfs` component within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue lies in how PCI devices and their configurations are exposed through the sysfs interface. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to write to specific attributes related to PCI devices, even if they lack the necessary privileges.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper privilege checks when writing to PCI device attributes via `sysfs`. This allows for unauthorized modification of PCI device configurations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges (EoP). By writing to specific PCI attributes, they could potentially alter the behavior of PCI devices, leading to system instability, denial of service, or other malicious outcomes. The specific impact is not detailed, but the potential for privilege escalation and control over hardware devices is significant.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Local exploitation via the `sysfs` interface. An attacker would need local access to the system to interact with the filesystem and write to the specific vulnerable attributes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability. This is typical for privilege escalation flaws, where an attacker with low privileges tries to gain higher privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Android Security Bulletin indicates this vulnerability was addressed in the 2018-04-05 security patch level for Google devices.
*   The upstream kernel commit mentioned in the description does not seem to exist, the provided link leads to a commit that address a different vulnerability (CVE-2017-17449).
*   The patch for CVE-2017-17449 mentioned on lkml.org shows a fix for the netlink interface. The patch filters traffic so that nlmon (netlink monitor) in a child namespace can only sniff netlink messages from its own netns (network namespace), which could be related to the issue described in CVE-2017-13307, but it is not related to `pci sysfs`.
