Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13157:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
The provided commit log and security bulletin directly mention `CVE-2017-13157` and its corresponding bug ID `A-32990341`. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
The vulnerability stems from an improper handling of URI permissions related to `KEY_INTENT`. Specifically, `KEY_INTENT` was incorrectly granting URI permissions. Malicious applications could potentially exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized access to resources. Furthermore, a general-purpose security check allowed `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE` to bypass it, compounding the issue.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
- **Incorrect URI Permission Granting:** `KEY_INTENT` should not grant URI permissions, but it was doing so.
- **Bypassable Security Check:** A security check designed for general purposes could be bypassed using `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve Information Disclosure (ID). This could potentially allow malicious applications to gain access to sensitive data or resources that they would not normally be authorized to access.

**5. Attack Vectors**
A malicious application could craft an intent to exploit the incorrect URI permissions granted by `KEY_INTENT`. The application could also utilize `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE` to bypass security checks and gain additional privileges.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
An attacker needs to have the capability to create and install a malicious application on the Android device. No specific network position is required, as the attack is local to the device.

**Additional Information:**

The commit log and the security bulletin provide specific details on the code change that addresses the issue, which is the commit ID `dba1bb07e04b51b1bd0a1251711781e731ce9524`. The commit message details that the fix involves removing any grant flags and fixing an ordering bug which allowed the `FLAG_GRANT_PERSISTABLE` flag to bypass the security check. This commit removes the URI permissions granted by `KEY_INTENT`, preventing the unauthorized access.
