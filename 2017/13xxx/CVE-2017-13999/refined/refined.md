- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not verify string size before copying to memory, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service (application crash) and arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remotely exploitable with low skill level required. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted input that overflows the buffer.
