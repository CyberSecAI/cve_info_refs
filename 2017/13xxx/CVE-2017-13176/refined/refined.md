{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the URI host parser handles multiple '@' characters within the authority segment. Instead of using the content between the first and the last '@', the parser uses the content between the last '@' and the end of the authority segment as hostname.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect parsing of URI hostnames",
      "Inconsistent hostname parsing between Android and browsers"
    ],
    "impact": "A malformed authority segment in a URI can cause the Android application to interpret a different hostname than a browser. This can lead to a security issue where an Android app perceives a URL as safe, while the browser interprets it differently. This can enable phishing attacks or other malicious activities where a user is directed to a different host than intended.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted URLs with multiple '@' characters within the authority segment"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URI with multiple '@' characters in the authority segment and lure the user to interact with it via a vulnerable Android application. The application needs to parse and use this URI for hostname determination."
