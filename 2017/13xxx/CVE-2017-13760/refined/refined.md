Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by a corrupt exFAT image. Specifically, the `fls` tool hangs while processing this corrupted image in `tsk_img_read()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite loop/Hang:** The core weakness is that the tool gets stuck in an infinite loop within the `tsk_img_read` function when encountering a specific type of corrupt exFAT image. The tool does not properly handle the malformed data, leading to the hang.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. The `fls` tool becomes unresponsive, preventing the user from using it to list file system data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The attack vector is a crafted, corrupt exFAT disk image file. The attacker provides this file as input to the `fls` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input file:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the malicious image as input to the `fls` tool. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No authentication needed:** There is no mention of authentication being required in the provided text.
