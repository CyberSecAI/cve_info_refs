{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `touch_pmd` and `touch_pud` functions in the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem were unconditionally marking page table entries as dirty, even when write access was not requested. This could lead to false positives when checking for write permissions using the can_follow_write_pmd function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unconditional modification of page table entry flags",
      "Potential for incorrect write permission checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker might be able to exploit the race condition or other vulnerability present due to the incorrect dirty bit tracking that was introduced due to this. ",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is related to the internal kernel memory management logic, with access to the system required to trigger it. The race condition due to this issue might be triggered during the process of memory management.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to execute code that triggers the affected memory management paths. This usually requires some form of local access to the system."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The commit message explicitly states that the dirty bit in the pmd/pud is currently meaningless. The patch also avoids an atomic operation that might have been required if the dirty bit had meaning. The commit also aims to fix the `false-positive can_follow_write_pmd()`."
