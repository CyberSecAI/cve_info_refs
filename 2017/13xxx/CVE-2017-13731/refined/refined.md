Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `postprocess_termcap` function within the `libncurses` library. Specifically, an illegal memory access occurs when processing termcap entries. The issue arises in the loop that copies the mapped key string, where `bp` is used to access `tp->Strings[from_ptr->nte_index]`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Illegal address access (Segmentation fault):** The code attempts to access memory at an invalid address, leading to a crash. This is caused by an out-of-bounds read when accessing `tp->Strings` using an invalid index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a crash of the application using `libncurses`. This can cause the affected application to stop functioning.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (from Gentoo advisory):** The Gentoo advisory notes the vulnerability may allow for remote code execution although the specific mechanism is not provided within this content

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted terminfo data: The vulnerability is triggered when processing malicious terminfo data through the `tic` utility. This suggests that providing specially crafted terminfo data is the main attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide crafted terminfo data: An attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted terminfo data to the `tic` utility or any application that uses `libncurses` to parse terminfo data.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability was detected using a custom fuzzer called `collAFL`.
- The specific line where the crash happens is in `parse_entry.c:870`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the command `./tic POC10` with the attached file.
- Red Hat Bugzilla marks this as a duplicate of bug 1488918.
- Gentoo security advisory mentions multiple CVE's and states that the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution

In summary, the provided content points to an out-of-bounds read in `libncurses`' `postprocess_termcap` function triggered by crafted terminfo data. This leads to a crash and could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.
