Subject: CVE-2017-13775: GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 Denial of Service issue in ReadJNXImage() in coders/jnx.c

Hi all.
Description:graphicsmagick is a collection of tools and libraries for many image formats.
We found a denial of service (DoS) issue in jnx.c at line 326, GraphicsMagick-1.3.26.The vulnerable code snippet is shown as below.
   326    for (j = 0; j < JNXLevelInfo[i].TileCount; j++)
   327      {
   328        PositionList[j].TileBounds.NorthEast.lat = ReadBlobLSBLong(image);
   329        PositionList[j].TileBounds.NorthEast.lon = ReadBlobLSBLong(image);
   330        PositionList[j].TileBounds.SouthWest.lat = ReadBlobLSBLong(image);
   331        PositionList[j].TileBounds.SouthWest.lon = ReadBlobLSBLong(image);
   332        PositionList[j].PicWidth = ReadBlobLSBShort(image);
   333        PositionList[j].PicHeight = ReadBlobLSBShort(image);
   334        PositionList[j].PicSize = ReadBlobLSBLong(image);
   335        PositionList[j].PicOffset = ReadBlobLSBLong(image);
   336      }When a crafted JNX image file, which claims large TileCount but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided,the loop at line 326 would consume huge CPU and memroy resources, since there is no EOF (End of File) check inside the loop.In our test, we used a machine with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz, 4 CPU cores and 16GB RAM.This bug caused 100% CPU and up to 4GB RAM consumption.This process lasted for about 4 minutes.

Summary: The provided content describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in GraphicsMagick version 1.3.26, specifically within the `ReadJNXImage()` function in `coders/jnx.c`.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing end-of-file (EOF) check within a loop that reads tile data from a JNX image file. The loop iterates based on a `TileCount` value read from the image header, but does not verify if the remaining data in the file is sufficient to satisfy the declared `TileCount`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking and EOF check while reading data, which leads to an infinite loop if `TileCount` is larger than the available data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by providing a crafted JNX image file with a large `TileCount` and insufficient actual data. This leads to excessive CPU and memory consumption, potentially making the system unresponsive. A test case showed the process using 100% CPU and up to 4GB of RAM for 4 minutes.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves providing a crafted JNX image file to a system using GraphicsMagick, which is processed by the `ReadJNXImage` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JNX image file to a system utilizing GraphicsMagick. No specific position is required other than the ability to pass input to the vulnerable application.
