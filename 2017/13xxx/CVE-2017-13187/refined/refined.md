Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the handling of incomplete coded tree blocks (CTBs) within the libhevc library when processing HEVC video streams. Specifically, the issue arises during slice header parsing, where the decision to signal missing CTBs was being made prematurely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of Incomplete CTBs:** The code failed to correctly manage incomplete CTBs, which could lead to parsing errors.
- **Premature Decision Making:** The decision to signal missing CTBs for previous slices was being made too early, potentially before the current slice parsing was complete, leading to a potential parsing error

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service. This is noted as a High severity DoS for Android versions 5.1.1, 6.0, and 6.0.1

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HEVC Video Stream:** An attacker can craft a malicious HEVC video stream containing incomplete CTBs, specifically crafted to trigger the vulnerability during parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to provide the crafted HEVC video stream to the vulnerable device. This could be through a malicious media file, or by other means that would cause the device to process the specially crafted video stream.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involved moving the decision of signalling missing CTBs from previous slices to the end of the current slice header parsing. This ensures no error during slice header parsing occurs.

- The vulnerability was addressed in AOSP versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0 and 8.1, but is also listed with a high impact DoS for versions 5.1.1, 6.0 and 6.0.1
