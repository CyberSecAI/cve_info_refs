Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `libmpeg2` library. Specifically, it arises when the decoder processes multiple sequence headers with differing dimensions. If a change in resolution occurs in the second header (after a reset call), the decoder fails to properly handle the change and return an error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service. The decoder's failure to handle a resolution change after a reset call can lead to a state where the system is unresponsive or crashes while processing malicious input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted MPEG2 file with multiple sequence headers with differing dimensions to cause a denial-of-service condition. This can result in the affected device becoming unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially crafted file:** The vulnerability is triggered by feeding the vulnerable media framework with a specially crafted MPEG2 file.
- The file needs to contain multiple sequence headers that include different dimensions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to deliver the specially crafted MPEG2 file to the targeted device. This could be achieved through various channels like MMS, email, a website, or file sharing.
- No special privileges are explicitly required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit message clarifies that the fix involves ensuring the decoder returns an error when it encounters changes in resolution in subsequent headers after a reset call.
- The AOSP commit link shows the specific code change made to address this vulnerability.
