Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13734:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `_nc_safe_strcat` function within `strings.c` of the ncurses library.
- Specifically, the issue arises from an illegal memory access when `strlen` is called on the `src` pointer which is not pointing to a valid memory address. This causes a segmentation fault.
- The vulnerability occurs when processing malformed terminfo data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-  An invalid memory address is passed to `strlen`, resulting in an illegal memory access (segmentation fault).
-  The `_nc_safe_strcat` function, intended for safe string concatenation, fails to validate the source pointer before calling `strlen`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can be triggered to cause a crash in the application using the ncurses library (like `infotocap`), resulting in a denial of service.
-   Remote Code Execution (RCE): The Gentoo security advisory mentions that exploitation *could* lead to RCE, although the provided Red Hat bugzilla data only demonstrates DoS. This suggests the potential for more severe consequences, possibly through crafted input that exploits the memory corruption, even though the provided crash is just a segmentation fault due to invalid memory access.

**Attack vectors:**

- The primary attack vector involves processing untrusted or malformed terminfo data.
- An attacker can entice a user or application to process maliciously crafted terminfo data, potentially triggering the vulnerability.
- The `infotocap` utility is mentioned as a program that can be used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to provide the malformed terminfo data to be processed by the vulnerable application, this can be achieved through tricking a user into opening such a file or by injecting it into an application that does not properly sanitize the terminfo data
- This can be achieved either remotely, or through local file access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Red Hat bug report mentions that the issue was triggered by a custom fuzzer, "collAFL," which suggests the vulnerability is relatively easy to find with a fuzzer.
- The fix was included in ncurses version 6.1.
- The issue was initially reported with a problematic test case, which was later fixed with a modified Proof of Concept (POC)
- The vulnerability is marked as "CLOSED DUPLICATE" in the Red Hat bugzilla, referencing bug 1488922, which is also marked as "WONTFIX" indicating the issue is not going to be addressed through the normal patching process.
- The Gentoo security advisory lists this CVE alongside other ncurses vulnerabilities which may have similar characteristics.
