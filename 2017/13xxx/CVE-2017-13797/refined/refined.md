Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13797:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) within the `WebCore::PositionIterator::decrement` function of WebKit.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: A memory location is freed, and then subsequently accessed, which is a classic memory corruption issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The exploit demonstrated a crash due to a heap-use-after-free, leading to a denial of service (DoS). However, given the nature of UAF vulnerabilities, successful exploitation could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the application using the vulnerable WebKit.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing maliciously crafted web content. This is demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept HTML code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a vulnerable application (Safari, iTunes, iCloud for Windows, tvOS) to process the malicious HTML content. This could be done by hosting the malicious page on a website or by delivering the malicious HTML content via other channels (e.g., phishing email).

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ivan Fratric of Google Project Zero.
- The provided exploit code and ASan log show exactly how the use-after-free occurs. The PoC triggers a series of DOM manipulations and then calls `document.execCommand("selectAll", false)` which, combined with some event handling, leads to the use-after-free in `WebCore::PositionIterator::decrement`.

- The vulnerability is present in multiple products from Apple:
    - Safari for macOS
    - iTunes for Windows
    - iCloud for Windows
    - tvOS
    - iOS
