{
  "CVE-2017-13210": {
    "Root cause": "The source size passed by the client could be smaller than the actual size of 'camera_metadata_t', leading to an incorrect cast in 'allocate_copy_camera_metadata_checked()'. This results in accessing invalid heap memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect size check",
       "Improper type casting",
      "Heap out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Elevation of privilege. Accessing invalid heap memory can lead to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious application could provide a crafted source size when allocating and copying camera metadata.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Malicious application needs to use the Camera API and manipulate the metadata size passed during the allocation process."
  }
