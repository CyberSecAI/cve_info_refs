The provided content is related to CVE-2017-13092.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improperly specified HDL syntax within the P1735 IEEE standard. This lack of proper specification allows an attacker to use an EDA tool as a decryption oracle.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improperly specified HDL syntax that allows using an EDA tool as a decryption oracle.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can recover plaintext intellectual property (IP) without the key.
- An attacker can insert hardware Trojans into encrypted IP.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack leverages the commercial EDA tool as a black-box oracle.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs access to an EDA tool that supports the flawed P1735 standard.
- The attacker has to be able to provide the encrypted IP to the EDA tool for processing.
