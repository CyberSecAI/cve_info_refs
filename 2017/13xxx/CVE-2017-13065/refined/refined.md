{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `GetStyleTokens()` function in `coders/svg.c`. This function improperly handles the parsing of style attributes in SVG files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation",
      "Inconsistent initialization of variables."
     ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to the memory corruption and potential for arbitrary code execution by processing malformed SVG files.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious SVG file with a specially crafted style attribute which when processed by `GetStyleTokens()` will trigger a buffer overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted SVG file to the vulnerable application for processing. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
