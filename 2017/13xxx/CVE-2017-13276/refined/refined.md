Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13276:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An invalid `FrontElementHeightInfo` array value in the MPEG-4 AAC decoder can cause a stack overflow. Specifically, the issue lies in the `CProgramConfig_ReadHeightExt` function where the height info is read, without proper validation, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation of `FrontElementHeightInfo` array values within the AAC decoder.
- Stack overflow due to writing potentially large, unchecked values into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) within the context of a privileged process. This allows an attacker to gain control over the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specially crafted MPEG-4 AAC file. When the vulnerable device processes this malicious file, it triggers the stack overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted AAC file to the vulnerable device. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    - Embedding the file in a malicious webpage.
    - Sending the file as a multimedia message.
    - Tricking the user into downloading and playing the malicious file.
    
**Additional notes:**

- The provided commit message indicates that the fix prevents stack overflow in the  `CProgramConfig_ReadHeightExt` function by validating the `FrontElementHeightInfo` array value.
- The CVE description from the Android Security Bulletin confirms that this vulnerability falls within the Media framework and can lead to remote code execution.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Android versions (6.0, 6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, and 8.1).
