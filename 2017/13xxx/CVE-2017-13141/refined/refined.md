Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-13141:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `ReadOnePNGImage` function located in `png.c` of ImageMagick. This function is responsible for processing PNG image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** Specifically, the `ReadOnePNGImage` function does not properly free allocated memory when processing a crafted or corrupted PNG file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By repeatedly triggering the memory leak with specially crafted PNG files, an attacker can exhaust the available memory of the system, eventually leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PNG File:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PNG file that will cause the vulnerable `ReadOnePNGImage` function to leak memory when processed by ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by enticing a user or an application to process the malicious PNG file using ImageMagick. The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes**
* The issue was initially reported as a memory leak in `ReadOneJNGImage` (related to JNG image format, which is closely related to PNG) but was later corrected to be `ReadOnePNGImage`.
* The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2017-13141.
* The issue was fixed in ImageMagick version 6.9.9.20 and later.
* The fix was applied in Debian as part of a security update, with the vulnerability addressed in version 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-15.
