The provided content relates to CVE-2017-13891.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an inconsistent user interface issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way `SafariViewController` manages its state, leading to an inconsistent user interface. This allows for potential address bar spoofing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to address bar spoofing. This means a malicious website can potentially make itself appear to be a legitimate site, tricking users into providing sensitive information or taking other harmful actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through visiting a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to host a malicious website that can exploit the inconsistent state management in `SafariViewController`. The attacker doesn't need a privileged network position or any specific access to the target system beyond the ability to have the victim visit their site.
