Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10804:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way `psycopg2` (versions prior to 2.6.3) handles database query parameters containing NUL (0x00) bytes. Instead of properly escaping or handling them, `psycopg2` passes these parameters unmodified to the underlying `libpq` database driver. This allows for the injection of unexpected or truncated data to the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NUL Byte Injection:** The core vulnerability lies in the failure to handle NUL bytes in query parameters, leading to data truncation. This can bypass checks and validations by the application when interacting with the database.
*   **Access Control Bypass**: In the specific context of Odoo, this flaw in `psycopg2` can be exploited to bypass the authentication system. The issue arises because of how Odoo handles authentication and password verification with parameters passed to database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can potentially bypass the password verification mechanism by crafting a specific request. This allows an attacker to log in as any user on the system without having the password.
*  **Data Integrity Issues**: The truncation of data can lead to unexpected values being stored or queried, potentially impacting the integrity of application data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitable:** The attack vector is network-based, allowing remote exploitation.
*  **Crafted Requests**: Attackers must craft specific requests containing NUL bytes in the parameters passed to database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges Required:** Only low privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability
* **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Understanding of Odoo Authentication:** An attacker needs to have some understanding of how Odoo's authentication layer interacts with the database.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Nils Hamerlinck
*   The issue is present in all Odoo versions
*   Odoo versions 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 are all affected and have been patched in the commits listed:
    * 8.0: eb8d919
    * 9.0: e3a52a9
    * 10.0: 4acfe35
*   The advisory provides two solutions: upgrading Odoo and/or upgrading psycopg2 to a version >=2.6.3.
