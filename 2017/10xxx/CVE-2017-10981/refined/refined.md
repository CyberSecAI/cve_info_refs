{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `fr_dhcp_decode()` function in FreeRADIUS server has a memory leak when option decoding fails.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause the FreeRADIUS server to consume an increasing amount of memory, potentially leading to a crash due to memory exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted DHCP packets to the FreeRADIUS server with malformed options."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Any network device capable of sending DHCP packets to FreeRADIUS, with the ability to send malformed option parameters.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in `fr_dhcp_decode()` function. Affected versions are 2.0.0 through 2.2.9 inclusive. DHCP is not enabled by default in FreeRADIUS, it has to be explicitly enabled by the administrator. The vulnerability can be triggered by any network device that can send malformed DHCP packets to the server."
