| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1468493#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 09:01:09 UTC  ``` It was discovered that decode_tlv() function leaked memory in certain circumstances.  The security impact is denial of service by any network device capable of sending DHCP packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends option 82 with multiple sub-options.  Affected versions: 2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1468493#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 09:01:15 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the FreeRADIUS project Upstream: Guido Vranken   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1468493#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 12:14:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1295280](attachment.cgi?id=1295280&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1295280&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1468493#c6)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-07-17 14:32:40 UTC  ``` Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1471852](show_bug.cgi?id=1471852 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-10980 freeradius: Memory leak in decode_tlv() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1468493#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-07-18 03:42:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:1759 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1759](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1759)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1468493#c8)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-08-02 09:46:21 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://freeradius.org/security/fuzzer-2017.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 09:07:02 UTC  ``` It was discovered that if option decoding fails, the fr_dhcp_decode() function would leak memory.  The security impact is denial of service via memory exhaustion by any network device capable of sending DHCP packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.  Affected versions: 2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 09:07:09 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the FreeRADIUS project Upstream: Guido Vranken   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 12:13:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1295278](attachment.cgi?id=1295278&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1295278&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c6)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-07-17 14:33:45 UTC  ``` Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1471853](show_bug.cgi?id=1471853 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-10981 freeradius: Memory leak in fr_dhcp_decode() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-07-18 03:42:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:1759 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1759](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1759)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c8)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-08-02 09:47:04 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://freeradius.org/security/fuzzer-2017.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

An update for freeradius is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable free Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server, designed to allow centralized authentication and authorization for a network.

Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server or to execute arbitrary code in the context of the FreeRADIUS server process by sending a specially crafted request packet. (CVE-2017-10979)
* An out-of-bounds read and write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled RADIUS packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted RADIUS packet. (CVE-2017-10978)
* Multiple memory leak flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause the FreeRADIUS server to consume an increasing amount of memory resources over time, possibly leading to a crash due to memory exhaustion, by sending specially crafted DHCP packets. (CVE-2017-10980, CVE-2017-10981)
* Multiple out-of-bounds read flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP request. (CVE-2017-10982, CVE-2017-10983)

Red Hat would like to thank the FreeRADIUS project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of these issues.

# Issues found via fuzzing by Guido Vranken

In June 2017, [Guido
Vranken](https://guidovranken.wordpress.com/) found a number of issues with OpenVPN. One issue was a
slow memory leak due to mis-use of the OpenSSL API. He contacted us
to say that FreeRADIUS had the same issue as OpenVPN.
We [fixed](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/c7f120e8c16841e45656ee9e8175e0b3302c1b1e)
that issue immediately in the
the [v2.x.x](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commits/v2.x.x)
branch, and also
[fixed](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/e2c80d363778c1c63461cc15bd509b1122982509)
it in
the [v3.0.x](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commits/v3.0.x)
branch, and the v4.0.x branch. The v3.1.x branch is unsupported, and
has been deleted. Similarly, we do not discuss the v0 or v1 releases,
as those are end of life and unsupported.

In order to improve the security of FreeRADIUS, we asked Guido to try
fuzzing FreeRADIUS. He spent a week working with us, and managed to
find a number of issues. We worked together to create and validate
fixes for all of them.
His [blog](https://guidovranken.wordpress.com/2017/07/17/11-remote-vulnerabilities-inc-2x-rce-in-freeradius-packet-parsers/)
contains a short note on the subject.

The short summary is that if your RADIUS server is on a private
network, accessible only by managed devices, you are likely safe. If
your RADIUS server is part of a roaming consortium, then anyone within
that consortium can attack it. If your RADIUS server is on the public
internet, then you are not following best practices, and anyone on the
net can attack your systems.

## Secure coding in C

Given the scope of these issues, there needs to be a statement on
the security aspects of coding in C. In short, C is a terrible
language for security. We have understood this for many years, and
have taken pro-active steps to deal with the limitations of C. For
example, we worked with Coverity as far back
as [2007](https://www.cnet.com/news/open-source-bug-hunt-project-expands/)
to scan FreeRADIUS.

Starting from version 3, all versions of the server have built with
zero compiler warnings. All releases have passed static analyis
by [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/), [Clang
analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/),
and [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/). We have
also
used [PVS-Studio](https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/),
with [results here](pvs-studio.html). Each
static analysis tool has it's pros and cons, and each one usually
finds things which are missed by all of the others.

We also have hundreds of regression tests, which check that "well
formed" attributes and packets are decoded correctly, and that
"malformed" attributes and packets do not cause misbehavior in the
server.

As is apparent from this page, those processes are not enough to
ensure secure C code. In short:

*There are about as many issues disclosed in this page as in the previous ten
years combined.*

We will therefore be integrating the fuzzer into all future releases
of the server. We will be updating our automated build system to run
with memory sanitizers enabled. We **strongly recommend** that
other software projects follow the same practices.

**If multiple static analyers and hundreds of regression tests are not
enough for us to find these security issues, they are probably not
enough for you, either.**

## Summary of Issues

This page summarizes his findings, along with our response,
analysis, and fixes. The items are labeled *FR-GV-###*,
followed by which version(s) of the server are affected (v2, v3,
etc.), and finally by a short description. His work led us to do
additional tests, which found other issues that are
labeled *FR-AD-###*.

The issues below were found via fuzzing and address sanitization
checks. Not all are exploitable. Out of 15 issues, 5 have no
possible exploit. Six (6) issues are only for DHCP, leaving 4 for RADIUS.

[FR-AD-003 (v3) Incorrect statement length passed into sqlite3\_prepare](#FR-AD-003)

For some issues, the same or similar code appears in all versions of
FreeRADIUS. i.e. from version 2, to version 3, and the "in
development" v4.0.x branch. As a result, we present the findings by
issue, and state which versions are affected. Where issues only apply
one version, we show them for version 2, and then version 3. We do
not discuss the v4.0.x branch here, as it has not had an official
release. Finally, these issues affect all releases of FreeRADIUS
version 2 and 3.

On July 17 2017, we will release versions 2.2.10 and 3.0.15 in
order to address these issues. Guido has provided us with the source
for the fuzzers. The fuzzers will be integrated into future releases
of FreeRADIUS.

## RADIUS Security

Before we discuss the issues, we must first give the reader some
background on RADIUS security and associated best practices.

In general, RADIUS security can only be described as "poor". The
protocol was designed in 1993, and uses MD5 to sign packets with a
"shared secret". While MD5 has been broken, no one has shown that the
attacks on MD5 can be extended to attack RADIUS. That is, packets
which are signed with the shared secret are considered to be sent from
a "trusted" source.

The design of RADIUS ensures that all packets except Access-Request
are signed. In FreeRADIUS, this signature is checked prior to any
packet decoding. This check ensures that only packets from "trusted"
sources are accepted by the server. In most cases, therefore, only
packets from those "trusted" sources can exploit these issues.

While the Access-Request packets are not signed by default, RADIUS
provides for a signature via the Message-Authenticator attribute.
Again, packets signed via this method are from "trusted" sources, and
only those sources can exploit these issues.

However, many NAS implementations do not send a
Message-Authenticator attribute in Access-Request packets. In those
situations, any attacker who can forge packets from the NAS to the
RADIUS server can have those packets accepted by the server, and can
exploit these issues.

This security issue in RADIUS has been known for over a
decade. [RFC
5080 Section 2.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5080#section-2.2.2) says in part:

However, Access-Request packets not containing a Message-

We **strongly** recommend that vendors update their firmware to
include a Message-Authenticator attribute in all Access-Request
packets. Where this change is not possible, we **strongly**
recommend that all RADIUS administrators ensure that RADIUS traffic is
on a secure management network. That is, end users **should not**
be able to send any network traffic to a RADIUS server.

All versions of FreeRADIUS from version 2.0.0 onwards have provided
for a per-client
configuration `require_message_authenticator`. This flag
rejects all Access-Request packets which do not contain a valid
Message-Authenticator attribute. We recommend that this flag be
enabled where possible. Once this flag is set, even in old an
un-patched versions of the server, the issues discussed here can only
be exploited by "trusted" sources. Also, as of version 2.1.3,
FreeRADIUS has ensured that proxied Access-Request packets always
contain a Message-Authenticator attribute. This change ensures that
all systems which receive Access-Request packets from a FreeRADIUS
proxy can set the `require_message_authenticator` flag.

While this limitation minimizes the impact of these issues, it does
not remove it entirely. Roaming agreements may provide for packets to
be sent from parties who are largely unknown to the recipient, but who
are within a "trusted" roaming coalition. We believe that breaches of
trust by "trusted" parties are best dealt with via administrative
means, and not technical ones. Still, we should still ensure that
trusted parties are unable to exploit our trust in order to perform
malicious actions.

Where is necessary to be part of a roaming consortium, administrators
should ensure that all RADIUS traffic over the public Internet is
encrypted with IPSec or TLS. We *do not* recommend placing a
RADIUS server on the public net. **Even independent of the issues
disclosed here, the security of the RADIUS protocol is insufficient to
guarantee safe operation on the public Internet.**

## DHCP Security

Finally, we note that the discussion above is about RADIUS security,
and does not apply to DHCP. Unfortunately, DHCP protocol security can
best be described as "in practice, non-existent". Unlike RADIUS, DHCP
allows end users to send packets directly to DHCP servers. This
capability means that it is harder for administrators to shield their
DHCP servers from malicious parties.

We note that while FreeRADIUS includes DHCP functionality, it is not
enabled by default. Administrators must take explicit action to
configure it. As such, most FreeRADIUS sites are not vulnerable to
the DHCP issues disclosed here. We still, however, recommend
upgrading to a version which contains fixes for these issues.

# Issues

The follow list describes each issue in detail. Included in each
description are a statement in impact, exploit vector (where
appropriate), a link to the fix, which versions are affected, and
where appropriate, a CVE identifier.

## FR-GV-201 (v2,v3) Read / write overflow in make\_secret()

**Issue:**  The `make_secret()` function does not
properly check for output buffer size before writing data. It can
perform a read or write overflow of up to 16 octets.

**Impact:**  Minimal. The issue will be see when the server is
sending a RADIUS packet that is almost at the maximum (4K octets), and
the last attribute in the packet is an Ascend-Send-Secret (or similar)
attribute. The data being written is an MD5 digest of the shared
secret, concatenated to data which is under the attackers control.

The issue will also be seen when receiving a packet that has an
Ascend-Send-Secret (or similar) attribute of the wrong size. The
server will read data past the end of the attribute, up to a limit of
16 octets.

**Exploit vector:**  Read or write overflow, by anyone who can
send packets which are accepted by the server.

Home servers which send large Access-Accept responses, with an
Ascend-Send-Secret attribute as the last one in the packet, and where
the proxy does minimal packet editing, *may* be able crash a
proxy which receives that Access-Accept and forwards it to a NAS.

**Fix:**  Ensure that the `make_secret()` function
checks for bounds on the encapsulating packet. Fixed in
[FR-GV-201
(v2)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/38ee90f2a5a28dc5887a30bdfdc98109c0418e68), and
in [FR-GV-201
(v3)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/fc8662d7e827f630d515eaa0bddfa94754c8047f).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10978](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10978). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

## FR-GV-202 (v2) Read overflow in rad\_coalesce

**Issue:**  The `rad_coalesce()` function checks for
WiMAX attributes which are too small, but it does not check for WiMAX
attributes which are too large. As a result, the server can be
convinced to read past the end of an attribute, which may overflow the
heap, leading to a crash.

If the heap does not overflow, the only side-effect is the creation of
a WiMAX attribute with "too much" data. The extra data is copied from
the memory which is past the end of the attribute. That data is under
control of an attacker, as with all other data in the forged packet.
There do not appear to be any side-effects of using this bad data.

*Earlier versions of this page suggested there was a write overflow
vulnerability. Additional investigation showed this to be wrong.*

This issue does not appear in version 3, as that code was re-written,
and the `rad_coalesce` function does not exist in those
branches. However, similar issues appear in
the `data2vp_wimax()` function in version 3.

**Impact:**  Write overflow, possibly remote exploit by anyone
who can send packets which are accepted by the server.

**Exploit vector:**  The issue happens when the server receives
any packet containing malformed WiMAX attributes. One example of this
issue is the following data: `1a 0a 00 00 60 b5 2c 04 80 00 1a 09
00 00 60 b5 2c fa 00`. Similar formats can be used with other
WiMAX attributes, e.g. where the `2c` octet is replace by
other values. The exploit here is the `fa`. That octet
indicates that there are 250 octets of data remaining in the
attribute, while in fact there is only one octet.

**Fix:**  Check for attributes which are "too long", in addition
to checking for attributes which are "too short". Fixed in [FR-GV-202](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ae3ba0011e7d299e92c45300e0137a56a650e8f5).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10979](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10979). Remote code
execution is not possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-203 (v2) DHCP - Memory leak in decode\_tlv()

**Issue: the `decode_tlv()` function leaked memory in certain circumstances.**

**Impact:**  Memory leak, potentially leading to memory
exhaustion.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends option 82 with multiple sub-options.

**Fix:**  Link all decoded attributes into the decoded packet. Fixed in [FR-GV-203](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ef0727fc68e211a36637b5c4e4a6fa1326f0a029).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10980](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10980). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-204 (v2) DHCP - Memory leak in fr\_dhcp\_decode()

**Issue:**  If option decoding fails,
the `fr_dhcp_decode()` function would leak memory.

**Impact:**  Memory leak, potentially leading to memory
exhaustion.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.

**Fix:**  Free partially decoded options on error. Fixed in
[FR-GV-204](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/812766e2150faa07b4c574e51393b014feaffe6c)

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10981](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10981). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-205 (v2) DHCP - Read overflow in fr\_dhcp\_decode\_options()

**Issue:**  The `fr_dhcp_decode_options()` function
does not do proper bounds checks on option lengths, leading to out of
bounds reads.

**Impact:**  The server can read up to 253 octets more data than
it should. Depending on memory layout, this read may initiate a page
fault, and cause the server to crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.

**Fix:**  Check for options which are "too long", in addition
to checking for attributes which are "too short". Fixed in [FR-GV-205](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/10b6de9345c9e0d9d4d5e0426fa5c3d68d702875).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10982](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10982). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-206 (v2,v3) DHCP - Read overflow when decoding option 63

**Issue:**  The `fr_dhcp_decode()` function performed
a `strcmp()` on binary data in an internal data structure,
instead of checking the length of the option and doing
a `memcmp`.

**Impact:**  The server can read memory until it reaches a
zero byte. Depending on memory layout, this read may initiate a page
fault, and cause the server to crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends a DHCP option 63 with non-zero
contents.

**Fix:**  Examine option 60, instead of option 63, and check for option length. Fixed in [FR-GV-206 (v2)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ec08b30f87066f82073d02fab57e8ffeef81373d), and [FR-GV-206 (v3)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/5759b20af99af6d30924f0efd8da5eac2a17163d).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10983](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10983). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-207 (v2) Zero-length malloc() in data2vp()

**Issue:**  When decoding attributes of type "tlv", the decoder
can call `malloc()` with an argument of zero.

**Impact:**  None. The length of the allocated data is kept
separately in the `vp->length` field. All dereferences to
the allocated data are protected by a check for `vp->length >
0`

**Exploit vector:**  None.

**Fix:**  For general safety, the function was changed to avoid
a zero-length `malloc()`. Fixed in [FR-GV-207](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/26be8a680d2a6830e7be98bee10818dd8b6a426a)

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  No CVE has been release as this issue has no impact,
and exploitation does not cross a privilege boundary in a correct and
realistic product deployment.

---

## FR-GV-301 (v3) Write overflow in data2vp\_wimax()

**Issue:**  This issue is similar
to [FR-GV-202](#FR-GV-202), as the code in v3 is based on
the code in v2. However, as the issue is slightly different, it is
listed separately.

**Impact:**  Write overflow, possibly remote exploit by anyone
who can send packets which are accepted by the server.

**Exploit vector:**  Sending WiMAX attributes which have the
"continuation" flag set, but for which there is no subsequent data.

**Fix:**  Update checks for malformed attributes. Fixed
in [FR-GV-301](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/931850e5d2f65193520c2d9c9878148c0cdc16a6),
with a related patch
in [another
patch](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/4b059296e14b6ab75dc17163077490528a819806).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10984](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10984). Remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-302 (v3) Infinite loop and memory exhaustion with 'concat' attributes

**Issue:**  When the server receives zero-length attributes
marked 'concat' in the dictionaries, it could go into an infinite loop
and exhaust memory.

**Impact:**  Infinite loop and memory exhaustion, by anyone
who can send packets which are accepted by the server.

**Exploit vector:**  The issue happens when the server receives
a packet containing the following attribute data: `4f
02`, `89 02`, `90 02`, or `b4
02`.

**Fix:**  Update `decode_concat()` function to return
the bytes read from the packet, not the length of the attribute data. Fixed in [FR-GV-302](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/6726c16549b131ed39f6f8886cdf5d9d922a9a97).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10985](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10985). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-303 (v3) DHCP - Infinite read in dhcp\_attr2vp()

**Issue:**  When decoding "string" options in an
array, `dhcp_attr2vp()` could be convinced to
call `memchr()` with a length argument of `-1`.
This could result in an over-read until the first zero octet was
found, or a page fault occured.

**Impact:**  Possible infinite read overflow, or crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends string options to the server in an
option array.

**Fix:**  Perform better bounds checking on decoding string
options in an array. Fixed
in [FR-GV-303](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/21e2e95751bfb54c0fb0328392d06671a75c191c).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10986](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10986). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-304 (v3) DHCP - Buffer over-read in fr\_dhcp\_decode\_suboptions()

**Issue:**  The `fr_dhcp_decode_suboptions()`
function does not properly check if sub-options overflow the packet.

This issue is similar to [FR-GV-205](#FR-GV-205), as the
code in v3 is based on the code in v2. However, as the issue is
slightly different, it is listed separately.

**Impact:**  The server can read up to a small number of octets
more data than it should. Depending on memory layout, this read may
initiate a page fault, and cause the server to crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.

**Fix:**  Check for options which are "too long", in addition
to checking for attributes which are "too short". Fixed in [FR-GV-304](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/19a18bf7c8af649c9e9742fb6a046f6aff639866).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10987](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10987). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-305 (v3) Decode 'signed' attributes correctly

**Issue:**  Attributes of data type 'signed' would sometimes be
created from uninitialized memory, instead of from the received packet.

**Impact:**  Minimal. No overflow or exploit is possible.
Instead, the attribute sometimes has a garbage value. There is only
one 'signed' attribute, which is in the WiMAX dictionaries, and it is
used only in certain limited situations.

**Exploit vector:**  None.

**Fix:**  Decode the attribute correctly. Fixed
in [FR-GV-305](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/de3b3b2e4153db26442facbd5e9b268a3bf795ba).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  None.
No remote code execution is possible. No denial of service is
possible. Exploitation does not cross a privilege boundary in a
correct and realistic product deployment.

---

## FR-AD-001 (v2,v3) Use strncmp() instead of memcmp() for string data

**Issue:**  When reading data from configuration files, the
server could over-read to to 4 octets of data.

**Impact:**  Minimal.

**Exploit vector:**  Administrators who have write access to the
server configuration files.

**Fix:**  Use `strncmp()` instead
of `memcmp()` for bounded comparisons on C strings. Fixed in [FR-AD-001 (v2)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/30c9f53f85a9d07f5213789ea9efbd06d6fc67d8), and
in [FR-AD-001 (v3)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/41dfe9f0ca550ceb5f152ba8baf03fd6222d7119).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

---

## FR-AD-002 (v3) String lifetime issues in rlm\_python

**Issue:**  The `PySys_SetPath()`
and `PySys_SetName()` functions require a long-lived
pointer to the path / name.

**Impact:**  Potential crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Administrators who have write access to the
server configuration files.

**Fix:**  Use a long-lived string instead of a short-lived one. Fixed in [FR-AD-002](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/a1eccee1872b4019e98e399f0f4597a41ef057a7).

**CVE:**  No CVE has been release as this issue has no impact,
and exploitation does not cross a privilege boundary in a correct and
realistic product deployment.

---

## FR-AD-003 (v3) Incorrect statement length passed into sqlite3\_prepare

**Issue:**

An incorrect statement length was passed into the `sqlite3_prepare()` function.

**Impact:**  Potential crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Administrators who have write access to the
server configuration files.

**Fix:**  Use the correct statement length. Fixed in [FR-AD-003](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/62f7d2885ad02911f0ae71e7864d4805a489137b).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  No CVE has been release as this issue has no impact,
and exploitation does not cross a privilege boundary in a correct and
realistic product deployment.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1468498#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 09:10:17 UTC  ``` The fr_dhcp_decode_options() function does not do proper bounds checks on option lengths, leading to out-of-bounds read.  The server can read up to 253 octets more data than it should. Depending on memory layout, this read may initiate a page fault, and cause the server to crash.   The security impact is denial of service by any network device capable of sending DHCP packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.  Affected versions: 2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1468498#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 09:10:25 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the FreeRADIUS project Upstream: Guido Vranken   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1468498#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 12:12:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1295277](attachment.cgi?id=1295277&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1295277&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1468498#c6)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-07-17 14:34:49 UTC  ``` Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1471858](show_bug.cgi?id=1471858 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-10982 freeradius: Out-of-bounds read in fr_dhcp_decode_options() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1468498#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-07-18 03:42:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:1759 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1759](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1759)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1468498#c8)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-08-02 09:44:20 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://freeradius.org/security/fuzzer-2017.html>   ``` |  |

Package        : freeradius
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-10978 CVE-2017-10979 CVE-2017-10980 CVE-2017-10981
                 CVE-2017-10982 CVE-2017-10983 CVE-2017-10984 CVE-2017-10985
                 CVE-2017-10986 CVE-2017-10987
Debian Bug     : 868765

Guido Vranken discovered that FreeRADIUS, an open source
implementation of RADIUS, the IETF protocol for AAA (Authorisation,
Authentication, and Accounting), did not properly handle memory when
processing packets. This would allow a remote attacker to cause a
denial-of-service by application crash, or potentially execute
arbitrary code.

All those issues are covered by this single DSA, but it's worth noting
that not all issues affect all releases:

  - CVE-2017-10978 and CVE-2017-10983 affect both jessie and stretch

  - CVE-2017-10979, CVE-2017-10980, CVE-2017-10981 and CVE-2017-10982
    affect only jessie

  - CVE-2017-10984, CVE-2017-10985, CVE-2017-10986 and CVE-2017-10987
    affect only stretch.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.5+dfsg-0.2+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.12+dfsg-5+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your freeradius packages.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)
