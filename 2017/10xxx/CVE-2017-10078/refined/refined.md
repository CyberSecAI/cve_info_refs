Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the Nashorn JavaScript engine in OpenJDK, where it incompletely blocks access to Java APIs. This means that even when access to Java APIs is explicitly disabled, the Nashorn engine can still allow scripts to interact with them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core vulnerability is the failure to properly restrict access to Java APIs when such access is intended to be disabled.
*   **Bypass of Restrictions:** The Nashorn engine's flawed implementation allows JavaScript code to circumvent intended security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Bypass:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to bypass Java sandbox restrictions, gaining unauthorized access to resources they should not be able to reach.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the context and the exposed Java APIs, attackers might be able to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the running Java process, though some information suggests this requires an additional step.
*   **Data Access/Modification:** There's a potential for attackers to gain unauthorized access to or modify critical data accessible to the Java application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Untrusted JavaScript Execution:** The primary attack vector involves executing untrusted or malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable Nashorn engine.
*   **RMI Registry and Java RMI applications** Exploitation may lead to arbitrary code execution with privileges of RMI Registry or Java RMI applications.
*   **Web Start Applications and Applets:** The vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets as well as by supplying data to APIs without using sandboxed applets, such as through a web service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within an environment using the vulnerable Nashorn engine.
*   **Low Privilege access (for some vectors)**: Some vectors may only require low privileged access.
*   **Network Access:** Network access to the target system is often needed. For RMI attacks, the attacker needs network access to RMI registry.
*   **User Interaction (for some vectors)**: For some vectors the user must visit a malicious web site or run a specially crafted application or applet to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Oracle Java SE and OpenJDK.
*   Multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) address this vulnerability in different Red Hat products.
*   Patches and upgrades for affected products are provided by vendors like Red Hat and Oracle.
*   Some documents mention the issue was fixed in Oracle JDK 8u141, 7u151, and 6u161
*   Specific OpenJDK commits fix the vulnerability <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/nashorn/rev/7c09d30a05f1>
