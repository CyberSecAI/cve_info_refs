Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `grub_memmove` function. This function is used by the GRUB bootloader library within radare2. The overflow occurs when reading data from disk via `grub_disk_read` function and further used in `grub_ext2_iterate_dir`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The `grub_memmove` function attempts to copy data into a buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to a heap buffer overflow. Specifically, the write operation in `grub_memmove` attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer. This is triggered during the processing of an EXT2 filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The most immediate impact is a crash of the radare2 application due to the AddressSanitizer detecting the heap buffer overflow.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, heap buffer overflows can potentially be leveraged by attackers to overwrite heap metadata or other critical data, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a significant security risk, especially if an attacker can control the contents being copied via the `grub_memmove` function.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious File System Image:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious EXT2 file system image and then loading it with radare2. By carefully structuring the data within the file system image (specifically within directories), the attacker can trigger the vulnerable `grub_memmove` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input to radare2:** An attacker needs to be able to load a malicious file system image into radare2. This can be accomplished through:
    - Providing the crafted EXT2 file system to an application that uses the vulnerable code.
    - In scenarios where an attacker has access to the target system, they can load the malicious disk image directly via the `r2` command.

**More details than CVE description:**

- The provided information includes a detailed call trace of the crash within radare2 along with the ASAN output.
- It also has the exact line numbers where the vulnerability was triggered along with the specific function call (`grub_memmove` and `grub_disk_read`).
- It also mentions the specific vulnerable function `grub_memmove`, the vulnerable file `shlr/grub/kern/misc.c` and vulnerable disk read function `grub_disk_read`.
- The commit diff provides the fix applied and a high level idea of the fix implemented to mitigate the vulnerability.
