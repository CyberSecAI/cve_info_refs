  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-10664",
    "description": "Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with the Network Block Device (NBD) Server support is vulnerable to a crash via a SIGPIPE signal. The crash can occur if a client aborts a connection due to any failure during negotiation or read operation. A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "affected_components": [
      "qemu-kvm",
      "qemu-nbd"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The qemu-nbd server does not handle the SIGPIPE signal correctly, leading to a crash when the client aborts the connection during negotiation or read operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of SIGPIPE signal",
      "Denial of service vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote user/process could cause a denial of service by crashing the qemu-nbd server.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote user/process can connect to the qemu-nbd server and abort the connection during negotiation or read operation.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate a connection with the qemu-nbd server.",
    "cvss_base_score": "Moderate",
     "remediation": "Apply security patches provided by the vendor."
