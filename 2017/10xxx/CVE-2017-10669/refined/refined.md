- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OSCI-Transport library is vulnerable to a signature wrapping attack due to improper handling of XML element positions within the document tree.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to move XML elements within the document without invalidating the signature. This allows modification of the signed content while the signature remains valid.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to modify the contents of a signed message arbitrarily, effectively bypassing the integrity protection provided by the digital signature.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating XML elements within a signed message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to manipulate the XML message being transmitted.
