Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-10711:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The "user" field in SimpleRisk's user password reset form (`reset.php`) was not properly sanitized or filtered against dangerous user input. The value of the "user" input was echoed directly to the view without any filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the SimpleRisk application.
- This could lead to:
  - Stealing SimpleRisk users' sessions.
  - Performing actions on behalf of SimpleRisk users.
  - Hijacking session cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a POST request to `reset.php`.
- The malicious JavaScript payload is injected through the "user" parameter in the POST request.
- This attack can be delivered via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious POST request targeting the `reset.php` endpoint with the crafted XSS payload in the `user` parameter.
- The attacker would need to induce a user to send the crafted POST request via CSRF, or have the victim access the malicious URL through social engineering.

**Technical details:**

- The vulnerable code resides within the `reset.php` file where the "user" input is directly echoed to the view.
- Vulnerable parameter: `user`
- Example payload: `'"â€“></style></script><script>alert(document.domain)</script>'`
- Version affected: SimpleRisk <= 20170614-001
