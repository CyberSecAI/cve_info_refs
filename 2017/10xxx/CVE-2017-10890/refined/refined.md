- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the session management of the COCOROBO robotic appliance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper session management (CWE-639).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same LAN can impersonate a user, potentially leading to arbitrary operations on the device or alteration/disclosure of information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent network (same LAN).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the vulnerable device and be able to interact with it. User interaction is required, according to the CVSS v3 score.
