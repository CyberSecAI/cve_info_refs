The provided content is a security advisory that includes information about CVE-2017-10668.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The OSCI 1.2 Transport library, used for secure message exchange in German e-government, uses CBC block cipher algorithms (TripleDES and AES variants) without proper protection against modification (malleability). The library reveals whether decryption failed through an error message (error code 9202). This allows an attacker to perform a padding oracle attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Padding oracle vulnerability due to the use of CBC mode encryption without integrity checks and revealing decryption failures through error codes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can bypass transport encryption and decrypt encrypted messages.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker sends manipulated, encrypted messages to the vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send data to a system using the OSCI-Transport library.
*   The attacker needs to be able to observe whether decryption succeeded or failed.
