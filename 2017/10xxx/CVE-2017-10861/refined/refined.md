- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in processing input from an agent program by the administrative server of QND Advance/Standard. This allows for directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability. Additionally, the administrative server does not require authentication for communication with the agent program.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain or alter arbitrary files on the administrative server by sending a specially crafted command.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by sending a malicious request from any device with access to the administrative server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the administrative server to send malicious requests. No authentication is required.
