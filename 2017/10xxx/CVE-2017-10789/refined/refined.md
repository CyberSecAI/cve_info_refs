Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10789:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2017-10789 refers to a vulnerability in the `DBD::mysql` Perl module where setting `mysql_ssl=1` does not actually enforce SSL/TLS encryption, leading to connections being established without encryption when they should be encrypted.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way `DBD::mysql` handled the `mysql_ssl` parameter and the underlying `libmysqlclient.so` library.  The `mysql_ssl=1` setting was not strictly enforcing SSL/TLS, and in some cases, the client would fall back to unencrypted connections if the server did not support it or if the underlying library was vulnerable to "BACKRONYM" or "Riddle" attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of strict enforcement of SSL/TLS encryption when `mysql_ssl=1` is set.
- The module was also susceptible to downgrade attacks because it would connect without encryption even when encryption was requested if the server did not offer it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is a loss of confidentiality. Sensitive data (login credentials, query data) could be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attacker when it should have been encrypted.
- An attacker could passively monitor network traffic between the client and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker positioned on the network path between a `DBD::mysql` client and a MySQL server could eavesdrop on traffic.
- An attacker could potentially use a "man-in-the-middle" approach.
- The attacker does not require any specific access or credentials on either side to perform the downgrade to unencrypted connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server. This implies a network-level attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented involved changing the behavior of `mysql_ssl=1` to enforce encryption. If the library or server does not support SSL/TLS, the client would fail to connect.
- A new parameter, `mysql_ssl_optional=1`, was introduced to allow for the insecure behavior if explicitly set for cases where an encrypted channel is not required, but this behavior was strongly discouraged in documentation.
- The fix also addresses vulnerabilities related to "BACKRONYM" and "Riddle" attacks by enforcing a secure connection.
- The pull request #114 on GitHub contains the fixes that address the issue.
