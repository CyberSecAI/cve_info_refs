Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the IP Messenger installer's insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). Specifically, it's caused by the installer's use of WinAPI calls (like `ShellExecute` and COM interfaces like `IShellLink`) which load DLLs without specifying their absolute paths. This makes the installer vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installer searches for required DLLs in the same directory as the executable and potentially other locations based on the system's search order for DLLs. This allows a malicious user to place a specially crafted DLL with the same name as a DLL the installer tries to load in a location that the installer checks, before the legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in the same directory as the installer executable. When the installer is run, it may load the attacker's DLL instead of the legitimate one. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer executable.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to run the installer after the malicious DLL has been placed in the directory by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Write Files:** The attacker needs the ability to write files to the local file system of the victim, specifically in the same directory as the IP Messenger installer executable.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker may need to trick the user into placing the installer executable in the same folder as the malicious DLL and then running the installer.

**Summary of the Attack:**

1.  The attacker places a malicious DLL file with the same name as a DLL used by the IP Messenger installer in the same directory as the installer executable.
2.  The user executes the installer, and due to the DLL search path issue, the malicious DLL is loaded.
3.  The malicious DLL executes arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only affects the installer and not already installed versions of IP Messenger.
*   The vendor has released an updated installer (v4.61 or later) to fix the issue, which should be used by affected users.
*   The analysis assumes the user is tricked into placing the installer in a folder with the malicious DLL.
*  The vendor confirms that the vulnerability arises from Windows API calls and COM interfaces loading DLLs without absolute paths.
