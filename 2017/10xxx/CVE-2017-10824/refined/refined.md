- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer and self-extracting archive of TDB CA TypeA use software have an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper DLL loading (CWE-427)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installer or the self-extracting archive.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to trick a user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder that is searched by the installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will find it. The user has to execute the installer.
