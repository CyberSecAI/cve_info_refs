Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-10616

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the IFMAP service bundled with Juniper Contrail releases prior to version 4.0. This IFMAP service is packaged from the `irond` project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798):** The core issue is the presence of statically defined, unchanging credentials within the software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers with knowledge of these credentials could gain unauthorized access to the IFMAP service.
- **Information Disclosure:**  As demonstrated in the provided proof of concept related to CVE-2017-10617 (which is linked to this CVE), an attacker could potentially exploit the service further to reveal sensitive information, such as OpenStack admin passwords by exploiting an XXE vulnerability in the same service.
- **Lateral Movement:** The hardcoded credentials could be leveraged to further compromise the network if the service has access to other internal systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network, making it remotely accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the network where the vulnerable Contrail instance is running.
- **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker must know the hard-coded credentials for the IFMAP service.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected versions:** Contrail 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2
- **Patched versions:** 2.2.1.4, 3.0.3.4, 3.1.4.0, 3.2.5.0 and all subsequent releases.
- **Severity:** Moderate with a CVSS score of 5.3.
- **Attack Complexity:** Low
- **Privileges Required:** None
- **User Interaction:** None
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Low
- **Integrity Impact:** None
- **Availability Impact:** None
