- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer of HYPER SBI has an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries. Specifically, it does not properly validate the location from which it loads DLLs, potentially loading them from an untrusted location.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427). The installer is vulnerable to DLL hijacking/planting.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who runs the installer. This means an attacker can gain control over the system and perform malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in a location where the HYPER SBI installer would search for DLLs and then trick the user into running the vulnerable installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to write a file to a location where the installer searches for DLLs. The user also needs to execute the vulnerable installer. The attack requires some form of user interaction and does not work if the user already has the application installed since the vulnerability only affects the installer.
