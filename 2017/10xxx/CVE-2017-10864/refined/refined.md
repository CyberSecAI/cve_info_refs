- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer for HIBUN Confidential File Viewer has an issue with the search path for DLL/executable files. This can lead to insecurely loading dynamic link libraries (DLLs) and invoking executable files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)). The installer does not properly validate the location of DLLs and executables it loads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer searches for libraries and trick a user into running the vulnerable installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a specific folder that the installer searches. The user must then execute the installer.
