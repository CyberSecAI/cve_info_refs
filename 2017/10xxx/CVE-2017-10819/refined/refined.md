- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation in the Relay Service Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The server does not properly validate certificates, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A man-in-the-middle attack may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on encrypted communications.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and server to intercept and modify communications.
