  "CVE-2017-10046": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is present in the Primavera P6 Enterprise Project Portfolio Management component of Oracle Primavera Products Suite, specifically in the Web Access subcomponent. It affects versions 8.3, 8.4, 15.1, 15.2, and 16.1.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application takes user input from the `languageCode` parameter and includes it in the `ORA-PWEB_LANGUAGE_1111` cookie value within the 'Set-Cookie' HTTP Response header without proper sanitization. This allows for the injection of CR (carriage return) and LF (line feed) characters, leading to HTTP Response Splitting.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "HTTP Response Splitting",
        "Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers and body content into the application's response, leading to:\n\t* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.\n\t* Redirection of victims to malicious websites.\n\t* Web and browser cache poisoning.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access via HTTP"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A low-privileged attacker with network access can exploit the vulnerability.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with a specially crafted `languageCode` parameter.",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability is easily exploitable and can significantly impact additional products beyond Primavera P6 Enterprise Project Portfolio Management."
