- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Arbitrary PHP file inclusion through manipulation of a URL parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unvalidated user-controlled input is used to include arbitrary PHP files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute existing PHP files on the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure, although the exploit is limited to existing files as the system doesn't allow direct upload of PHP files.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating a URL parameter in the back end.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in backend user.
