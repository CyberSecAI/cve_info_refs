    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2017-10946",
      "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the setItem function. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object within the `setItem` function.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution.",
      "Attack Vectors": "The attacker needs to lure a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious page or file that exploits the vulnerability.",
        "Required Attacker Position": "Remote"
