{
  "vulnerability": "The LambdaFormEditor class in the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not correctly perform bounds checks in the permuteArgumentsForm() function. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to corrupt JVM memory and cause it to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions.",
  "affected_components": [
    "OpenJDK",
    "Java Development Kit (JDK)",
    "Java Runtime Environment (JRE)",
    "IcedTea"
  ],
  "root_cause": "Incorrect bounds checks in the permuteArgumentsForm() function within the LambdaFormEditor class.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Incorrect bounds checking",
    "Memory corruption vulnerability",
    "Java sandbox bypass"
   ],
  "impact": "A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or gain access to information.",
  "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by utilizing a crafted Java application or applet that calls MethodHandle.permuteArguments()",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to run untrusted Java code.",
  "additional_information": [
     "This vulnerability was also addressed in Oracle's CPU July 2017. Fixed versions include Oracle JDK 8u141",
     "The fix for this issue was added to the package.access security property, which defines the list of restricted internal packages not accessible to untrusted code."
