Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-10818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key** within the MaLion software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The software utilizes a static, pre-defined key for encryption purposes, instead of generating or obtaining it securely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully obtains the hard-coded key can then **spoof a Relay Service** and alter the connection settings of Terminal Agents. This can lead to unauthorized access, control or manipulation of the affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, as the vulnerability is exploited by an attacker impersonating a legitimate Relay Service.
- The attacker would need to obtain the hard-coded key, then act as the relay server to the terminal agent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have knowledge of the hard-coded cryptographic key.
- The attacker needs to be able to position themselves to intercept or otherwise interact with the Terminal Agent as a relay service.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Affected Versions:**
- MaLion for Windows and Mac versions 3.2.1 to 5.2.1 are affected.
