Date: Sep 27 2017
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
Fix Available: Yes Vendor Confirmed: Yes
Version(s): SAP Enterprise Portal 7.50 and prior
Description: A vulnerability was reported in SAP Enterprise Portal (EP) and Clients. A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
The software does not properly filter HTML code from user-supplied input before displaying the input. A remote user can cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the SAP Enterprise Portal (EP) and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.
Impact: A remote user can access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site running the SAP Enterprise Portal, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.
