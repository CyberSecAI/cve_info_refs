  "CVE-2017-10989": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "The getNodeSize function in ext/rtree/rtree.c in SQLite through 3.19.3, as used in GDAL and other products, mishandles undersized RTree blobs in a crafted database, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read or possibly unspecified other impact.",
      "Official_Description": true
    },
    "Root_Cause": "The `getNodeSize` function in the RTree module of SQLite mishandles undersized RTree blobs within a crafted database.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A heap-based buffer over-read, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or unspecified other impacts, was caused by a mishandling of undersized RTree blobs in a crafted database.",
    "Attack_Vectors": [
      "Crafted SQLite database file"
    ],
    "Required_Capabilities": [
      "Ability to create/modify an SQLite database with specific crafted RTree blobs."
    ],
    "Affected_Components": [
      "SQLite library (specifically, the RTree module)"
    ],
    "Vulnerable_Versions": [
      "SQLite versions through 3.19.3"
    ],
