Hello Even, thanks for this. There's a lot of complexity in that patch, and the commit message includes "This is a work in progress". I'm not sure we should just apply this patch ourselves without further interaction with SQLite3 developers.

What constraints are we under via the oss-fuzz or GDAL projects?

Thanks

I agree the patch is complex (I don't understand it, just blindly git bisected and applied it), the commit message doesn't specifically mention addressing database corruption (the fact it fixes the bug seems to be a side-effect) and should be vetted by SQLite3 developers. OSS-Fuzz has a 90 day deadline period (<https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/>), starting yesterday.

Update from our exchanges with Richard Hipp, SQLite3 developper

The issue is hidden in SQLite 3.17.0 or later due to a refactoring in the RTree area. That said, he committed <https://sqlite.org/src/vpatch?from=0db20efe201736b3&to=66de6f4a9504ec26> in SQLite3 master to detect the corruption earlier.

Last message from Richard Hipp:

"""

A proper fix for the problem can be seen at <https://sqlite.org/src/info/66de6f4a>

The change on trunk appears to be defensive code only. I have been

unable to generate any problems after the 3.11.0 optimizations. But

the defensive code has value in that it provides a better error

message, and it should help prevent any future problems.

You only need the patch to rtree.c, of course, not the new test case

in rtreeA.test.

This patch merges cleanly with SQLite version 3.10.2, and probably

most other prior versions. What version of SQLite did you say you are

using? The plain ASCII patch can be seen at

<https://sqlite.org/src/vpatch?from=0db20efe201736b3&to=66de6f4a9504ec26>

Oh that's unfortuate. I didn't say it was fixed in -any- version in

my submission, because it felt to me the 3.17.0 was an accidental

no-longer-triggered case not actually fixed-case. After all, the fix

was checked into a master branch and no new releases appear to have been

tagged afterwards.

Thanks for the sharp eyes. I've submitted a change request.

                 CVE-2017-10989 CVE-2018-8740
Debian Bug     : 867618 893195

Several flaws were corrected in SQLite, an SQL database engine.

CVE-2017-2518

    A use-after-free bug in the query optimizer may cause a
    buffer overflow and application crash via a crafted SQL statement.

CVE-2017-2519

    Insufficient size of the reference count on Table objects
    could lead to a denial-of-service or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2017-2520

    The sqlite3_value_text() interface returned a buffer that was not
    large enough to hold the complete string plus zero terminator when
    the input was a zeroblob. This could lead to arbitrary code
    execution or a denial-of-service.

CVE-2017-10989

    SQLite mishandles undersized RTree blobs in a crafted database
    leading to a heap-based buffer over-read or possibly unspecified
    other impact.

CVE-2018-8740

    Databases whose schema is corrupted using a CREATE TABLE AS
    statement could cause a NULL pointer dereference.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.8.7.1-1+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your sqlite3 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
