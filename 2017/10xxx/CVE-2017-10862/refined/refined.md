Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10862:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `jwt-scala` library fails to properly verify the signatures of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) due to improper processing of JWT headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Signature Verification:** The library doesn't correctly validate JWT signatures, allowing specially crafted tokens to be incorrectly verified.
*  **Improper JWT header processing:** The vulnerability is caused by improper processing of JWT headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization:**  Attackers can forge JWTs with arbitrary payloads and bypass intended access controls. This allows an attacker to impersonate users or gain access to unauthorized resources.
*   **Integrity Violation:** Because the signature verification is bypassed, attackers can modify the contents of the JWT and still have it pass validation which could lead to unwanted changes in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as JWTs are typically transmitted over networks (e.g., in HTTP headers).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious JWT.
* No specific user privileges or interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `jwt-scala` version 1.2.2 and earlier.
*   A patch was applied to the GitHub repository on September 11, 2017.
*   A workaround involves checking that the `alg` field in the JWT header has an appropriate value.
*   The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 and CVSS v2 base score of 5.0.
