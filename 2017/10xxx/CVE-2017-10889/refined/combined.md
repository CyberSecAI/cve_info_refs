Tobias –
For years I used only the free version for a single table on my clients domain. However since upgrading to TablePress PRO I cannot say it enough; I really like the enhancements for this Version 3.0.2 It is so refreshing to be able to use multiple tables throughout the domain and to be able to style them so quickly & easily. I hope to launch the site to production within the next few weeks.
And – your support is second to no one that I have ever work with before.
Great work!

TablePress is a great plugin for managing tables in WordPress. It is easy to use, highly customizable and offers a wide range of functionality for users of all levels. Despite some small limitations, it remains one of the best solutions for managing tables in WordPress.
You can create shortcodes, import data from HTML tables, Excel, Google Sheets. You can customize via CSS and, most importantly, the support is fast and professional.

Wir hatten ein Speicherproblem (Fehler) bei den Tabellen. Support angeschrieben und in wenigen Stunden ein Feedback erhalten. Wir konnten durch den Support ein anderes störendes Plugin recht schnell identifizieren, welches den Fehler verursachte und uns wurde eine zusätzliche Vorablösung an die Hand gegeben, um das Problem, also den Fehler, schnell auch selber nochmal besser zu finden. Wir haben Anweisung bekommen, wie wir den Fehler auch ohne Deaktivierung des störenden Plugins direkt in der Datenbank easy beheben können und durch die schnelle Eingrenzung des Problems gab es keine Ausfälle auf der betroffenen Webseite. Alles gefühlt innerhalb von 24 Stunden. SO schnell und kompetent wurde uns bei anderen Plugin bisher noch nie geholfen. Vielen mega Dank 🙂

The money hungry devs who made this don’t have responsive tables by default. It’s a premium feature. Go use Ninja Tables instead.

I had a strange issue with the plugin which was caused by google auto translate. Tobias responded very quickly and pointed me in the right direction.
Thanks
