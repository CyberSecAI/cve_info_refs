The provided content is related to CVE-2017-10962.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were present due to inadequate handling of user-supplied input. Specifically, the query string of HTTP requests/REDCap links, and text strings used for conversation titles or messages in REDCap Messenger were vulnerable.
-  Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities were present in functions used for deleting files in the File Repository and on File Upload fields due to lack of CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS in HTTP requests/REDCap links.
- XSS in conversation titles and messages in REDCap Messenger.
- CSRF in file deletion functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS could be exploited by malicious users by manipulating the query string of an HTTP request or REDCap link, potentially allowing them to execute malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers.
- XSS in REDCap Messenger could allow malicious users to inject scripts via conversation titles or messages.
- CSRF could allow malicious users to perform unauthorized file deletions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating the query string of an HTTP request or REDCap link.
- Manipulating text strings input into conversation titles or messages in REDCap Messenger.
- Exploiting lack of CSRF protection in file deletion functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests or REDCap links, manipulate text strings input to messenger. The attacker needs to be able to entice a victim into clicking a malicious link, or interacting with malicious content, to execute the XSS or trigger CSRF action.
