Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The installer for "Flets Azukeru for Windows Auto Backup Tool" has a DLL search path issue. This means it doesn't properly specify the directories to search for DLL files when loading them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installer is vulnerable to loading DLLs from untrusted locations due to the flawed DLL search path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer searches and thus execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to have a way to place a malicious DLL in a directory searched by the installer. This usually involves local file system access.
- **User Interaction:** The user must run the vulnerable installer for the malicious DLL to be loaded and executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write files to the system in a location where the installer searches for DLLs.
- The attacker needs to trick or convince the user to run the vulnerable installer.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is specific to the installer and does not affect the application itself after installation.
- The vendor advises users to check for suspicious files in the same directory as the installer before running it.
- The vendor has released a new version of the installer (v1.0.3.1 or later) to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Eili Masami of Tachibana Lab.
