Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-10688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagCheckedLong8Array` function within `tif_dirwrite.c`. This function is responsible for writing directory tags of type `LONG8` in TIFF files.
- The code contains an assertion `assert(tif->tif_flags&TIFF_BIGTIFF);` which checks if the TIFF file is a BigTIFF file before proceeding. If the file isn't a BigTIFF, the assertion fails, causing the program to abort.
- This assertion is incorrectly placed and can be triggered by a crafted TIFF file that doesn't conform to the BigTIFF format, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Assertion Failure:** The core issue is the assertion within `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagCheckedLong8Array` that is too strict and does not account for non-BigTIFF files.
- **Denial of Service:** The assertion failure leads to an abort, which results in a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** A specially crafted TIFF file, when opened or processed by an application using the vulnerable LibTIFF library, will cause the application to crash. This leads to a denial of service condition, making the application unavailable until restarted.
- **No arbitrary code execution:** The provided information suggests a crash due to an assertion failure, not a memory corruption issue that would typically lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious TIFF File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted TIFF file that is not a BigTIFF file but contains `LONG8` tags.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user or automated system into opening/processing this crafted TIFF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious TIFF file.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to somehow get the victim to process the file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of libtiff prior to the fix.
- The fix involves replacing the assertion with a non-fatal error message, which would prevent the program from crashing.
- The vulnerability was discovered by "team OWL337" using their custom fuzzer "collAFL".
- The provided exploit from Exploit-DB shows a clear trigger for the vulnerability, with the program aborting due to the assertion failure at line 2127.
- The bug report from maptools.org confirms that the issue was fixed.
