- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow in the `GetNextToken` function when processing SVG files with malformed or specific structures involving unmatched parentheses within a string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing tokens within a string in an SVG file. Specifically, the code iterates through the input buffer without properly accounting for the end of allocated buffer, causing a read out-of-bounds.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash, denial of service. The content notes the possibility of leaking heap data, or even other application private data. Code execution might also be possible.
- **Attack vectors:** Processing a specially crafted SVG file using `identify` or `convert` commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to provide a crafted SVG file to be processed by ImageMagick.
