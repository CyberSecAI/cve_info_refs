Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The installer for FENCE-Explorer has an issue with its search path when loading Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) and invoking executable files. This means it doesn't properly validate the location of DLLs and executables before loading them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installer may load DLLs from an untrusted location due to the flawed search path. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a malicious DLL is placed in a location searched by the installer.
*   **Insecure Executable Invocation:** Similarly, the installer may invoke untrusted executables from a vulnerable location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the installer. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some access to the system where the vulnerable installer is run.
*   **DLL Hijacking:** The attacker would place a malicious DLL with a name expected by the FENCE-Explorer installer in a location that is searched before the legitimate DLL, or place the malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer before launching it.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to be tricked into running the vulnerable installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to place the malicious DLL/executable.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to run the vulnerable installer.
*   **Understanding of the DLL search path:** The attacker needs to understand the DLL search path used by the installer to place the malicious DLL in the right location.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability resides in the installer, not the application itself.
*   Users who have already installed FENCE-Explorer are not affected by this vulnerability, but only when installing.
*   Users using a portable version of FENCE-Explorer can avoid this vulnerability if they control file placement, however the application still contains a DLL preloading vulnerability if the user is tricked to place a malicious DLL into the directory of the application itself.
*   The provided analysis assumes that a malicious DLL is placed in a specific folder where the application searches for it.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Eili Masami of Tachibana Lab. to IPA.

This analysis provides more detail than the original CVE description, clarifying that the issue is related to insecure DLL loading in the installer and how an attacker can exploit it.
