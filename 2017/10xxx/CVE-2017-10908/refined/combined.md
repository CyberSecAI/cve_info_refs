## Description

[![@kazuho](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41567?v=4&size=48)](/kazuho)[kazuho](https://github.com/kazuho)opened [on Dec 14, 2017](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/1543#issue-282001732)

The server segfaults when trying to emit the bits of a TLS 1.3 cipher-suite being used to the access-log (by specifying `%{ssl.cipher-bits}x`).

To avoid the issue, users are advised to upgrade to version 2.2.4 or to disable the use of TLS 1.3 (by setting the [`maximum-version`](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/base_directives.html#maximum-version%60) to `1.2`).

The issue was reported by [@herumi](https://github.com/herumi) in [#1465](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/1465).

## Description

[![@kazuho](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41567?v=4&size=48)](/kazuho)[kazuho](https://github.com/kazuho)opened [on Dec 14, 2017](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/1544#issue-282002725)

H2O up to version 2.2.3 may segfault when receiving a malformed HTTP/2 request. Users should update to 2.2.4.

Details TBD.

Server configurations that have only one host defined (in the `hosts` mapping) or have every host mapped to a different port is not affected by the issue.

The issue was reported by [@Etsukata](https://github.com/Etsukata).
