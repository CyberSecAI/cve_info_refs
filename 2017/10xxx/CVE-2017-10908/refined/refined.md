**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the way H2O processes HTTP/2 headers. Specifically, malformed HTTP/2 requests can trigger a segfault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed input (HTTP/2 headers).
- Denial of service due to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending a specially crafted, malformed HTTP/2 request, leading to server crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N) and can be triggered remotely over the network.
- The attack vector involves sending a malformed HTTP/2 request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable H2O server.
- No authentication is required (PR:N), meaning any attacker can trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The issue is related to the processing of HTTP/2 headers.
- The fix was released in version 2.2.4
- Server configurations with one host defined or each host mapped to a different port are not affected by this issue.
