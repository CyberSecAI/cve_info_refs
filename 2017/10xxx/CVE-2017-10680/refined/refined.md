Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-10680:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues:
1.  **Incorrect Permissions:** The application allows an attacker to discover private album IDs by brute-forcing and observing server responses.  A 200 response indicates the album is accessible, while a 301 indicates restricted access. The attacker could then access album permalinks by requesting the album ID, which is included in the response packet.
2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application lacks CSRF protection (specifically, the absence of a `pwg_token`) in the `cat_options.php` and `permalinks.php` pages, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions, such as changing album visibility from private to public, deleting permalinks, and unlocking albums, on behalf of an authenticated administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The ability to guess album IDs via brute force and infer access based on server responses.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** Lack of CSRF protection in admin functionalities allows for unauthorized state changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Disclosure of Private Content:** An attacker can discover and access hidden/private albums by guessing album IDs.
*   **Unauthorized Modification of Album Settings:** An attacker can make private albums public, delete permalinks, and unlock albums, affecting the integrity and privacy of the photo gallery.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By gaining access to the admin panel, further vulnerabilities could be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Brute-force Album IDs:** Attackers send requests to `/piwigo/index.php?/category/<album_id>` to check accessibility by observing the HTTP status code.
2.  **CSRF Attack:**  Attackers craft malicious HTML pages that contain forms sending unauthorized requests (e.g., to change album visibility, delete permalinks) to the Piwigo application, targeting logged-in administrators. The forms are submitted when an administrator opens the malicious page in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the Piwigo application and its URL structure.
*   The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests or HTML forms.
*   For the CSRF attack, the attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into opening a malicious webpage while they are logged in.

**Additional details from provided content:**
* The provided content is an issue report and a commit that fixes the vulnerability.
*   The commit addresses the CSRF vulnerability by adding `pwg_token` to the affected forms in `admin/cat_options.php` and `admin/permalinks.php`
*   The vulnerability was discovered by topsec(Li Zhiqiang).
*   The affected version is Piwigo version 2.9.1.
*   The fix was included in version 2.9.2
