Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10685:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `fmt_entry` function of the ncurses tool. This is due to an unbounded `sprintf` operation that copies values related to user-controlled input into a buffer with a fixed size (`MAX_TERMINFO_LENGTH + EXTRA_CAP`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format string vulnerability:** The `sprintf` function in `fmt_entry` is used with user-controlled input, creating a format string vulnerability.
- **Buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` operation writes beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer on the stack, leading to a stack overflow. This occurs because the size of input data is not correctly checked before using `sprintf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overflowing the buffer, the attacker can overwrite the return address of the `fmt_entry` function, allowing them to redirect code execution to an attacker-controlled address. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Crash:** The stack overflow can also cause the program to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted terminfo or other data:** The vulnerability can be triggered by enticing a user to process specially crafted terminfo data.
- **`infotocap` tool:** The provided information explicitly mentions that the `infotocap` tool can be used to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide malicious input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide crafted input (e.g., specially crafted terminfo) to the vulnerable application (e.g., `infotocap`).
- **No special privileges required:** It appears that no special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The Red Hat bug report indicates that this issue is a duplicate of bug 1464687, which describes a similar array out-of-bounds write in `fmt_entry`.
- The vulnerability is reproducible in ncurses versions less than or equal to 6.0.
- The provided Gentoo Security Advisory indicates the affected versions are < 6.1, and the issue was resolved in version 6.1
