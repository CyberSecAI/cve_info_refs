## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Jun 28, 2017](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/17898#issue-239309966)
# Security Advisory (ODOO-SA-2017-06-15-4)

## Remote code execution via Anonymization module

**Affects**: All Odoo versions

**Component**: Database Anonymization module

**Credits**: An independent security researcher "Ayrx" has reported this

vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure

program.

**CVE-ID**: [CVE-2017-10803](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10803)

## I. Background

Odoo includes an optional "Database Anonymization" module that can be

used by administrators to perform a one-shot reversible anonymization

of their database contents. This is typically used to remove all

identifiable names and details from the address book and all documents

in an Odoo database, prior to sending it to Odoo's upgrade systems.

The operation can be reversed later once the database upgrade is

completed.

## II. Problem Description

The serialization system used to store the local data to reverse the

anonymization procedure relies on the "pickle" object serialization

algorithm.

The pickle module of Python is not secure against erroneous or

maliciously constructed data, and in its default configuration, could be

exploited to execute arbitrary Python code.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Privileged user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 8.7 [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

Malicious users with access to an administrator account on an Odoo

database could craft a malicious anonymization data file, and use it to

execute arbitrary Python code.

This would allow them to execute commands with the system privileges of

the Odoo service, possibly accessing local files, local services, etc.

Systems who host Odoo databases for untrusted users are particularly at

risk, (e.g. SaaS platforms), as they typically allow users to become

administrators of their own Odoo database. This is sufficient to exploit

the vulnerability.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any malicious use if this vulnerability.

## IV. Workaround

Administrators of Odoo deployments where untrusted users are allowed to

manage their own Odoo databases (SaaS-like) can make the Database

Anonymization module unavailable by deleting its folder ("anonymization")

from the "addons\_path" directory, and restarting the Odoo relevant service.

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 8.0: [89eca96](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/89eca9647636b1d801cf52aa98d83131b99d48fd)
* 9.0: [e40a4ba](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/e40a4baf41b3b833af37d0086a3251ae52d4ad1b)
* 10.0: [625c0d5](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/625c0d5d8eb2c196ffcb04304a3ec7cfc48027ac)
* 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 9.0 and 10.0.
