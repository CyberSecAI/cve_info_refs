Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) by the "i-filter 6.0 installer". Specifically, the installer has a flaw in its DLL loading mechanism that allows it to load arbitrary DLLs from untrusted locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The core weakness is that the installer does not properly validate the location from where it loads DLLs. This lack of validation allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker could potentially install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** An attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer will attempt to load it. This typically involves leveraging a writable directory where the installer or the user has the permissions to write.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to execute the vulnerable installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system in order to place the malicious DLL.
*   **Social Engineering (Possible):** In some instances, social engineering could be involved to trick the user into executing the vulnerable installer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects the installer specifically. Users who have already installed "i-filter 6.0" are not vulnerable.
*   The vendor provided a patch that addresses this DLL loading issue.
