The provided content is a security advisory that includes information about CVE-2017-10670.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The OSCI-Transport library's XML parser is vulnerable to External Entity Injection (XXE). The parser resolves external entities, allowing for malicious XML data to be crafted by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   External Entity Injection (XXE): The library is vulnerable to XXE attacks due to its XML parser being configured to resolve external entities. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML that can be processed by the library.
*   Deserialization Gadget: The `readObject()` method of a class within the library uses an XML parser configured to resolve external entities which can be exploited through deserialization of attacker controlled data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary File Read: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the file system of the victim host.
*   Denial of Service: An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Manipulated XML Data: By sending manipulated XML data to any communication partner using the vulnerable OSCI-Transport library, an attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability.
*   Deserialization of malicious data: if the vulnerable library is included in the classpath of an application and the application deserializes attacker-controlled data, an attacker can also exploit the XXE vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send manipulated XML data to a system that uses the vulnerable OSCI-Transport library.
* For the deserialization attack, the attacker must have the ability to influence data that an application deserializes.
