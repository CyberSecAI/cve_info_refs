  "CVE-2017-10985": {
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the FreeRADIUS server to enter an infinite loop, consume increasing amounts of memory resources, and ultimately crash by sending a specially crafted request packet.",
    "root_cause": "The server receives zero-length attributes marked as 'concat' in the dictionaries, which causes an infinite loop due to incorrect handling of the attribute length.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Infinite loop",
      "Memory exhaustion"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to infinite loop and memory exhaustion leading to server crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted RADIUS request packet with zero-length attributes marked as 'concat' to the server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send packets that are accepted by the FreeRADIUS server.",
        "additional_details": "The issue occurs when handling attributes with specific data patterns such as 4f 02, 89 02, 90 02, or b4 02. The vulnerability is present in FreeRADIUS versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.14."
