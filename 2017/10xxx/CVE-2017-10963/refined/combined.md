|  | In Samsung Knox SDS IAM & EMM 16.11 on Samsung mobile devices, a man-in-the-middle attacker can install |
| --- | --- |
|  | any application into the user's Knox container (without the user's knowledge), by inspecting network |
|  | traffic coming from a Samsung server and injecting specifically crafted content at a certain point in an update sequence. |
|  | This installed application can further leak information stored inside the Knox container to |
|  | the outside world. |
|  |  |
|  | The research discovered a specific exploitation method. Issue has already been confirmed |
|  | and patched by Samsung. The vulnerability was discovered by cyber security researcher Samuel Siino. |
