- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installer for "Flets Install Tool" has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries. This is a classic DLL hijacking vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper DLL search path (CWE-427). The application does not specify the correct path to its required DLL files, allowing a malicious DLL to be loaded instead.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** Local. An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL with the same name as one the installer is trying to load, into a folder that is checked by the DLL search order, before the correct folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have write access to a location searched before the legitimate location and must trick the user into running the installer. The user must run the installer.
