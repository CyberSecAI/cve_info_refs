Subject: CVE request: sthttpd remote heap buffer overflow

Hello,

sthttpd [1], is a fork of thttpd, a small, fast, multiplexing webserver.
Our fuzzing tools recently found a heap buffer overflow in the request
parsing code that can be triggered remotely. The patch was recently fixed
[2], and the bug was introduced in [3].  It seems that it's also affecting
thttpd 2.25b present in OpenSUSE [4].

Let us know if you need more information.

Thanks
Alex from ForAllSecure
