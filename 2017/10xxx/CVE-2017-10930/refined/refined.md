- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - **Improper Access Control:** The affected ZXR10 devices incorrectly restrict access to resources, allowing unauthorized users to download configuration files.
    - **Path Traversal:** The affected devices do not properly restrict the file directory range for web users, which allows them to download arbitrary files.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper access control
    - Path traversal

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Improper Access Control:** Attackers can download configuration files containing sensitive information such as administrator accounts and passwords.
    - **Path Traversal:** Attackers can download any file on the system, leading to information leaks, including system configuration data.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network access (AV:N)
    - Web interface

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - No special privileges or user interaction is required (PR:N/UI:N)
    - Attacker needs network access to the device.
