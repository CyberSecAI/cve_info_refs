Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-10790:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference in the `_asn1_check_identifier` function within the Libtasn1 library. This occurs when a NULL value is assigned to the `value` member of an `asn1_node` structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer when processing ASN.1 structures, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash applications using the Libtasn1 library by providing crafted ASN.1 data, rendering the application unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted ASN.1 Input:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted ASN.1 data that triggers the NULL pointer dereference. This data could be supplied through various means depending on the application (e.g., files, network communication)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted data to a vulnerable service.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted ASN.1 data to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `_asn1_check_identifier` function.
- The crash occurs when the `strlen()` function is called on a NULL `src` pointer during `_asn1_str_cat`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of libtasn1 prior to 4.12

**Affected Versions:**
- libtasn1 versions prior to 4.12.
- Debian 8 "Jessie" versions prior to 4.2-3+deb8u4.
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS versions prior to 3.4-3ubuntu0.6

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to the patched versions of the `libtasn1-6` package

The provided information also includes details about how different distributions addressed the vulnerability:

- **Debian:** Fixed in version `4.2-3+deb8u4` for Debian 8 "Jessie" and `4.10-1.1+deb9u1` for the stable distribution (stretch)
- **Ubuntu:** Fixed in version `3.4-3ubuntu0.6` for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and `4.7-3ubuntu0.16.04.3` for Ubuntu 16.04.
