{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the `lib/puppet/module_tool/tar/mini.rb` file of the Puppet software. When unpacking tarballs using minitar, files are extracted with the same permissions as they had in the archive. This can lead to files being created with insecure permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure permissions when unpacking tarballs."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local user could craft a malicious tarball with files that have insecure permissions, and then get puppet to extract the files using its vulnerable component, leading to code execution.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local user access to the system where puppet is running."
  }
