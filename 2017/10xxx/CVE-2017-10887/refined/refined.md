Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10887:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The installer of "BOOK WALKER for Windows" is vulnerable to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DLL preloading vulnerability (CWE-427). This occurs when the application loads DLLs from an insecure path, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the user invoking the installer. This means an attacker can execute malicious code with the same permissions as the user running the installer.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker places a malicious DLL file in a specific folder where the application looks for DLLs during the installer execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same folder from where the installer is executed. This could be a local folder or network share accessible to the user.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into running the installer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information comes from both a vulnerability advisory from JVN and the vendor's advisory.
- The vendor also indicates this vulnerability is only present in Windows versions of the application prior to version 1.2.10.
