Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the Yaws web server's improper handling of directory traversal sequences, specifically the use of `../` in URL requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote File Disclosure:** The server does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied paths in HTTP requests. This allows an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive File Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server that the web server process has access to, including sensitive files such as:
    *   SSL private keys (`yaws-key.pem`).
    *   Access logs (`localhost.8080.access`).
    *   Potentially other configuration files or application data depending on the server's file system.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exposure of SSL private keys could allow for man-in-the-middle attacks, decryption of encrypted traffic, and impersonation of the server. Disclosure of access logs could leak information about user activity and application behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers send a crafted GET request to the Yaws server containing directory traversal sequences in the URL path. For instance: `http://REMOTE-VICTIM-IP:8080/%5C../ssl/yaws-key.pem` or `http://REMOTE-VICTIM-IP:8080/%5C../logs/localhost.8080.access` .

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Yaws web server on the target network. This could be from the same network as the server or from a remote location if the server is exposed to the internet.
*  **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or knowledge of credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit-db entry confirms that Yaws version 1.91 is vulnerable.
* The provided exploit examples use URL encoded backslashes (`%5C`) in addition to the `../` to perform the traversal.
* The vendor was notified on June 26, 2017, with no response before public disclosure on July 7, 2017.
