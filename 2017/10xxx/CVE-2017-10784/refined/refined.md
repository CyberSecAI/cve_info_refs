Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-10784 found in the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The WEBrick library in Ruby did not properly sanitize all log messages, specifically within its Basic authentication implementation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Escape sequence injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary escape sequences into the WEBrick log via the username field during basic authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Terminal control:**  If the logs are printed in a terminal, an attacker can use injected escape sequences to potentially control the victim's terminal emulator, possibly executing arbitrary commands or changing the terminal output.
*   Denial of Service: While not explicitly stated, this is a potential result of terminal manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious client sends an HTTP request to a server using WEBrick basic authentication.
*   The client crafts the username in the basic authentication header to include escape sequences.
*   WEBrick logs the provided username without sanitization.
*   If the server logs are viewed in a terminal, the injected escape sequences are processed by the terminal, potentially causing harm to the viewer's system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to a server using WEBrick's Basic authentication.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability lies in the processing of the unauthenticated username value.
* The attacker does not need to have any special network access.
*  The attacker needs to target a victim who views the logs.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to an older escape sequence injection vulnerability in WEBrick that was previously fixed, however the fix was not applied to the Basic authentication mechanism
*   Several Red Hat products were affected by this vulnerability, including multiple versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Software Collections.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in multiple Ruby versions.

This vulnerability is specifically an injection vulnerability, that could lead to local terminal manipulation by an attacker that does not require any authentication to exploit.
