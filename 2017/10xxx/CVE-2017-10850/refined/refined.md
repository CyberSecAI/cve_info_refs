Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-10850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an insecure DLL search path used by the installers of multiple Fuji Xerox products. This vulnerability stems from the way the installer attempts to load dynamic link libraries (DLLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installers do not properly validate the location from which DLLs are loaded. This can lead to the loading of malicious DLLs if they are placed in locations searched by the installer before the intended system directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer.
*   **Administrative Privileges:** Since the installer usually requires administrative privileges, an attacker can gain elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched by the vulnerable installer before the legitimate DLL location. This typically involves local file system manipulation.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to run the vulnerable installer while the malicious DLL is present in the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the target system to place the malicious DLL file.
*   **Social Engineering/User Interaction:** The attacker would need to convince or trick a user into running the vulnerable installer, typically with administrator privileges, while the malicious DLL is present in the system.
*   **Malicious DLL Creation:** The attacker must create a malicious DLL that mimics the name of a DLL expected by the vulnerable installer.
