{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `decode_tlv()` function in FreeRADIUS did not properly handle memory allocation when processing DHCP packets with multiple sub-options, leading to a memory leak.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory Leak"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause the FreeRADIUS server to consume an increasing amount of memory resources over time, potentially leading to a crash due to memory exhaustion.",
  "Attack vectors": "Any network device capable of sending DHCP packets to FreeRADIUS can exploit this vulnerability by sending DHCP option 82 with multiple sub-options.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the FreeRADIUS server."
