# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 09:07:02 UTC  ``` It was discovered that if option decoding fails, the fr_dhcp_decode() function would leak memory.  The security impact is denial of service via memory exhaustion by any network device capable of sending DHCP packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.  Affected versions: 2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 09:07:09 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the FreeRADIUS project Upstream: Guido Vranken   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 12:13:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1295278](attachment.cgi?id=1295278&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1295278&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c6)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-07-17 14:33:45 UTC  ``` Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1471853](show_bug.cgi?id=1471853 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-10981 freeradius: Memory leak in fr_dhcp_decode() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-07-18 03:42:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:1759 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1759](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1759)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1468495#c8)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-08-02 09:47:04 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://freeradius.org/security/fuzzer-2017.html>   ``` |  |

Package        : freeradius
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-10978 CVE-2017-10979 CVE-2017-10980 CVE-2017-10981
                 CVE-2017-10982 CVE-2017-10983 CVE-2017-10984 CVE-2017-10985
                 CVE-2017-10986 CVE-2017-10987
Debian Bug     : 868765

Guido Vranken discovered that FreeRADIUS, an open source
implementation of RADIUS, the IETF protocol for AAA (Authorisation,
Authentication, and Accounting), did not properly handle memory when
processing packets. This would allow a remote attacker to cause a
denial-of-service by application crash, or potentially execute
arbitrary code.

All those issues are covered by this single DSA, but it's worth noting
that not all issues affect all releases:

  - CVE-2017-10978 and CVE-2017-10983 affect both jessie and stretch

  - CVE-2017-10979, CVE-2017-10980, CVE-2017-10981 and CVE-2017-10982
    affect only jessie

  - CVE-2017-10984, CVE-2017-10985, CVE-2017-10986 and CVE-2017-10987
    affect only stretch.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.5+dfsg-0.2+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.12+dfsg-5+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your freeradius packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1468490#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 08:56:37 UTC  ``` The rad_coalesce() function checks for WiMAX attributes which are too small, but it does not check for WiMAX attributes which are too large. As a result, the server can be convinced to read past the end of an attribute, and to write past the end of memory allocated via malloc().  The data being copied is taken from the attributes following the malformed WiMAX attribute, and is under the control of the attacker. While the packet has to be a "well formed" RADIUS packet, that requirement limits only the two octets which immediately follow the malformed WiMAX attribute. After that, there are up to 245 octets copied which are the complete control of the attacker.  The issue happens when the server receives any packet containing malformed WiMAX attributes, potentially leading to remote code execution.  Affected versions: 2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1468490#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 08:56:45 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the FreeRADIUS project Upstream: Guido Vranken   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1468490#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-07 12:15:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1295281](attachment.cgi?id=1295281&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1295281&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1468490#c6)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-07-17 14:31:14 UTC  ``` Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1471850](show_bug.cgi?id=1471850 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-10979 freeradius: Out-of-bounds write in rad_coalesce() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1468490#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-07-18 03:42:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:1759 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1759](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1759)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1468490#c8)  Dhiru Kholia    2017-08-02 09:43:07 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://freeradius.org/security/fuzzer-2017.html>   ``` |  |

# Issues found via fuzzing by Guido Vranken

In June 2017, [Guido
Vranken](https://guidovranken.wordpress.com/) found a number of issues with OpenVPN. One issue was a
slow memory leak due to mis-use of the OpenSSL API. He contacted us
to say that FreeRADIUS had the same issue as OpenVPN.
We [fixed](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/c7f120e8c16841e45656ee9e8175e0b3302c1b1e)
that issue immediately in the
the [v2.x.x](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commits/v2.x.x)
branch, and also
[fixed](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/e2c80d363778c1c63461cc15bd509b1122982509)
it in
the [v3.0.x](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commits/v3.0.x)
branch, and the v4.0.x branch. The v3.1.x branch is unsupported, and
has been deleted. Similarly, we do not discuss the v0 or v1 releases,
as those are end of life and unsupported.

In order to improve the security of FreeRADIUS, we asked Guido to try
fuzzing FreeRADIUS. He spent a week working with us, and managed to
find a number of issues. We worked together to create and validate
fixes for all of them.
His [blog](https://guidovranken.wordpress.com/2017/07/17/11-remote-vulnerabilities-inc-2x-rce-in-freeradius-packet-parsers/)
contains a short note on the subject.

The short summary is that if your RADIUS server is on a private
network, accessible only by managed devices, you are likely safe. If
your RADIUS server is part of a roaming consortium, then anyone within
that consortium can attack it. If your RADIUS server is on the public
internet, then you are not following best practices, and anyone on the
net can attack your systems.

## Secure coding in C

Given the scope of these issues, there needs to be a statement on
the security aspects of coding in C. In short, C is a terrible
language for security. We have understood this for many years, and
have taken pro-active steps to deal with the limitations of C. For
example, we worked with Coverity as far back
as [2007](https://www.cnet.com/news/open-source-bug-hunt-project-expands/)
to scan FreeRADIUS.

Starting from version 3, all versions of the server have built with
zero compiler warnings. All releases have passed static analyis
by [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/), [Clang
analyzer](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/),
and [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/). We have
also
used [PVS-Studio](https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/),
with [results here](pvs-studio.html). Each
static analysis tool has it's pros and cons, and each one usually
finds things which are missed by all of the others.

We also have hundreds of regression tests, which check that "well
formed" attributes and packets are decoded correctly, and that
"malformed" attributes and packets do not cause misbehavior in the
server.

As is apparent from this page, those processes are not enough to
ensure secure C code. In short:

*There are about as many issues disclosed in this page as in the previous ten
years combined.*

We will therefore be integrating the fuzzer into all future releases
of the server. We will be updating our automated build system to run
with memory sanitizers enabled. We **strongly recommend** that
other software projects follow the same practices.

**If multiple static analyers and hundreds of regression tests are not
enough for us to find these security issues, they are probably not
enough for you, either.**

## Summary of Issues

This page summarizes his findings, along with our response,
analysis, and fixes. The items are labeled *FR-GV-###*,
followed by which version(s) of the server are affected (v2, v3,
etc.), and finally by a short description. His work led us to do
additional tests, which found other issues that are
labeled *FR-AD-###*.

The issues below were found via fuzzing and address sanitization
checks. Not all are exploitable. Out of 15 issues, 5 have no
possible exploit. Six (6) issues are only for DHCP, leaving 4 for RADIUS.

[FR-AD-003 (v3) Incorrect statement length passed into sqlite3\_prepare](#FR-AD-003)

For some issues, the same or similar code appears in all versions of
FreeRADIUS. i.e. from version 2, to version 3, and the "in
development" v4.0.x branch. As a result, we present the findings by
issue, and state which versions are affected. Where issues only apply
one version, we show them for version 2, and then version 3. We do
not discuss the v4.0.x branch here, as it has not had an official
release. Finally, these issues affect all releases of FreeRADIUS
version 2 and 3.

On July 17 2017, we will release versions 2.2.10 and 3.0.15 in
order to address these issues. Guido has provided us with the source
for the fuzzers. The fuzzers will be integrated into future releases
of FreeRADIUS.

## RADIUS Security

Before we discuss the issues, we must first give the reader some
background on RADIUS security and associated best practices.

In general, RADIUS security can only be described as "poor". The
protocol was designed in 1993, and uses MD5 to sign packets with a
"shared secret". While MD5 has been broken, no one has shown that the
attacks on MD5 can be extended to attack RADIUS. That is, packets
which are signed with the shared secret are considered to be sent from
a "trusted" source.

The design of RADIUS ensures that all packets except Access-Request
are signed. In FreeRADIUS, this signature is checked prior to any
packet decoding. This check ensures that only packets from "trusted"
sources are accepted by the server. In most cases, therefore, only
packets from those "trusted" sources can exploit these issues.

While the Access-Request packets are not signed by default, RADIUS
provides for a signature via the Message-Authenticator attribute.
Again, packets signed via this method are from "trusted" sources, and
only those sources can exploit these issues.

However, many NAS implementations do not send a
Message-Authenticator attribute in Access-Request packets. In those
situations, any attacker who can forge packets from the NAS to the
RADIUS server can have those packets accepted by the server, and can
exploit these issues.

This security issue in RADIUS has been known for over a
decade. [RFC
5080 Section 2.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5080#section-2.2.2) says in part:

However, Access-Request packets not containing a Message-

We **strongly** recommend that vendors update their firmware to
include a Message-Authenticator attribute in all Access-Request
packets. Where this change is not possible, we **strongly**
recommend that all RADIUS administrators ensure that RADIUS traffic is
on a secure management network. That is, end users **should not**
be able to send any network traffic to a RADIUS server.

All versions of FreeRADIUS from version 2.0.0 onwards have provided
for a per-client
configuration `require_message_authenticator`. This flag
rejects all Access-Request packets which do not contain a valid
Message-Authenticator attribute. We recommend that this flag be
enabled where possible. Once this flag is set, even in old an
un-patched versions of the server, the issues discussed here can only
be exploited by "trusted" sources. Also, as of version 2.1.3,
FreeRADIUS has ensured that proxied Access-Request packets always
contain a Message-Authenticator attribute. This change ensures that
all systems which receive Access-Request packets from a FreeRADIUS
proxy can set the `require_message_authenticator` flag.

While this limitation minimizes the impact of these issues, it does
not remove it entirely. Roaming agreements may provide for packets to
be sent from parties who are largely unknown to the recipient, but who
are within a "trusted" roaming coalition. We believe that breaches of
trust by "trusted" parties are best dealt with via administrative
means, and not technical ones. Still, we should still ensure that
trusted parties are unable to exploit our trust in order to perform
malicious actions.

Where is necessary to be part of a roaming consortium, administrators
should ensure that all RADIUS traffic over the public Internet is
encrypted with IPSec or TLS. We *do not* recommend placing a
RADIUS server on the public net. **Even independent of the issues
disclosed here, the security of the RADIUS protocol is insufficient to
guarantee safe operation on the public Internet.**

## DHCP Security

Finally, we note that the discussion above is about RADIUS security,
and does not apply to DHCP. Unfortunately, DHCP protocol security can
best be described as "in practice, non-existent". Unlike RADIUS, DHCP
allows end users to send packets directly to DHCP servers. This
capability means that it is harder for administrators to shield their
DHCP servers from malicious parties.

We note that while FreeRADIUS includes DHCP functionality, it is not
enabled by default. Administrators must take explicit action to
configure it. As such, most FreeRADIUS sites are not vulnerable to
the DHCP issues disclosed here. We still, however, recommend
upgrading to a version which contains fixes for these issues.

# Issues

The follow list describes each issue in detail. Included in each
description are a statement in impact, exploit vector (where
appropriate), a link to the fix, which versions are affected, and
where appropriate, a CVE identifier.

---

## FR-GV-201 (v2,v3) Read / write overflow in make\_secret()

**Issue:**  The `make_secret()` function does not
properly check for output buffer size before writing data. It can
perform a read or write overflow of up to 16 octets.

**Impact:**  Minimal. The issue will be see when the server is
sending a RADIUS packet that is almost at the maximum (4K octets), and
the last attribute in the packet is an Ascend-Send-Secret (or similar)
attribute. The data being written is an MD5 digest of the shared
secret, concatenated to data which is under the attackers control.

The issue will also be seen when receiving a packet that has an
Ascend-Send-Secret (or similar) attribute of the wrong size. The
server will read data past the end of the attribute, up to a limit of
16 octets.

**Exploit vector:**  Read or write overflow, by anyone who can
send packets which are accepted by the server.

Home servers which send large Access-Accept responses, with an
Ascend-Send-Secret attribute as the last one in the packet, and where
the proxy does minimal packet editing, *may* be able crash a
proxy which receives that Access-Accept and forwards it to a NAS.

**Fix:**  Ensure that the `make_secret()` function
checks for bounds on the encapsulating packet. Fixed in
[FR-GV-201
(v2)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/38ee90f2a5a28dc5887a30bdfdc98109c0418e68), and
in [FR-GV-201
(v3)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/fc8662d7e827f630d515eaa0bddfa94754c8047f).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10978](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10978). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-202 (v2) Read overflow in rad\_coalesce

**Issue:**  The `rad_coalesce()` function checks for
WiMAX attributes which are too small, but it does not check for WiMAX
attributes which are too large. As a result, the server can be
convinced to read past the end of an attribute, which may overflow the
heap, leading to a crash.

If the heap does not overflow, the only side-effect is the creation of
a WiMAX attribute with "too much" data. The extra data is copied from
the memory which is past the end of the attribute. That data is under
control of an attacker, as with all other data in the forged packet.
There do not appear to be any side-effects of using this bad data.

*Earlier versions of this page suggested there was a write overflow
vulnerability. Additional investigation showed this to be wrong.*

This issue does not appear in version 3, as that code was re-written,
and the `rad_coalesce` function does not exist in those
branches. However, similar issues appear in
the `data2vp_wimax()` function in version 3.

**Impact:**  Write overflow, possibly remote exploit by anyone
who can send packets which are accepted by the server.

**Exploit vector:**  The issue happens when the server receives
any packet containing malformed WiMAX attributes. One example of this
issue is the following data: `1a 0a 00 00 60 b5 2c 04 80 00 1a 09
00 00 60 b5 2c fa 00`. Similar formats can be used with other
WiMAX attributes, e.g. where the `2c` octet is replace by
other values. The exploit here is the `fa`. That octet
indicates that there are 250 octets of data remaining in the
attribute, while in fact there is only one octet.

**Fix:**  Check for attributes which are "too long", in addition
to checking for attributes which are "too short". Fixed in [FR-GV-202](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ae3ba0011e7d299e92c45300e0137a56a650e8f5).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10979](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10979). Remote code
execution is not possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-203 (v2) DHCP - Memory leak in decode\_tlv()

**Issue: the `decode_tlv()` function leaked memory in certain circumstances.**

**Impact:**  Memory leak, potentially leading to memory
exhaustion.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends option 82 with multiple sub-options.

**Fix:**  Link all decoded attributes into the decoded packet. Fixed in [FR-GV-203](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ef0727fc68e211a36637b5c4e4a6fa1326f0a029).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10980](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10980). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-204 (v2) DHCP - Memory leak in fr\_dhcp\_decode()

**Issue:**  If option decoding fails,
the `fr_dhcp_decode()` function would leak memory.

**Impact:**  Memory leak, potentially leading to memory
exhaustion.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.

**Fix:**  Free partially decoded options on error. Fixed in
[FR-GV-204](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/812766e2150faa07b4c574e51393b014feaffe6c)

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10981](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10981). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-205 (v2) DHCP - Read overflow in fr\_dhcp\_decode\_options()

**Issue:**  The `fr_dhcp_decode_options()` function
does not do proper bounds checks on option lengths, leading to out of
bounds reads.

**Impact:**  The server can read up to 253 octets more data than
it should. Depending on memory layout, this read may initiate a page
fault, and cause the server to crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.

**Fix:**  Check for options which are "too long", in addition
to checking for attributes which are "too short". Fixed in [FR-GV-205](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/10b6de9345c9e0d9d4d5e0426fa5c3d68d702875).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10982](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10982). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-206 (v2,v3) DHCP - Read overflow when decoding option 63

**Issue:**  The `fr_dhcp_decode()` function performed
a `strcmp()` on binary data in an internal data structure,
instead of checking the length of the option and doing
a `memcmp`.

**Impact:**  The server can read memory until it reaches a
zero byte. Depending on memory layout, this read may initiate a page
fault, and cause the server to crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends a DHCP option 63 with non-zero
contents.

**Fix:**  Examine option 60, instead of option 63, and check for option length. Fixed in [FR-GV-206 (v2)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ec08b30f87066f82073d02fab57e8ffeef81373d), and [FR-GV-206 (v3)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/5759b20af99af6d30924f0efd8da5eac2a17163d).

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10983](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10983). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-207 (v2) Zero-length malloc() in data2vp()

**Issue:**  When decoding attributes of type "tlv", the decoder
can call `malloc()` with an argument of zero.

**Impact:**  None. The length of the allocated data is kept
separately in the `vp->length` field. All dereferences to
the allocated data are protected by a check for `vp->length >
0`

**Exploit vector:**  None.

**Fix:**  For general safety, the function was changed to avoid
a zero-length `malloc()`. Fixed in [FR-GV-207](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/26be8a680d2a6830e7be98bee10818dd8b6a426a)

**Affected versions:**  2.0.0 through 2.2.9, inclusive.

**CVE:**  No CVE has been release as this issue has no impact,
and exploitation does not cross a privilege boundary in a correct and
realistic product deployment.

---

## FR-GV-301 (v3) Write overflow in data2vp\_wimax()

**Issue:**  This issue is similar
to [FR-GV-202](#FR-GV-202), as the code in v3 is based on
the code in v2. However, as the issue is slightly different, it is
listed separately.

**Impact:**  Write overflow, possibly remote exploit by anyone
who can send packets which are accepted by the server.

**Exploit vector:**  Sending WiMAX attributes which have the
"continuation" flag set, but for which there is no subsequent data.

**Fix:**  Update checks for malformed attributes. Fixed
in [FR-GV-301](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/931850e5d2f65193520c2d9c9878148c0cdc16a6),
with a related patch
in [another
patch](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/4b059296e14b6ab75dc17163077490528a819806).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10984](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10984). Remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-302 (v3) Infinite loop and memory exhaustion with 'concat' attributes

**Issue:**  When the server receives zero-length attributes
marked 'concat' in the dictionaries, it could go into an infinite loop
and exhaust memory.

**Impact:**  Infinite loop and memory exhaustion, by anyone
who can send packets which are accepted by the server.

**Exploit vector:**  The issue happens when the server receives
a packet containing the following attribute data: `4f
02`, `89 02`, `90 02`, or `b4
02`.

**Fix:**  Update `decode_concat()` function to return
the bytes read from the packet, not the length of the attribute data. Fixed in [FR-GV-302](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/6726c16549b131ed39f6f8886cdf5d9d922a9a97).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10985](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10985). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-303 (v3) DHCP - Infinite read in dhcp\_attr2vp()

**Issue:**  When decoding "string" options in an
array, `dhcp_attr2vp()` could be convinced to
call `memchr()` with a length argument of `-1`.
This could result in an over-read until the first zero octet was
found, or a page fault occured.

**Impact:**  Possible infinite read overflow, or crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends string options to the server in an
option array.

**Fix:**  Perform better bounds checking on decoding string
options in an array. Fixed
in [FR-GV-303](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/21e2e95751bfb54c0fb0328392d06671a75c191c).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10986](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10986). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-304 (v3) DHCP - Buffer over-read in fr\_dhcp\_decode\_suboptions()

**Issue:**  The `fr_dhcp_decode_suboptions()`
function does not properly check if sub-options overflow the packet.

This issue is similar to [FR-GV-205](#FR-GV-205), as the
code in v3 is based on the code in v2. However, as the issue is
slightly different, it is listed separately.

**Impact:**  The server can read up to a small number of octets
more data than it should. Depending on memory layout, this read may
initiate a page fault, and cause the server to crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Any network device capable of sending DHCP
packets to FreeRADIUS, which sends packets with malformed options.

**Fix:**  Check for options which are "too long", in addition
to checking for attributes which are "too short". Fixed in [FR-GV-304](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/19a18bf7c8af649c9e9742fb6a046f6aff639866).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  This issue has been assigned [CVE-2017-10987](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10987). No remote code
execution is possible. A denial of service is possible.

---

## FR-GV-305 (v3) Decode 'signed' attributes correctly

**Issue:**  Attributes of data type 'signed' would sometimes be
created from uninitialized memory, instead of from the received packet.

**Impact:**  Minimal. No overflow or exploit is possible.
Instead, the attribute sometimes has a garbage value. There is only
one 'signed' attribute, which is in the WiMAX dictionaries, and it is
used only in certain limited situations.

**Exploit vector:**  None.

**Fix:**  Decode the attribute correctly. Fixed
in [FR-GV-305](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/de3b3b2e4153db26442facbd5e9b268a3bf795ba).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  None.
No remote code execution is possible. No denial of service is
possible. Exploitation does not cross a privilege boundary in a
correct and realistic product deployment.

---

## FR-AD-001 (v2,v3) Use strncmp() instead of memcmp() for string data

**Issue:**  When reading data from configuration files, the
server could over-read to to 4 octets of data.

**Impact:**  Minimal.

**Exploit vector:**  Administrators who have write access to the
server configuration files.

**Fix:**  Use `strncmp()` instead
of `memcmp()` for bounded comparisons on C strings. Fixed in [FR-AD-001 (v2)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/30c9f53f85a9d07f5213789ea9efbd06d6fc67d8), and
in [FR-AD-001 (v3)](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/41dfe9f0ca550ceb5f152ba8baf03fd6222d7119).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

---

## FR-AD-002 (v3) String lifetime issues in rlm\_python

**Issue:**  The `PySys_SetPath()`
and `PySys_SetName()` functions require a long-lived
pointer to the path / name.

**Impact:**  Potential crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Administrators who have write access to the
server configuration files.

**Fix:**  Use a long-lived string instead of a short-lived one. Fixed in [FR-AD-002](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/a1eccee1872b4019e98e399f0f4597a41ef057a7).

**CVE:**  No CVE has been release as this issue has no impact,
and exploitation does not cross a privilege boundary in a correct and

## FR-AD-003 (v3) Incorrect statement length passed into sqlite3\_prepare

**Issue:**

An incorrect statement length was passed into the `sqlite3_prepare()` function.

**Impact:**  Potential crash.

**Exploit vector:**  Administrators who have write access to the
server configuration files.

**Fix:**  Use the correct statement length. Fixed in [FR-AD-003](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/62f7d2885ad02911f0ae71e7864d4805a489137b).

**Affected versions:**  3.0.0 through 3.0.14, inclusive.

**CVE:**  No CVE has been release as this issue has no impact,
and exploitation does not cross a privilege boundary in a correct and
realistic product deployment.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1759)

## Topic

An update for freeradius is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable free Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server, designed to allow centralized authentication and authorization for a network.

Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled certain attributes in request packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server or to execute arbitrary code in the context of the FreeRADIUS server process by sending a specially crafted request packet. (CVE-2017-10979)
* An out-of-bounds read and write flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled RADIUS packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted RADIUS packet. (CVE-2017-10978)
* Multiple memory leak flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause the FreeRADIUS server to consume an increasing amount of memory resources over time, possibly leading to a crash due to memory exhaustion, by sending specially crafted DHCP packets. (CVE-2017-10980, CVE-2017-10981)
* Multiple out-of-bounds read flaws were found in the way FreeRADIUS server handled decoding of DHCP packets. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash the FreeRADIUS server by sending a specially crafted DHCP request. (CVE-2017-10982, CVE-2017-10983)

Red Hat would like to thank the FreeRADIUS project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of these issues.
