The content is related to CVE-2017-10796.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The TP-LINK NC250 IP camera does not properly enforce access control when streaming video and audio via RTSP, failing to check for password authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The camera allows access to the video and audio stream via RTSP without requiring the correct password, even after the default password has been changed.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view the camera's live video and audio feed without authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the camera (either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
*   **RTSP stream access:** The attacker must use an RTSP client such as VLC to access the camera's feed by supplying the IP address of the camera in the URL format: `rtsp://admin@<yourip>:554/h264_hd.sdp`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the affected camera.
*   The attacker must have access to a device capable of opening an RTSP stream, such as a computer with VLC installed.
