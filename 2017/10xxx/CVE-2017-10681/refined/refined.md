Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2017-10681.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of two weaknesses:
1.  **Lack of proper access control:**  Private albums' existence and their permalinks can be discovered through brute-force techniques, bypassing the intended privacy settings.
2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Administrative actions, such as changing album status (private/public), deleting permalinks, and unlocking albums, lack CSRF protection through `pwg_token`. This allows an attacker to perform these actions on behalf of an authenticated administrator without their knowledge or consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Information Disclosure:** The ability to discover private album IDs and permalinks through brute-force exposes information that should be kept private.
2. **CSRF Vulnerability:** The absence of CSRF tokens on key administrative functions (changing album status, deleting permalinks, unlocking albums) allows for unauthorized state changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can:
1.  **Expose private albums:** By setting the status of private albums to public, attackers can make them visible to all users.
2.  **Manipulate permalinks:** Delete existing permalinks of albums.
3.  **Unlock albums:** Change the state of locked albums.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Brute-force:** Attackers can brute-force album IDs by making requests to URLs like `/piwigo/index.php?/category/<album_id>`.
2. **CSRF:** Attackers can craft malicious HTML pages that, when loaded by an authenticated administrator, perform unauthorized administrative actions through forged requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Knowledge of the target:** The attacker needs to know or have access to the vulnerable Piwigo instance and that the admin is logged in
2.  **Ability to deliver malicious content:** The attacker needs to be able to trick the administrator into loading the crafted malicious HTML page, for example via a phishing email.
3.  **No prior authentication required:**  The attacker doesn't need to directly interact with the Piwigo admin interface once they've tricked the administrator into performing actions on the malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit `03a8329b89c0d196ecdb54227a8113f24555ffc0` addresses this vulnerability by adding `pwg_token` to the relevant forms and links, thus preventing CSRF attacks.
*   The issue report #721 describes the vulnerability in detail along with proof of concept exploit code.
