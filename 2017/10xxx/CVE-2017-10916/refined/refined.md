Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Xen handles the Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) and Protection Key (PKU) CPU features during vCPU context switches.
*   Xen's vCPU context switch code saves and restores MPX and PKU state only if the guest has set the relevant XSTATE enable bits. However, the use of these features is not dependent (PKU) or may not be dependent (MPX) on having the relevant XSTATE bits enabled.
*   VMs that use MPX or PKU and perform context switching manually instead of using XSAVE, will experience state leakage between vCPUs, even potentially across different guests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:**  The primary vulnerability is an information leak of control information, including pointers into the guest's address space. This leakage can weaken address space randomization, making other attacks easier.
*   **Incorrect Protection State:** When a guest receives leaked MPX or PKU state, it operates with incorrect protection configurations. This can weaken the intended protections, potentially allowing for attacks that would otherwise be blocked. It can also cause denial of service by preventing legitimate access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Weakened Address Space Randomization:** Leaked address space pointers can make it easier to bypass address space layout randomization (ASLR) and other memory protection mechanisms.
*   **Weakened MPX/PKU Protections:** Incorrect protection state in a guest can compromise the intended memory protections offered by MPX and PKU, potentially leading to further exploitation.
*   **Denial of Service:** Incorrect state can cause legitimate accesses to fail, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest:** A malicious HVM guest that uses MPX or PKU and performs manual context switching can trigger the state leakage. This state can then corrupt the state of another vCPU.
*   **Inter-Guest Leakage:** The leaked state can potentially affect other vCPUs in the same or different guests, allowing for cross-guest attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **HVM Guest:** The attacker must have control over a Hypervisor Virtual Machine (HVM) guest.
*   **MPX/PKU Usage:** The attacker guest must utilize either the Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) or Protection Key (PKU) features.
*   **Manual Context Switching:** The attacker must also perform context switches manually, rather than using the XSAVE mechanism, to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory mentions that while MPX appears not to interact with BND* state under certain conditions, it is still included as a precaution due to unclear CPU documentation.
*   Guests that use XSAVE for context switching are not vulnerable to inbound corruption. Linux, which uses XSAVE, is not vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability only affects x86 hardware that implements MPX or PKU, specifically Intel Skylake and later processors (for MPX) and Intel Skylake Server and later processors (for PKU).
*   ARM hardware is not vulnerable.
*   PV guests are not vulnerable to this issue.
*   Mitigation is possible for PKU through the hypervisor command-line option "pku=0", but no such option exists for MPX.
