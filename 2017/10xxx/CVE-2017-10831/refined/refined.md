- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer of "The CRCA user's Software" has an issue with the DLL search path, which leads to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries. Specifically, the installer may load a malicious DLL from an attacker-controlled location due to an insecure DLL search path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427). The installer does not properly validate the location of DLLs it loads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the user invoking the installer. An attacker can execute malicious code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will load it.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a specific folder where the installer will search for it. The user must then execute the vulnerable installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to a location searched by the installer for DLLs, and trick the user into running the installer.
