- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installer for the Photo Collection PC Software has an issue with the search paths for DLL/executable files. This allows it to insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries and invoke executable files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading and command execution due to improper search paths. ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer by tricking the user into placing a malicious DLL or executable in a specific folder.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, where the attacker needs to place a malicious DLL or executable file in a specific location where the installer will look for it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL or executable file in a specific folder accessible to the user running the installer. User interaction is required to initiate the installer execution and trigger the vulnerability.
