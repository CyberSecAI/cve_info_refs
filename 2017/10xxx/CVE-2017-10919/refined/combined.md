    physical-to-machine memory mappings may result in privilege
    escalation, denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2017-10919

    Julien Grall discovered that that incorrect handling of
    virtual interrupt injection on ARM systems may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2017-10920 / CVE-2017-10921 / CVE-2017-10922

    Jan Beulich discovered multiple places where reference
    counting on grant table operations was incorrect, resulting
    in potential privilege escalation

CVE-2017-12135

    Jan Beulich found multiple problems in the handling of
    transitive grants which could result in denial of service
    and potentially privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12136

    Ian Jackson discovered that race conditions in the allocator
    for grant mappings may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation. This only affects Debian stretch.

CVE-2017-12137

    Andrew Cooper discovered that incorrect validation of
    grants may result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12855

    Jan Beulich discovered that incorrect grant status handling, thus
    incorrectly informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use.

XSA-235 (no CVE yet)

    Wei Liu discovered that incorrect locking of add-to-physmap
    operations on ARM may result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.4.1-9+deb8u10.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.1-1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2017-10919 / XSA-223
                              version 3

              ARM guest disabling interrupt may crash Xen

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Virtual interrupt injection could be triggered by a guest when sending
an SGI (e.g IPI) to any vCPU or by configuring timers. When the virtual
interrupt is masked, a missing check in the injection path may result in
reading invalid hardware register or crashing the host.

IMPACT
======

A guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service
(DoS).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions which support ARM are affected.

x86 systems are not affected.

MITIGATION
==========

On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than
guest administrator, running only kernels which do not disable SGI and
PPI (i.e IRQ < 32) will prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting
this issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it
unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into
the kernel (e.g by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other
mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of ARM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

xsa223.patch           xen-unstable, Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x, Xen 4.6.x, Xen 4.5.x

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
