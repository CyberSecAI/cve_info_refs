Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to GraphicsMagick incorrectly handling certain image files. Specifically, a flaw in the `coders/dpx.c` file in how it processes DPX image files. The code didn't properly validate the file size based on the header information. It was allocating memory based on the potentially malicious header values without validating it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The Debian security advisory (DLA 1755-1) mentions heap-based buffer over-reads as a potential issue.
*   **Memory leak:** The DLA 1755-1 advisory also mentions a potential memory leak.
*   **Insufficient file size validation:**  The code reads the image header for width and other data, then allocates memory based on those values without sufficient validation, potentially leading to an attempt to read past the end of the file data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause a DoS by providing a crafted image file that triggers the vulnerability. This could be achieved by providing a DPX file with a valid header and a huge image width that causes excessive memory allocation or a buffer over-read.
*    **Information Disclosure:** The Debian security advisory (DLA 1755-1) also mentions information disclosure as a potential impact. A heap-based buffer over-read could potentially expose sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious image files:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted image file by GraphicsMagick. Specifically, DPX files are implicated, where a malformed header can cause problems during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted DPX image file to the GraphicsMagick software for processing. This could be through a web application that uses GraphicsMagick, a file upload function, or a locally run image processing command.
*  The attacker doesn't seem to need prior access to the system, just the ability to have the vulnerable software process the malformed image.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix implemented in the code involves estimating the minimum required file size based on the header information and rejecting files with insufficient data, preventing the excessive memory allocation and potential buffer over-reads.
* The fix also includes additional checks on file size if using a seekable blob, comparing the claimed file size from the header and ensuring enough data is present before allocating memory.
*   The issue was resolved in GraphicsMagick version 1.3.23-1ubuntu0.2 for Ubuntu 16.04 (as indicated in the Ubuntu Security Notice).
*   The Debian security advisory (DSA 4321-1) also mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.30+hg15796-1~deb9u1 for Debian 9 (stretch).
* The Debian LTS advisory (DLA 1755-1) also mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.20-3+deb8u6 for Debian 8 "Jessie".
