The provided content relates to CVE-2017-10973.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in FineCMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application is vulnerable to SSRF, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal or external resources from the server.
- The `get_image_data.php` file used the `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` variable, which is controllable by the user, to construct URLs, leading to SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially scan internal networks, access internal services, or make requests to external resources, potentially leading to data leakage or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can manipulate the `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` variable through a crafted HTTP request, causing the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` variable.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved two main actions:
    1.  Filtering the file suffix to only allow `'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'png', 'swf', 'bmp'`
    2.  Replacing the controllable variable `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` with `/config/config.php DOMAIN_NAME` to prevent arbitrary host header injection.
