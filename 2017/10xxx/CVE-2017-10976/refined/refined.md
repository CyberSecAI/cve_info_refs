The provided content is related to CVE-2017-10976.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `readBlock()` function of the `ttftool` utility within the swftools project. This occurs due to an uncontrolled `memcpy` operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `memcpy` in `readBlock()` attempts to copy more data into a buffer than it can hold, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The overflow leads to a crash, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer error report.
- Potential for code execution: Although the immediate impact is a crash, heap overflows can often be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted TTF file: A specially crafted TTF file (as provided `ttf2swf_crash_memcpy`) triggers the vulnerability when processed by `ttftool`.
- File parsing: The `ttftool` application parses the malicious TTF file which leads to the overflow in the `readBlock()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted TTF file to the `ttftool` application as input.
