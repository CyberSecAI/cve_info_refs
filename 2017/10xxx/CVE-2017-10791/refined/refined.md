Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `hash_int` function within the `libpspp` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow: The `hash_int` function performs left shift operations on an integer (`x`) that can result in values exceeding the maximum representable value of the integer type, causing undefined behavior. Specifically the left shift operations on lines 112, 113 and 114 of `src/libpspp/hash-functions.c` are mentioned in the bug report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The integer overflow leads to a crash. This is observed as a negative-size-param error reported by AddressSanitizer during fuzzing, causing the `pspp-convert` program to abort.
- The crash can occur when processing a malicious input file, such as the provided "POC2" file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input file to the `pspp-convert` utility. In the provided context, the command `./pspp-convert POC2 -O csv /dev/null` triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute the `pspp-convert` tool with a specially crafted input file. This doesn't necessarily require local access, as it could be triggered on a system that processes user-supplied data, e.g. file upload.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information gives more details than the typical CVE description, such as the exact location of the vulnerability (`hash_int` function), the type of operations causing the overflow (left shifts), the crashing input sample, and the debugging information with AddressSanitizer.
- The vulnerability was detected using a custom fuzzer called "collAFL".
- The fix is included in version 0.11.0 of `pspp`.
- The bug report also includes the command line that can be used to reproduce the issue.
