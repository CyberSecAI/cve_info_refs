```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `rad_coalesce()` function in FreeRADIUS does not check for WiMAX attributes that are too large, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted RADIUS packet containing a malformed WiMAX attribute to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted RADIUS packet with a malformed WiMAX attribute.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send RADIUS packets to the server. This can be a trusted source in some cases, or an untrusted source if the server is not configured to require message authenticators."
