{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing length check in the `data2vp_wimax()` function when processing WiMAX attributes with the continuation flag set but lacking subsequent data.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could crash the FreeRADIUS server or potentially execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted request packet.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a specially crafted RADIUS packet with malformed WiMAX attributes with the continuation flag set, but without subsequent data."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send packets that are accepted by the FreeRADIUS server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.",
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability exists in versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.14 inclusive. The fix is available in freeradius 3.0.15. This was found by fuzzing."
