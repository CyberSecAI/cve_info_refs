{
  "CVE-2017-10987": {
    "description": "The `fr_dhcp_decode_suboptions()` function does not properly check if sub-options overflow the packet.",
    "root_cause": "The function `fr_dhcp_decode_suboptions()` lacks proper bounds checks, allowing it to read past the end of a DHCP packet when parsing sub-options.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "The server can read a small number of octets more data than it should, which could lead to a page fault causing the server to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending malformed DHCP packets with sub-options that exceed the packet boundary."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send DHCP packets to the FreeRADIUS server."
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The issue is present in FreeRADIUS version 3, specifically versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.14 inclusive. The patch addresses the issue by checking that sub-options do not overflow the packet."
