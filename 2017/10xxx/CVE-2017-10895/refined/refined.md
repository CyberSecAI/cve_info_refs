- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sDNSProxy.exe` application fails to properly process ICMP Port Unreachable messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of ICMP Port Unreachable messages ([CWE-703](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/703.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the application unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the network, by sending crafted ICMP Port Unreachable messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets, specifically ICMP Port Unreachable messages, to the machine running `sDNSProxy.exe`. No specific user interaction or privileges are required.
