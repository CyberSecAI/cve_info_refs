Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-10806:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow exists within the USB redirector's debug logging functionality in QEMU.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A user/process could exploit this vulnerability to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when debug mode is enabled in the USB redirector device, and debug messages are being logged.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the logging of debug messages within the QEMU USB redirector. This might be achieved by interacting with a virtual USB device connected to the QEMU instance when the logging is enabled.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `usbredir_log_data` function within `hw/usb/redirect.c`. The flawed logic constructs a formatted string using `sprintf` within a fixed-size buffer on the stack. When processing the debug data, if the data is larger than the allocated buffer the stack overflows, this has been fixed by using `qemu_hexdump` instead.

**Additional information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Li Qiang of Qihoo 360 Gear Team.
- A patch was developed and applied upstream which replaces the broken logic with a call to `qemu_hexdump` to handle the debug logging correctly, resolving the stack buffer overflow.
- This vulnerability has a low priority due to the debug logging not being enabled by default.
