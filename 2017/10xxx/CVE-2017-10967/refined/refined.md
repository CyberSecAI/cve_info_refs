Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability.
- The root cause is that the application did not properly sanitize user-provided data in the Config module. Specifically, fields within the POST request were not protected.
- The developer assumed that only administrators have access to the config module, and therefore did not implement the necessary input sanitization

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's data store.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed when an administrator views the config page.
- This malicious script could potentially steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Config module.
- An attacker with access to the Config module could inject malicious scripts through unprotected fields within a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with access to the Config module. While the developer assumed this was only administrators, the specific access control isn't explicitly detailed
- The attacker also needs to craft an XSS payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by sun@yuesec.com.
- The provided GitHub content is a pull request (#9) which contains a fix for the XSS vulnerability in the `config.php` file.
- The patch was submitted by user @passtion and merged by @andrzuk.
- The developer acknowledged the vulnerability and lack of input sanitization.
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability
- The content does not provide specifics on the vulnerability itself, and only the fix.
