Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) by the "i-FILTER 6.0 install program". This occurs because the install program doesn't properly validate the paths from which it loads DLL files, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-427:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element - The software loads DLLs from locations that are under the control of a malicious user/process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious user can place a specially crafted DLL in a location where the installer searches for DLLs. When the installer runs, it will load and execute the malicious DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the install program.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local:** An attacker needs to have write access to a directory where the install program searches for DLLs before running the install program.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to run the vulnerable installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have write access to the local file system, to inject a malicious DLL into the search path.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into running the vulnerable installer program.
- No special privileges are required by the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability affects the "i-FILTER 6.0 install program" with file version 1.0.8.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported by Eili Masami of Tachibana Lab.
- The vendor, Digital Arts Inc., has released updated versions of the install program to address this issue.
