Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-10708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the `add_hooks_info` function in `apport/report.py`. This function processes the `ExecutablePath` key from a `.crash` file.
- The code attempts to identify the path of package hooks based on the `ExecutablePath`. It iterates through parent directories of the executable path, appending `share/apport/package-hooks` to each level and adding the resulting paths to `hook_dirs` which are later used to import hook scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The `add_hooks_info` function is vulnerable to path traversal due to insufficient validation of the `ExecutablePath` field in the crash file. An attacker can insert `..` sequences within the `ExecutablePath` to traverse to arbitrary directories in the filesystem.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Because the traversed paths are used as import paths for python scripts, the attacker can provide a path to an arbitrary python script on the file system that will be executed by apport with the same privileges as the user opening the crash file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious `.crash` file with a manipulated `ExecutablePath`, an attacker can force Apport to execute arbitrary python scripts located anywhere on the filesystem. This script will be executed with the same privileges as the user opening the crash file.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** If a user opens a malicious crash file owned by root, the malicious script would be executed with root privileges, allowing an attacker to perform privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious `.crash` File:** The primary attack vector is the delivery of a specially crafted `.crash` file to a victim.
- **File Handler Association:** Ubuntu systems are configured to open `.crash` files with Apport by default, meaning that a simple click on the malicious file will trigger the exploit.
- **Delivery Methods:** Malicious `.crash` files can be delivered via email attachments, USB drives, shared network resources, or embedded inside archives.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a `.crash` file.
- **File Delivery:** The attacker needs a method to deliver the malicious file to the target machine, for example by tricking a user to open it.
- **Write Access to Target Filesystem (Optional):** To achieve privilege escalation, the attacker needs write access to a path on the target filesystem.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was discovered by Felix Wilhelm from the Google Security Team.
- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the file handler for `.crash` files and implementing stricter path validation within Apport.
- The fix involved a patch to `apport/report.py`, adding a test case to `test/test_ui.py`, and removing Apport as a file handler for .crash files in `debian/apport.install`, `setup.py` and `xdg-mime/apport.xml`.
- This vulnerability is similar to a previous bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/apport/+bug/1648806) which also allowed code execution through manipulated paths.
