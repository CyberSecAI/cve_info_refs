- **Root cause of vulnerability:** OAuth tokens were not adequately protected after being stored in the Odoo database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient access control on OAuth tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could potentially hijack another user's session by using the insufficiently protected tokens, leading to unauthorized actions and a breach of confidentiality. The severity of the impact depends on the access level of the compromised session.
- **Attack vectors:** Network exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a regular, non-portal user account to exploit.
