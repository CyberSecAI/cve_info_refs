## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Jun 29, 2017](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/17921#issue-239516552)
# Security Advisory (ODOO-SA-2017-06-15-3)

## Incorrect access control on OAuth tokens

**Affects**: All Odoo versions

**Component**: OAuth2 Authentication module

**Credits**: Wolfang Taferner (WT-IO-IT GmbH)

**CVE-ID**: [CVE-2017-10805](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10805)

## I. Background

Odoo comes with several authentication methods, some of them using

locally stored passwords, and others relying on external authentication.

One of the external authentication methods is OAuth, provided by the

OAuth module. This authentication method is not enabled by default,

and requires an external OAuth2 Authentication Provider, such as

Facebook, Google or Odoo.com's OAuth.

With OAuth, the user is redirected to the external provider during

the authentication process, and the user password is never transmitted

via Odoo. Instead, the user obtains a temporary oauth token from the

provider, which is then verified by Odoo, and used as a temporary

password.

## II. Problem Description

The OAuth token were not correctly protected once stored in the Odoo

database.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Required (regular non-portal user account required)

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 7.1 [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

A malicious user may use the insufficiently protected tokens to

hijack the session of another user and perform actions on their behalf.

Depending on the access level of the hijacked session, this may lead to

a severe breach of confidentiality.

Odoo databases that do not have the OAuth2 Authentication module

installed are not at risk.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any malicious use of this vulnerability.

## IV. Workaround

System administrators may uninstall the OAuth module to entirely disable

OAuth external authentication method, with the obvious consequence of

entirely blocking this authentication method.

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" or "odoo" and "addons"

directories), then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 8.0: [090d7a5](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/090d7a51beb51b7b27a9e7e4f2f7846fca2d3c89)
* 9.0: [0527564](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/0527564463fa9144bca906fcacf7bb4b4e68ba0a)
