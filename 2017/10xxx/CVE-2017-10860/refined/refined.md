Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insecure loading of DLLs and invocation of executable files by the "i-filter 6.0" installer and install program. Specifically, the installer and install program do not properly validate the paths or origins of DLLs and executables that they load or execute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installer and install program are vulnerable to insecure DLL loading. This means they can be tricked into loading malicious DLLs from untrusted locations.
*   **Insecure Executable Invocation (CWE-427):** The installer is also vulnerable to insecurely invoking executable files, potentially running malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer or install program.
*   This could lead to a full compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves placing a malicious DLL or executable in a location where the installer or install program will find it, leading to it being loaded/executed.
*   This could involve a local attack by an attacker with file system write access or a more complex attack via other means of file delivery.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL or executable file in a location accessible to the vulnerable software.
*   The user needs to run the vulnerable installer or install program which will then load the malicious DLL or execute the malicious executable.
*   Successful exploitation requires user interaction (running the installer).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both the installer (`setup32.exe`/`setup64.exe`) and the install program (`if6installer.exe`).
*   The issue with the installer is addressed by ensuring a timestamp of code signing is on or after 23 Aug 2017 (JST).
*   The issue with the install program is addressed with version 1.0.9.1 or later.

**Summary of CVEs:**

*   **CVE-2017-10858** relates to the insecure DLL loading vulnerability in the `i-filter 6.0 install program` file version 1.0.8.1 and earlier.
*  **CVE-2017-10859** relates to the insecure DLL loading vulnerability in the `i-filter 6.0 installer` with code signing before 23 Aug 2017 (JST).
*   **CVE-2017-10860** relates to the insecure executable invocation vulnerability in the `i-filter 6.0 installer` with code signing before 23 Aug 2017 (JST).
