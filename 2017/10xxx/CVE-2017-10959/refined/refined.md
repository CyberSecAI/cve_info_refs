Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability addressed by CVE-2017-10959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `setAction` method of `Link` objects within Foxit Reader.
*   The root cause is a lack of validation of an object's existence before operations are performed on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Use-After-Free: The core vulnerability is a use-after-free, meaning the application tries to access an object that has already been freed from memory. This is caused by improper object existence validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   The attacker's code executes within the context of the current process, which is the Foxit Reader application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Malicious PDF Files: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that exploits the vulnerability when opened by Foxit Reader.
*   Malicious Web Pages: Users can be redirected to a malicious webpage containing a crafted PDF or trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Remote attacker: The attacker does not need local access to the target machine.
*   User interaction is required, as the target user must either open the malicious PDF or visit a webpage containing the exploit.
