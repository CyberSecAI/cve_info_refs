Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The installer for "Remote Support Tool (Enkaku Support Tool)" has a vulnerability related to the DLL search path. It insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) due to an issue in the way it searches for these libraries during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The primary vulnerability is the insecure loading of DLLs, meaning the installer doesn't properly validate the source or location of the DLLs it loads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the privileges of the user running the installer. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **DLL Hijacking/Planting:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer searches for DLLs. When the installer is launched, it could load the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a specific folder that the installer would search. This likely requires local access to the system or the ability to manipulate a location where the installer might search for DLLs
- **Social Engineering (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, this type of attack typically requires some form of social engineering to trick the user into running the installer on a compromised system.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- **Affected Products:** All versions of "Remote Support Tool (Enkaku Support Tool)" distributed through the website until August 10, 2017.
- **Mitigation:** Users are advised to delete old installers and use the latest version available from the developer's website. Users who already installed the tool are not affected unless they re-run the vulnerable installer.
- **CVSS Scores:** The vulnerability is given a CVSS v3 score of 7.8 (High) and a CVSS v2 score of 6.8 (Medium).
- **JPCERT/CC Analysis:** The analysis notes that the attack scenario involves tricking the user into placing a malicious DLL in a specific folder.
- **Vendor Response:** Both NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE EAST CORPORATION and NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WEST CORPORATION acknowledged the vulnerability and provided updated installers.
