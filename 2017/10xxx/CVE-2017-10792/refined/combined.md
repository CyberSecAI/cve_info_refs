```
I'm very pleased to announce the release of a new version of GNU PSPP.
PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data.  It is a
free replacement for the proprietary program SPSS.

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature[*]:
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/pspp/pspp-0.11.0.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/pspp/pspp-0.11.0.tar.gz.sig

Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
  <http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify pspp-0.11.0.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys C6648E90

and rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

Changes from 0.10.2 to 0.11.0:

 * The REGRESSION command now has a /ORIGIN subcommand to perform
   regression through the origin.

 * The FACTOR command can now analyse matrix files prepared with MATRIX DATA.

 * The FACTOR command can now print the anti-image matrices.

 * The MATRIX DATA command has been added.

 * Some inappropriate properties in selection dialogs have been corrected.

 * A bug which could cause the HTML driver to go into a tight loop
   has been fixed.

 * An error in the FREQUENCIES procedure, where the word "Mean" was
   printed when "Variance" was appropriate has been fixed.

 * The ncurses library is no longer required or used.

 * A bug where the Mann-Whitney test would give misleading results
   if run on multiple variables and MISSING=ANALAYSIS was specified
   has been fixed.

 * Gtk+3.14.5 or later must now be used when building.

 * Graphical user interface changes:

 ** There is a new menu: Edit|Options

 ** The Non Parametric Statistics Menu has a new item: "K Independent Samples".

 ** Dialog boxes can now be canceled using the <Escape> key.

 * The AUTORECODE command now accepts an optional / before INTO.

 * The short form of the VECTOR command can now create string variables.

 * Bug fixes, including fixes for CVE-2017-10791 and CVE-2017-10792.
