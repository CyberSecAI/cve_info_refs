Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10848:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) by the installer for DocuWorks 8.0.7 and earlier, and the installer for DocuWorks Viewer Light published in Jul 2017 and earlier. This means the affected software improperly searches for DLL files, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Search Order Hijacking (CWE-427):** The installers do not properly specify the location of DLL files, making them susceptible to loading malicious DLL files from untrusted locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer will load it, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the administrative user invoking the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer will load it. This often involves placing the malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer or a directory searched by the installer.
- **User Interaction:** The user must execute the vulnerable installer to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the local filesystem in a location where the vulnerable installer will search for DLLs.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into running the vulnerable installer.
