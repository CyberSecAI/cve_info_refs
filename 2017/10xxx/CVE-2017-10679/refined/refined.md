The provided content relates to CVE-2017-10679.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a combination of two issues:
1.  **Incorrect permissions handling**: Private albums can be discovered by brute-forcing their IDs. When a request is made for a private album by ID, the server reveals the album's permalink in the response, even though the album is meant to be private.
2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The application lacks CSRF protection in the `cat_options` and `permalinks` pages, allowing an attacker to perform unauthorized actions like changing the status of private albums to public, deleting permalinks or unlocking albums,

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Private album permalinks are exposed through requests to their IDs.
*   **CSRF:** Lack of CSRF protection allows unauthorized modification of album settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can discover private albums by brute-forcing IDs.
*   An attacker can reveal the permalinks of private albums.
*   An attacker can set private albums to public, delete permalinks and unlock albums by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Brute-forcing**: Attackers can discover private album IDs by sending a series of requests with incremented IDs and checking the server response.
*   **CSRF**: An attacker can craft malicious HTML pages containing forms that submit requests to change album settings on the Piwigo application. A logged in admin who visits the malicious page will perform the unwanted actions without his knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to know the base URL of the Piwigo installation
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests or HTML forms for exploitation
*   For CSRF attacks the attacker needs to trick a logged in administrator into visiting a malicious web page.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content includes Proof-of-Concept exploits for the CSRF vulnerability and HTTP request examples. It also highlights that a successful status code 200 means the album is accessible, while 301 means no privilege.
