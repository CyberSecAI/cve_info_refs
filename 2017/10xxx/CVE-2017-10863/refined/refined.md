- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HIBUN Confidential File Decryption program has a flaw in how it searches for Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), leading to insecure DLL loading.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427). The program does not properly validate the location from where DLLs are loaded, allowing it to load DLLs from untrusted locations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the HIBUN Confidential File Decryption program.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in a location where the HIBUN program searches for DLLs. When the program starts, it will load the malicious DLL instead of the intended one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into placing the malicious DLL in a specific folder that is part of the program's DLL search path.
