Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-10807

**Description:** JabberD 2.x before 2.6.1 allows anyone to authenticate using SASL ANONYMOUS, even when the `sasl.anonymous` c2s.xml option is not enabled.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check of the offered SASL mechanism during the authentication process. The server was not properly verifying if the requested authentication mechanism was enabled, leading to successful anonymous authentication even when it should have been disabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing check:** The core issue is a missing or inadequate check that was supposed to verify if the SASL ANONYMOUS mechanism was enabled in the server configuration.
*   **Bypass of intended security:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the intended security configuration, as anonymous authentication could be performed despite being disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the Jabber server by authenticating anonymously.
*   **Potential DoS:**  The bug could be exploited for unauthorized usage, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by overloading the server with anonymous connections.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the Jabber server can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **SASL ANONYMOUS:** The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker attempts to authenticate using the SASL ANONYMOUS mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to connect to the Jabber server via the network.
*   **Knowledge of SASL:**  The attacker needs to know that they can initiate a SASL ANONYMOUS authentication attempt, they don't require specific knowledge about the vulnerability itself.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involves adding a check in the `_c2s_sx_sasl_callback` function in `c2s/main.c` and `_sx_sasl_client_process` function in `sx/sasl.c` to ensure the requested mechanism is supported by the server configuration.
*   The fix was introduced in commit `8416ae54ecefa670534f27a31db71d048b9c7f16` and included in the 2.6.1 release
*   Debian addressed this vulnerability with DSA-3902-1, and fixed versions are 2.4.0-3+deb9u1 for the stable distribution and 2.6.1-1 for unstable.
