The provided content is related to CVE-2017-10891.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The installer for Media Go has an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427). The installer does not properly validate the location of DLL files it loads, which allows for an attacker to potentially provide their own malicious DLL.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installer. This means an attacker can gain control of the user's system and perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:** Local attack vector. An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer will load it from. The user must then run the installer. This means an attacker would likely need to trick a user into placing the file in the specific directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to place a malicious DLL on the user's system within a specific location that the installer searches during execution. They also need to trick the user into running the installer.
