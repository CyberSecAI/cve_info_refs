{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The installer of Shin Kinkyuji Houkoku Data Nyuryoku Program has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)). The application does not properly validate the location of DLLs it loads during installation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who runs the installer.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local. An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer before the user runs the installer. The user must then execute the installer."
