The provided content is related to CVE-2017-10970.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `link.php` file in Cacti 1.1.12 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A reflected XSS vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `link.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:** Remote anonymous attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This allows them to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `id` parameter of the `link.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice a victim to click on the malicious link. The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
