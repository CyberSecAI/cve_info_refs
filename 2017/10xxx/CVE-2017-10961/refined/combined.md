|  | ChangeLog: Standard Release |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Version 7.5.1 - (released 7/12/2017) |
|  | BUG FIXES & OTHER CHANGES: |
|  |  |
|  | Medium security fix: A cross-site scripting vulnerability was found that could be exploited by a malicious user by manipulating the query string of an HTTP request or REDCap link. |
|  | Medium security fix: A cross-site scripting vulnerability was found that could be exploited by a malicious user by manipulating text strings input into conversation titles or messages in REDCap Messenger. |
|  | Major bug fix: On certain occasions, the cron job that schedules Automated Survey Invitations containing conditional logic using datediff() with "today" as a parameter might mistakenly remove survey invitations that have been scheduled for another project. This would result in random survey participants not receiving their invitations. This issue occurs very seldom. |
|  | Minor security fix: A couple functions (e.g., deleting files in the File Repository or on File Upload fields) were mistakenly not being protected from Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by potential malicious users. |
