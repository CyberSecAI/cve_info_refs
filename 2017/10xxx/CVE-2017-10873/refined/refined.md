Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10873:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how OpenAM (Open Source Edition) handles authentication method switching based on AuthnContext requests from the service provider in a SAML 2.0 IdP configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is an authentication bypass. OpenAM fails to properly enforce the required authentication factors when switching authentication methods based on AuthnContext requests. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass multi-factor authentication, only needing a username and password even when additional factors like OTP are configured.
- **Improper Authentication Handling:** The vulnerability lies in the logic that processes SAML 2.0 AuthnContext requests and switches authentication methods, allowing for an inadequate authentication to be accepted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A user can bypass the expected login authentication process.
- **Access to Restricted Resources:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows attackers to access resources for which they do not have permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack occurs over the network through SAML 2.0 requests.
- **SAML 2.0 IdP Configuration:** The vulnerability is exploitable when OpenAM is configured as a SAML 2.0 IdP and configured to switch authentication methods based on AuthnContext requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send SAML 2.0 requests to the vulnerable OpenAM instance.
- **SAML Communication:** They must be able to interact with the SAML 2.0 IdP interface of OpenAM.
- **Basic Credentials:** The attacker would require valid username and password, but not additional authentication factors that are properly configured.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- **Affected Versions:** All versions of the Open Source Edition of OpenAM are vulnerable.
- **CVSS Scores:** The JVN report provides both CVSS v3 (6.3) and v2 (6.0) scores for this vulnerability.
- **Vendor Information:** The information includes statements from multiple vendors indicating they are vulnerable, not vulnerable and information on how to remediate the vulnerability.
