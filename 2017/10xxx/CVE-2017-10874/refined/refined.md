- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PWR-Q200 mobile WiFi router uses a fixed source port for DNS queries. This predictable source port makes the device vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Use of a fixed source port for DNS queries (CWE-330)
    - DNS cache poisoning
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can spoof DNS responses, redirecting devices on the LAN to malicious servers. This allows the attacker to potentially carry out various attacks like phishing, malware distribution etc.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is conducted remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send spoofed DNS responses to the vulnerable device before the legitimate DNS response arrives.
