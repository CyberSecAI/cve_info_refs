- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ZTE Microwave NR8000 series products use a Java RMI service with the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library, which is vulnerable to Java deserialization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Java deserialization vulnerability due to the use of the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library in the RMI service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target host.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted RMI request to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the exposed RMI service port of the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
