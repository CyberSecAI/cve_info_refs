Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-10687:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `libsass` library. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered within the `json_mkstream()` function, located in `libsass/src/sass_context.cpp` at line 91. The issue occurs during the construction of a string within an error message context.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The code attempts to copy a portion of a string into a buffer, but fails to properly validate the size, leading to a buffer overflow. This is triggered within the `std::string` constructor, specifically when trying to copy characters in the context of generating a diagnostic message.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash/Denial of Service: The immediate effect of the overflow is a crash of the application, leading to denial of service.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten memory region.

**Attack vectors:**
- Input file manipulation: By crafting a malicious input file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path within `libsass`. The provided "POC1" attachment demonstrates this capability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an error occurs during Sass parsing. The error message generation then causes the buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted input to the `libsass` library.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `sassc` tool with a specially crafted input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using a custom fuzzer called "collAFL" by the OWL337 team.
- The bug report confirms the heap overflow with address sanitizer output, showing the memory corruption.
- The `libsass` version affected is stated to be <= latest at the time of the report.
- The bug was initially reported against Fedora 27, but was closed due to EOL and never fixed in that distribution
- The bug was not reported upstream to libsass.
