The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `admin/profile.php` file of the GetSimpleCMS application.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Display Name` field in the user profile is vulnerable to XSS. User-supplied input to this field is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed back to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can be executed in the context of another user's browser session. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects JavaScript code into the `Display Name` field within the user's profile settings. The payload `"><script>alert(/xss/)</script>` demonstrates a successful attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the `Display Name` field of a user profile, implying they would need to be authenticated to the application, with necessary permissions to modify profile settings.
