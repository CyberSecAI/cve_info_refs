Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10868:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flaw in processing HTTP/1 headers. Specifically, the H2O worker process crashes when it receives an HTTP request with an invalid framing specifier (i.e., a malformed `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding` header).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation (CWE-20) when parsing HTTP/1 headers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The crash of the H2O worker process disrupts other in-flight requests, effectively causing a service disruption. The worker process may automatically respawn depending on the configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP/1 request with an invalid framing specifier to the H2O server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected H2O server. No authentication is required. The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in H2O versions up to 2.2.2 when serving HTTP/1 traffic.
- The fix is to upgrade to version 2.2.3.
