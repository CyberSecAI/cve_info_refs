- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `opertype` parameter, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure of database information.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can send crafted requests to the vulnerable application.
