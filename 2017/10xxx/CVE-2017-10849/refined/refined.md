Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2017-10849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) by self-extracting documents generated by DocuWorks. The application does not properly validate the location from which it loads DLLs, leading to a DLL hijacking issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The self-extracting document does not use a safe search path when loading DLLs, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs if placed in the same directory as the executable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL in the same folder as the self-extracting document (.exe). When the document is executed, it will load the attacker's DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the document.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker must convince a user to execute a self-extracting document (`.exe`) generated by DocuWorks, with a malicious DLL placed in the same directory as the document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the self-extracting document and trick the victim into running the document. The attacker requires no privileges to perform the exploitation. The user needs to initiate the execution.
