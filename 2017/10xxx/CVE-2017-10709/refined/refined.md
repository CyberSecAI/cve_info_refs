Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-10709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the lock screen implementation of the Elephone P9000. Specifically, the phone automatically logs in when the correct PIN is entered without requiring an additional confirmation (like pressing an "OK" button). This behavior is exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Bypass of Lockout Mechanism:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the standard lockout mechanism. The phone is supposed to prevent brute-force attempts by locking out the user after several incorrect PIN entries. However, this mechanism is circumvented due to the automatic login feature.
-   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate PIN entry attempts. When a wrong PIN is entered, and the user presses backspace to correct it, the system doesn't count it as a failed attempt. This allows the attacker to continually try new PINs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the lock screen and gain full access to the device, including personal data and applications.
-   **Data Exposure:** All data stored on the device becomes accessible to the attacker.
-   **Circumvention of Security Settings:** The vulnerability bypasses the security feature that would normally wipe the phone after a specific number of incorrect attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the device.
-   **Automated Brute-Force:** The described exploit uses a USB-connected device (TeeNC USB mimicking a keyboard) to automate the PIN entry attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Physical Possession of Device:** The attacker needs to have the phone in their possession.
-   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs some technical expertise to create or use the automated brute-forcing tool, which can be a custom device simulating a USB keyboard.

**Additional Details:**

- The video demonstration shows how the attacker can enter a wrong PIN, delete it using backspace, and then try again without triggering the lockout mechanism.
- The attack speed is limited to approximately 10 attempts per second to avoid errors on the login screen.
- The time it takes to brute-force the PIN depends on the length of the PIN. A 4-digit PIN could be cracked in about 15 minutes, 5-digits in 3 hours, and a 6-digit PIN (the maximum) in a little over a day.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the phone's security measures against brute-force attacks, even those that wipe the device after too many failed attempts.
- Trustwave researchers reported the vulnerability to Elephone but did not receive a response, indicating that there is no patch available for this issue. The recommendation is to use a password instead of a PIN to make the brute-force attack take longer.
