Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-10841:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **directory traversal** vulnerability present in WebCalendar.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The application allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended web root by manipulating file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker logged in as an administrator can access arbitrary local files on the server. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data, including configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive information stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   The attack requires the attacker to have high privileges (PR:H), meaning they must be logged in as an administrator.
*   The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).
*   The vulnerability scope is changed (S:C), since a successful attack will give the attacker access to a different part of the file system than what the application usually accesses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.1 and a CVSS v2 base score of 4.0.
*   The vulnerability affects WebCalendar versions 1.2.7 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.8.
