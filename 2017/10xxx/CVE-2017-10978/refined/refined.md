{
  "cveId": "CVE-2017-10978",
  "description": "The `make_secret()` function does not properly check for output buffer size before writing data. It can perform a read or write overflow of up to 16 octets.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Improper bounds checking in the `make_secret()` function when writing data to the output buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Read/write overflow",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service is possible due to server crash. In certain setups, it may be possible to cause a proxy server to crash.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Sending a RADIUS packet with a malformed Ascend-Send-Secret attribute of incorrect length, causing an over-read.",
      "Sending a large Access-Accept response that results in an over-write during the creation of an Ascend-Send-Secret attribute."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send packets which are accepted by the server (either directly or via a RADIUS proxy or home server). Message-Authenticator attribute in RADIUS Access-Request packets can mitigate this issue if enabled and enforced.",
    "additionalDetails": "The `make_secret()` function calculates an MD5 digest which is then XOR'ed with a value. The vulnerability occurs during this XOR operation if the length of the value is greater than the output buffer size."
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
    "FreeRADIUS versions 2.0.0 through 3.0.14"
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "Ensure that the `make_secret()` function checks for bounds on the encapsulating packet."
