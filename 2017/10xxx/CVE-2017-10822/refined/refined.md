- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer for "Shin Sekiyu Yunyu Chousa Houkoku Data Nyuryoku Program" has an issue with its DLL search path, which can lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)). The installer does not properly validate the location from which DLLs are loaded.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious DLL can be placed in the same directory as the installer. When the installer runs, it may load the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same directory where the installer is executed. The user needs to run the installer.
