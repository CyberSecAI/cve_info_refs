Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a double free condition within the `bdfwfpf` kernel driver. This occurs due to the lack of validation on the existence of an object before operations are performed on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Double Free:** The driver attempts to free the same memory location twice, leading to memory corruption. This is triggered through a specific IOCTL code.
* **Lack of Object Validation**: The core issue stems from the driver not checking whether an object is valid before attempting to operate on it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, resulting in full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
* **IOCTL Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `0x8000E038` IOCTL code sent to the `bdfwfpf` driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the local machine. This suggests the vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely.
* The attacker does not need administrative access initially but can escalate to SYSTEM privileges using the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects Bitdefender Total Security.
* It is confirmed on AV 2017 build version 21.2.25.30 and AV 2018 build versions starting from 22.0.8.114.
