Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8347:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `ReadEXRImage` function within the `exr.c` file of ImageMagick. This function fails to properly deallocate memory when processing specially crafted EXR image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The core issue is a memory leak, where memory is allocated but not freed after it's no longer needed. This can occur in multiple areas of the code path when handling EXR images.
*   **Lack of Proper Resource Management:** The code fails to release acquired resources, leading to the accumulation of leaked memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly processing malicious EXR files, an attacker can exhaust available memory, causing the application to slow down, become unresponsive, or crash. This effectively renders the affected system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious EXR File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted EXR image file that triggers the memory leak when processed by `ReadEXRImage`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious EXR file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted EXR file to the ImageMagick application. This could be done through various means such as:
    *   Uploading the file to a web service that uses ImageMagick.
    *   Sending the file to a user who opens it with ImageMagick.
    *   Including the file in a document that is processed using ImageMagick.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided Github issue includes a detailed breakdown of memory leaks reported by AddressSanitizer (ASAN), including stack traces which highlight the allocation locations of the leaked memory.
*   Multiple indirect memory leaks are reported with varying sizes. This suggests the function is not just leaking from a single memory allocation, but has multiple possible code paths that can leak memory.
*   The direct leak is 13488 bytes, and indirect leaks include multiple allocations of different sizes that total to 46923 bytes. This is a significant amount of memory that can be leaked by an attacker.
*   The issue details that the vulnerability was found in ImageMagick 7.0.5-5.
*   A test case, a malicious EXR file, is provided, which demonstrates the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The Debian Security Advisory (DSA) confirms that CVE-2017-8347 was fixed in imagemagick package updates.
* The DSA indicates that multiple other CVEs were addressed in the same update.

This information provides a solid understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, and the potential impact.
