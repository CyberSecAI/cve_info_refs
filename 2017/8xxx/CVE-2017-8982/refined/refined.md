Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for a previous path traversal vulnerability (ZDI-17-161). The patch added a `normalizeSyntax()` function to sanitize input URLs, but this function could be bypassed by URL encoding the ".." characters in the URL (e.g., using `%2e%2e` instead of `..`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The flawed `normalizeSyntax()` function in `UrlAccessController` allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass access controls and access resources that should be protected.
2.  **Expression Language (EL) Injection:** The `ictExpertDownload.xhtml` page uses the `beanName` parameter in a way that allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary EL expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the authentication bypass and the EL injection vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The authentication bypass allows access to protected resources, and the EL injection allows arbitrary code execution as the SYSTEM user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable HPE iMC server.
*   The attacker first bypasses authentication using the URL-encoded path traversal in the URL (e.g., `/imc/primepush/%2e%2e/<target URI>`).
*   Then, the attacker injects a malicious EL expression through the `beanName` parameter in a request to `ictExpertDownload.xhtml` (e.g., `/imc/primepush/%2e%2e/ict/export/ictExpertDownload.xhtml?beanName=<malicious EL>`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable HPE iMC server.
*   **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `UrlAccessController` class is a Java servlet filter used for access control.
*   The `normalizeSyntax()` function was intended to prevent path traversal attacks but was bypassed by URL encoding.
*   The `ictTableExportBean` and `FacesUtils` classes are involved in the EL injection process.
*   The `imcf:beanMethod` custom tag is part of the vulnerability chain for EL injection.
*   The vulnerable `ictExpertDownload.xhtml` page is located at `C:\Program Files\iMC\client\web\apps\imc\ict\export`.
*   The vulnerable `UrlAccessController` class is located within `imcweb_plat.jar`.
*   The exploit is known to work on iMC PLAT v7.3 (E0504P02) on Windows 2k12r2 x64 (EN).
*   The Metasploit module uses a payload like `facesContext.getExternalContext().redirect("".getClass().forName("javax.script.ScriptEngineManager").newInstance().getEngineByName("JavaScript").eval("var proc=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder[\"(java.lang.String[])\"]([\"cmd.exe\",\"/c\",<command>]).start();"))` to execute arbitrary commands.
