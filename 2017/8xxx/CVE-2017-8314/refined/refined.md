Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the ZipManager component of Kodi (formerly XBMC). Specifically, the software does not properly sanitize file paths within ZIP archives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to include relative path components (like "..") in the names of files stored within a ZIP archive. This allows an attacker to specify a target file location outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting system files or other sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:**  An attacker can create a malicious ZIP file containing subtitles which when processed by Kodi, allows the attacker to overwrite any file that the user running Kodi has write permission to. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can also lead to a denial-of-service condition, although this is less emphasized than the arbitrary file write.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious ZIP File:** The attack vector involves enticing a user to download and open a specially crafted ZIP file using Kodi. This ZIP file would contain malicious file paths in the names of files contained within it.
- **Subtitle Files:** The specific use case mentioned is when a user downloads a malicious subtitle file that is contained within a ZIP archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker is typically remote and does not require local access to the user's machine.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious ZIP file (often containing subtitles) with Kodi. This could be achieved via social engineering.
