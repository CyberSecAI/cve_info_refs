## Description

Skip items in a zip file, which try to traverse to a parent directory.

Backport of [#12023](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/12023)

## Motivation and Context

Without this a zip file can override every file the current user has write permission.

## How Has This Been Tested?

Tested with a malicious zip file.

| Hello,  is this already available here? <https://kodi.tv/download>  I see it is in the milestone and from <https://kodi.tv/download> seems that 17.2 has been released also there.  I just wanted to double check. (also it is all on all platforms right?) |

Package        : xbmc
Version        : 2:11.0~git20120510.82388d5-1+deb7u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-8314
Debian Bug     : 863230

The Check Point Research Team discovered that the XBMC media center
allows arbitrary file write when a malicious subtitle file is
downloaded in zip format. This update requires the new dependency
libboost-regex1.49.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
2:11.0~git20120510.82388d5-1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xbmc packages.
