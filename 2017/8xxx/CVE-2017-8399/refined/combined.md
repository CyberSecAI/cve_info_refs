# PCRE2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201710-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in PCRE2, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libpcre2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **10.30** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **10.30** |

### Background

PCRE2 is a project based on PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)
which has a new and revised API.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PCRE2. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or have
other unspecified impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PCRE2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre2-10.30"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
