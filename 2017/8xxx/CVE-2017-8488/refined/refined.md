Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS` handler within `mountmgr.sys`. The handler copies uninitialized pool memory to user-mode clients due to alignment holes within the output structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the disclosure of kernel pool memory, which can contain sensitive data.
- **Uninitialized Memory:** The output buffer contains uninitialized bytes due to structure alignment issues, specifically after `SymbolicLinkNameLength`, `UniqueIdLength`, and `DeviceNameLength` fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass:** Repeatedly triggering the vulnerability could reveal kernel memory addresses, potentially defeating KASLR.
- **Information Leak:**  Attackers could read other secrets present in the kernel address space.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access:** The vulnerability is accessible to local, authenticated users/attackers.
- **IOCTL Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS` IOCTL (DeviceIoControl) on the `MountPointManager` device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated (i.e. have a valid user account) to send the IOCTL request.

**Technical Details**
- The output data is returned in a `MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS` structure, containing a list of `MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT` structures.
- The alignment holes after fields `SymbolicLinkNameLength`, `UniqueIdLength` and `DeviceNameLength` (all of type USHORT) are followed by LONG fields which must be 4-aligned, causing uninitialized memory to be included in the output buffer.
- The amount of leaked bytes depends on the number of entries returned by the IOCTL.
- Special Pools markers can be used to confirm the memory leakage.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability and observe the leaked memory by sending the vulnerable IOCTL.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Google Security Research.
