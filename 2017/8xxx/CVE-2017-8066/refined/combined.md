Fixes: [05ca527](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/05ca5270005c18ec46decacef87992ea968f9fce) can: gs_usb: add ethtool set_phys_id callback to locate physical device

The gs_usb driver is performing USB transfers using buffers allocated on
the stack. This causes the driver to not function with vmapped stacks.
Instead, allocate memory for the transfer buffers.

Subject: Silently (or obliviously) partially-fixed CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM bypass

Hi all,

I wanted to provide some small notice of upstream kernel developers silently
or obliviously partially fixing a CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM bypass which explicitly has
never been possible in grsecurity in the past 15 years.  I say this because the commit
message makes no mention of this partially fixing a CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM bypass (and I
suppose a Secure Boot bypass, but what isn't these days?), and similarly makes no
mentions of the modifications it makes to the write side.  CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM exists
to prevent userland from directly modifying kernel memory, yet the kernel will happily
make slab allocations in allowed regions below 1MB.  CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM explicitly
allowed both reads and writes to these allocations.  As noted, the commit below doesn't
fix the mmap side.

Feel free to look at GRKERNSEC_KMEM code going back to 2002 in our 2.4.20
patch, or when it changed in 2003 for 2.4.21, or this explicit hunk, comment and
all, that's been around ever since CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM was added in 2008:

+#ifdef CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_KMEM
+       /* throw out everything else below 1MB */
+       if (pagenr <= 256)
+               return 0;
+#endif

MIPS: IP22: Fix build error due to binutils 2.25 uselessnes.
commit ae2f5e5ed04a17c1aa1f0a3714c725e12c21d2a9 upstream.

MIPS has used .set mips3 to temporarily switch the assembler to 64 bit
mode in 64 bit kernels virtually forever. Binutils 2.25 broke this
behavious partially by happily accepting 64 bit instructions in .set mips3
mode but puking on 64 bit constants when generating 32 bit ELF. Binutils
2.26 restored the old behaviour again.
Fix build with binutils 2.25 by open coding the offending

li $1, 0x9000
dsll $1, $1, 48
which is ugly be the only thing that will build on all binutils vintages.

module: fix memory leak on early load\_module() failures
commit a5544880aff90baf1bd4443ac7ff65182213ffcd upstream.
While looking for early possible module loading failures I was
able to reproduce a memory leak possible with kmemleak. There
are a few rare ways to trigger a failure:
o we've run into a failure while processing kernel parameters
(parse\_args() returns an error)
o mod\_sysfs\_setup() fails
o we're a live patch module and copy\_module\_elf() fails
Chances of running into this issue is really low.

powerpc/xmon: Fix data-breakpoint
commit c21a493a2b44650707d06741601894329486f2ad upstream.
Currently xmon data-breakpoint feature is broken.
Whenever there is a watchpoint match occurs, hw\_breakpoint\_handler will
be called by do\_break via notifier chains mechanism. If watchpoint is
registered by xmon, hw\_breakpoint\_handler won't find any associated
perf\_event and returns immediately with NOTIFY\_STOP. Similarly, do\_break
also returns without notifying to xmon.
Solve this by returning NOTIFY\_DONE when hw\_breakpoint\_handler does not
find any perf\_event associated with matched watchpoint, rather than
NOTIFY\_STOP, which tells the core code to continue calling the other
breakpoint handlers including the xmon one.

xprtrdma: Reduce required number of send SGEs
commit 16f906d66cd76fb9895cbc628f447532a7ac1faa upstream.
The MAX\_SEND\_SGES check introduced in commit 655fec6987be
("xprtrdma: Use gathered Send for large inline messages") fails
for devices that have a small max\_sge.
Instead of checking for a large fixed maximum number of SGEs,
check for a minimum small number. RPC-over-RDMA will switch to
using a Read chunk if an xdr\_buf has more pages than can fit in
the device's max\_sge limit. This is considerably better than
failing all together to mount the server.
This fix supports devices that have as few as three send SGEs
available.

xprtrdma: Disable pad optimization by default
commit c95a3c6b88658bcb8f77f85f31a0b9d9036e8016 upstream.
Commit d5440e27d3e5 ("xprtrdma: Enable pad optimization") made the
Linux client omit XDR round-up padding in normal Read and Write
chunks so that the client doesn't have to register and invalidate
3-byte memory regions that contain no real data.
Unfortunately, my cheery 2014 assessment that this optimization "is
supported now by both Linux and Solaris servers" was premature.
We've found bugs in Solaris in this area since commit d5440e27d3e5
("xprtrdma: Enable pad optimization") was merged (SYMLINK is the
main offender).
So for maximum interoperability, I'm disabling this optimization
again. If a CM private message is exchanged when connecting, the
client recognizes that the server is Linux, and enables the
optimization for that connection.
Until now the Solaris server bugs did not impact common operations,
and were thus largely benign. Soon, less capable devices on Linux
NFS/RDMA clients will make use of Read chunks more often, and these
Solaris bugs will prevent interoperation in more cases.

xprtrdma: Per-connection pad optimization
commit b5f0afbea4f2ea52c613ac2b06cb6de2ea18cb6d upstream.
Pad optimization is changed by echoing into
/proc/sys/sunrpc/rdma\_pad\_optimize. This is a global setting,
affecting all RPC-over-RDMA connections to all servers.
The marshaling code picks up that value and uses it for decisions
about how to construct each RPC-over-RDMA frame. Having it change
suddenly in mid-operation can result in unexpected failures. And
some servers a client mounts might need chunk round-up, while
others don't.
So instead, copy the pad\_optimize setting into each connection's
rpcrdma\_ia when the transport is created, and use the copy, which
can't change during the life of the connection, instead.
This also removes a hack: rpcrdma\_convert\_iovs was using
the remote-invalidation-expected flag to predict when it could leave
out Write chunk padding. This is because the Linux server handles
implicit XDR padding on Write chunks correctly, and only Linux
servers can set the connection's remote-invalidation-expected flag.
It's more sensible to use the pad optimization setting instead.

xprtrdma: Fix Read chunk padding
commit 24abdf1be15c478e2821d6fc903a4a4440beff02 upstream.
When pad optimization is disabled, rpcrdma\_convert\_iovs still
does not add explicit XDR round-up padding to a Read chunk.
Commit 677eb17e94ed ("xprtrdma: Fix XDR tail buffer marshalling")
incorrectly short-circuited the test for whether round-up padding
is needed that appears later in rpcrdma\_convert\_iovs.
However, if this is indeed a regular Read chunk (and not a
Position-Zero Read chunk), the tail iovec \_always\_ contains the
chunk's padding, and never anything else.
So, it's easy to just skip the tail when padding optimization is
enabled, and add the tail in a subsequent Read chunk segment, if
disabled.

md linear: fix a race between linear\_add() and linear\_congested()
commit 03a9e24ef2aaa5f1f9837356aed79c860521407a upstream.
Recently I receive a bug report that on Linux v3.0 based kerenl, hot add
disk to a md linear device causes kernel crash at linear\_congested(). From
the crash image analysis, I find in linear\_congested(), mddev->raid\_disks
contains value N, but conf->disks[] only has N-1 pointers available. Then
a NULL pointer deference crashes the kernel.
There is a race between linear\_add() and linear\_congested(), RCU stuffs
used in these two functions cannot avoid the race. Since Linuv v4.0
RCU code is replaced by introducing mddev\_suspend(). After checking the
upstream code, it seems linear\_congested() is not called in
generic\_make\_request() code patch, so mddev\_suspend() cannot provent it
from being called. The possible race still exists.
Here I explain how the race still exists in current code. For a machine
has many CPUs, on one CPU, linear\_add() is called to add a hard disk to a
md linear device; at the same time on other CPU, linear\_congested() is
called to detect whether this md linear device is congested before issuing
an I/O request onto it.
Now I use a possible code execution time sequence to demo how the possible
race happens,
seq linear\_add() linear\_congested()
0 conf=mddev->private
1 oldconf=mddev->private
2 mddev->raid\_disks++
3 for (i=0; iraid\_disks;i++)
4 bdev\_get\_queue(conf->disks[i].rdev->bdev)
5 mddev->private=newconf
In linear\_add() mddev->raid\_disks is increased in time seq 2, and on
another CPU in linear\_congested() the for-loop iterates conf->disks[i] by
the increased mddev->raid\_disks in time seq 3,4. But conf with one more
element (which is a pointer to struct dev\_info type) to conf->disks[] is
not updated yet, accessing its structure member in time seq 4 will cause a
NULL pointer deference fault.
To fix this race, there are 2 parts of modification in the patch,
1) Add 'int raid\_disks' in struct linear\_conf, as a copy of
mddev->raid\_disks. It is initialized in linear\_conf(), always being
consistent with pointers number of 'struct dev\_info disks[]'. When
iterating conf->disks[] in linear\_congested(), use conf->raid\_disks to
replace mddev->raid\_disks in the for-loop, then NULL pointer deference
will not happen again.
2) RCU stuffs are back again, and use kfree\_rcu() in linear\_add() to
free oldconf memory. Because oldconf may be referenced as mddev->private
in linear\_congested(), kfree\_rcu() makes sure that its memory will not
be released until no one uses it any more.
Also some code comments are added in this patch, to make this modification
to be easier understandable.
This patch can be applied for kernels since v4.0 after commit:
3be260cc18f8 ("md/linear: remove rcu protections in favour of
suspend/resume"). But this bug is reported on Linux v3.0 based kernel, for
people who maintain kernels before Linux v4.0, they need to do some back
back port to this patch.
Changelog:
- V3: add 'int raid\_disks' in struct linear\_conf, and use kfree\_rcu() to
replace rcu\_call() in linear\_add().
- v2: add RCU stuffs by suggestion from Shaohua and Neil.
- v1: initial effort.

rtc: sun6i: Switch to the external oscillator
commit fb61bb82cb46a932ef2fc62e1c731c8e7e6640d5 upstream.
The RTC is clocked from either an internal, imprecise, oscillator or an
external one, which is usually much more accurate.
The difference perceived between the time elapsed and the time reported by
the RTC is in a 10% scale, which prevents the RTC from being useful at all.
Fortunately, the external oscillator is reported to be mandatory in the
Allwinner datasheet, so we can just switch to it.

f2fs: Fix zoned block device support
commit 7bb3a371d199156cb6a863feab377146b80942c5 upstream.
The introduction of the multi-device feature partially broke the support
for zoned block devices. In the function f2fs\_scan\_devices, sbi->devs
allocation and initialization is skipped in the case of a single device
mount. This result in no device information structure being allocated
for the device. This is fine if the device is a regular device, but in
the case of a zoned block device, the device zone type array is not
initialized, which causes the function \_\_f2fs\_issue\_discard\_zone to fail
as get\_blkz\_type is unable to determine the zone type of a section.
Fix this by always allocating and initializing the sbi->devs device
information array even in the case of a single device if that device is
zoned. For this particular case, make sure to obtain a reference on the
single device so that the call to blkdev\_put() in destroy\_device\_list
operates as expected.

f2fs: add ovp valid\_blocks check for bg gc victim to fg\_gc
commit e93b9865251a0503d83fd570e7d5a7c8bc351715 upstream.
For foreground gc, greedy algorithm should be adapted, which makes
this formula work well:
(2 \* (100 / config.overprovision + 1) + 6)
But currently, we fg\_gc have a prior to select bg\_gc victim segments to gc
first, these victims are selected by cost-benefit algorithm, we can't guarantee
such segments have the small valid blocks, which may destroy the f2fs rule, on
the worstest case, would consume all the free segments.
This patch fix this by add a filter in check\_bg\_victims, if segment's has # of
valid blocks over overprovision ratio, skip such segments.

nfsd: special case truncates some more
commit 783112f7401ff449d979530209b3f6c2594fdb4e upstream.
Both the NFS protocols and the Linux VFS use a setattr operation with a
bitmap of attributes to set to set various file attributes including the
file size and the uid/gid.
The Linux syscalls never mix size updates with unrelated updates like
the uid/gid, and some file systems like XFS and GFS2 rely on the fact
that truncates don't update random other attributes, and many other file
systems handle the case but do not update the other attributes in the
same transaction. NFSD on the other hand passes the attributes it gets
on the wire more or less directly through to the VFS, leading to updates
the file systems don't expect. XFS at least has an assert on the
allowed attributes, which caught an unusual NFS client setting the size
and group at the same time.
To handle this issue properly this splits the notify\_change call in
nfsd\_setattr into two separate ones.

VME: restore bus\_remove function causing incomplete module unload

Commit 050c3d52cc7810d9d17b8cd231708609af6876ae ("vme: make core
vme support explicitly non-modular") dropped the remove function
because it appeared as if it was for removal of the bus, which is
not supported.
However, vme\_bus\_remove() is called when a VME device is removed
from the bus and not when the bus is removed; as it calls the VME
device driver's cleanup function. Without this function, the
remove() in the VME device driver is never called and VME device
drivers cannot be reloaded again.
Here we restore the remove function that was deleted in that
commit, and the reference to the function in the bus structure.

RDMA/core: Fix incorrect structure packing for booleans
commit 55efcfcd7776165b294f8b5cd6e05ca00ec89b7c upstream.
The RDMA core uses ib\_pack() to convert from unpacked CPU structs
to on-the-wire bitpacked structs.
This process requires that 1 bit fields are declared as u8 in the
unpacked struct, otherwise the packing process does not read the
value properly and the packed result is wired to 0. Several
places wrongly used int.
Crucially this means the kernel has never, set reversible
correctly in the path record request. It has always asked for
irreversible paths even if the ULP requests otherwise.
When the kernel is used with a SM that supports this feature, it
completely breaks communication management if reversible paths are
not properly requested.
The only reason this ever worked is because opensm ignores the
reversible bit.

the user level daemon and the driver. When the Fcopy channel is rescinded
we need to make sure that the char device is fully cleaned up before
we can process a new Fcopy offer from the host. Implement this logic.

The host can rescind a channel that has been offered to the
guest and once the channel is rescinded, the host does not
respond to any requests on that channel. Deal with the case where
the guest may be blocked waiting for a response from the host.

After the channel is rescinded, the host does not read from the rescinded channel.
Fail writes to a channel that has already been rescinded. If we permit writes on a
rescinded channel, since the host will not respond we will have situations where
we will be unable to unload vmbus drivers that cannot have any outstanding requests

Since commit: ba1582f22231 ("usb: gadget: f\_hid: use alloc\_ep\_req()")
we cannot allocate any requests in bind() as we check if we should
align request buffer based on endpoint descriptor which is assigned
in set\_alt().
Allocating request in bind() function causes a NULL pointer
dereference.
This commit moves allocation of IN request from bind() to set\_alt()
to prevent this issue.

Since:
commit 855ed04a3758 ("usb: gadget: udc-core: independent registration

if we load gadget module but there is no free udc available
then it will be stored on a pending gadgets list.
$ modprobe g\_zero.ko
$ modprobe g\_ether.ko
[] udc-core: couldn't find an available UDC - added [g\_ether] to list
of pending drivers
We scan this list each time when new UDC appears in system.
But we can get a free UDC each time after gadget unbind.
This commit add scanning of that list directly after unbinding
gadget from udc.
Thanks to this, when we unload first gadget:
$ rmmod g\_zero.ko
gadget which is pending is automatically
attached to that UDC (if name matches).

w1: ds2490: USB transfer buffers need to be DMAable
commit 61cd1b4cd1e8f7f7642ab64529d9bd52e8374641 upstream.
ds2490 driver was doing USB transfers from / to buffers on a stack.
This is not permitted and made the driver non-working with vmapped stacks.
Since all these transfers are done under the same bus\_mutex lock we can
simply use shared buffers in a device private structure for two most common
of them.
While we are at it, let's also fix a comparison between int and size\_t in
ds9490r\_search() which made the driver spin in this function if state
register get requests were failing.

iio: pressure: mpl3115: do not rely on structure field ordering
commit 9cf6cdba586ced75c69b8314b88b2d2f5ce9b3ed upstream.
Fixes a regression triggered by a change in the layout of
struct iio\_chan\_spec, but the real bug is in the driver which assumed
a specific structure layout in the first place. Hint: the two bits were
not OR:ed together as implied by the indentation prior to this patch,
there was a comma between them, which accidentally moved the ...\_SCALE
bit to the next structure field. That field was .info\_mask\_shared\_by\_type
before the \_available attributes was added by commit 51239600074b
("iio:core: add a callback to allow drivers to provide \_available
attributes") and .info\_mask\_separate\_available afterwards, and the
regression happened.
info\_mask\_shared\_by\_type is actually a better choice than the originally
intended info\_mask\_separate for the ...\_SCALE bit since a constant is
returned from mpl3115\_read\_raw for the scale. Using
info\_mask\_shared\_by\_type also preserves the behavior from before the
regression and is therefore less likely to cause other interesting side
effects.
The above mentioned regression causes an unintended sysfs attibute to
show up that is not backed by code, in turn causing the following NULL
pointer defererence to happen on access.

iio: pressure: mpl115: do not rely on structure field ordering
commit 6a6e1d56a0769795a36c0461c64bf5e5b9bbb4c0 upstream.
Fixes a regression triggered by a change in the layout of
struct iio\_chan\_spec, but the real bug is in the driver which assumed
a specific structure layout in the first place. Hint: the three bits were
not OR:ed together as implied by the indentation prior to this patch,
there was a comma between the first two, which accidentally moved the
...\_SCALE and ...\_OFFSET bits to the next structure field. That field
was .info\_mask\_shared\_by\_type before the \_available attributes was added
by commit 51239600074b ("iio:core: add a callback to allow drivers to
provide \_available attributes") and .info\_mask\_separate\_available
afterwards, and the regression happened.
info\_mask\_shared\_by\_type is actually a better choice than the originally
intended info\_mask\_separate for the ...\_SCALE and ...\_OFFSET bits since
a constant is returned from mpl115\_read\_raw for the scale/offset. Using
info\_mask\_shared\_by\_type also preserves the behavior from before the
regression and is therefore less likely to cause other interesting side
effects.
The above mentioned regression causes unintended sysfs attibutes to
show up that are not backed by code, in turn causing a NULL pointer
defererence to happen on access.

Revert "arm64: mm: set the contiguous bit for kernel mappings where appropriate"
commit d81bbe6d882461dec4b71dbe2aa85565fcca4187 upstream.
This reverts commit 0bfc445dec9dd8130d22c9f4476eed7598524129.
When we change the permissions of regions mapped using contiguous
entries, the architecture requires us to follow a Break-Before-Make
strategy, breaking \*all\* associated entries before we can change any of
the following properties from the entries:
- presence of the contiguous bit
- output address
- attributes
- permissiones
Failure to do so can result in a number of problems (e.g. TLB conflict
aborts and/or erroneous results from TLB lookups).
See ARM DDI 0487A.k\_iss10775, "Misprogramming of the Contiguous bit",
page D4-1762.
We do not take this into account when altering the permissions of kernel
segments in mark\_rodata\_ro(), where we change the permissions of live
contiguous entires one-by-one, leaving them transiently inconsistent.
This has been observed to result in failures on some fast model
configurations.
Unfortunately, we cannot follow Break-Before-Make here as we'd have to
unmap kernel text and data used to perform the sequence.
For the timebeing, revert commit 0bfc445dec9dd813 so as to avoid issues
resulting from this misuse of the contiguous bit.

KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Stop injecting the MSI occurrence twice
commit 0bdbf3b071986ba80731203683cf623d5c0cacb1 upstream.
The IRQFD framework calls the architecture dependent function
twice if the corresponding GSI type is edge triggered. For ARM,
the function kvm\_set\_msi() is getting called twice whenever the
IRQFD receives the event signal. The rest of the code path is
trying to inject the MSI without any validation checks. No need
to call the function vgic\_its\_inject\_msi() second time to avoid
an unnecessary overhead in IRQ queue logic. It also avoids the
possibility of VM seeing the MSI twice.
Simple fix, return -1 if the argument 'level' value is zero.

arm64: fix erroneous \_\_raw\_read\_system\_reg() cases
commit 7d0928f18bf890d2853281f59aba0dd5a46b34f9 upstream.
Since it was introduced in commit da8d02d19ffdd201 ("arm64/capabilities:
Make use of system wide safe value"), \_\_raw\_read\_system\_reg() has
erroneously mapped some sysreg IDs to other registers.
For the fields in ID\_ISAR5\_EL1, our local feature detection will be
erroneous. We may spuriously detect that a feature is uniformly
supported, or may fail to detect when it actually is, meaning some
compat hwcaps may be erroneous (or not enforced upon hotplug).
This patch corrects the erroneous entries.

arm64: dma-mapping: Fix dma\_mapping\_error() when bypassing SWIOTLB
commit adbe7e26f4257f72817495b9bce114284060b0d7 upstream.
When bypassing SWIOTLB on small-memory systems, we need to avoid calling
into swiotlb\_dma\_mapping\_error() in exactly the same way as we avoid
swiotlb\_dma\_supported(), because the former also relies on SWIOTLB state
being initialised.
Under the assumptions for which we skip SWIOTLB, dma\_map\_{single,page}()
will only ever return the DMA-offset-adjusted physical address of the
page passed in, thus we can report success unconditionally.

arm/arm64: KVM: Enforce unconditional flush to PoC when mapping to stage-2
commit 8f36ebaf21fdae99c091c67e8b6fab33969f2667 upstream.
When we fault in a page, we flush it to the PoC (Point of Coherency)
if the faulting vcpu has its own caches off, so that it can observe
the page we just brought it.
But if the vcpu has its caches on, we skip that step. Bad things
happen when \*another\* vcpu tries to access that page with its own
caches disabled. At that point, there is no garantee that the
data has made it to the PoC, and we access stale data.
The obvious fix is to always flush to PoC when a page is faulted
in, no matter what the state of the vcpu is.

x86/pkeys: Check against max pkey to avoid overflows
commit 58ab9a088ddac4efe823471275859d64f735577e upstream.
Kirill reported a warning from UBSAN about undefined behavior when using
protection keys. He is running on hardware that actually has support for
it, which is not widely available.
The warning triggers because of very large shifts of integers when doing a
pkey\_free() of a large, invalid value. This happens because we never check
that the pkey "fits" into the mm\_pkey\_allocation\_map().
I do not believe there is any danger here of anything bad happening
other than some aliasing issues where somebody could do:
pkey\_free(35);
and the kernel would effectively execute:
pkey\_free(8);
While this might be confusing to an app that was doing something stupid, it
has to do something stupid and the effects are limited to the app shooting
itself in the foot.

Per Ard,
"CCM IVs are 16 bytes, but due to the way they are constructed

Fix this by padding the IV with null bytes to be at least 16 bytes.

Drivers: hv: vmbus: Raise retry/wait limits in vmbus\_post\_msg()
commit c0bb03924f1a80e7f65900e36c8e6b3dc167c5f8 upstream.
DoS protection conditions were altered in WS2016 and now it's easy to get
-EAGAIN returned from vmbus\_post\_msg() (e.g. when we try changing MTU on a
netvsc device in a loop). All vmbus\_post\_msg() callers don't retry the
operation and we usually end up with a non-functional device or crash.
While host's DoS protection conditions are unknown to me my tests show that
it can take up to 10 seconds before the message is sent so doing udelay()
is not an option, we really need to sleep. Almost all vmbus\_post\_msg()
callers are ready to sleep but there is one special case:
vmbus\_initiate\_unload() which can be called from interrupt/NMI context and
we can't sleep there. I'm also not sure about the lonely
vmbus\_send\_tl\_connect\_request() which has no in-tree users but its external
users are most likely waiting for the host to reply so sleeping there is
also appropriate.

This disables MSI (or MSIx) interrupts and the PCI device only if

we rely on the newly added parameter @disable\_device. In the path

ath9k: fix race condition in enabling/disabling IRQs
commit 3a5e969bb2f6692a256352649355d56d018d6b88 upstream.
The code currently relies on refcounting to disable IRQs from within the
IRQ handler and re-enabling them again after the tasklet has run.
However, due to race conditions sometimes the IRQ handler might be
called twice, or the tasklet may not run at all (if interrupted in the
middle of a reset).
This can cause nasty imbalances in the irq-disable refcount which will
get the driver permanently stuck until the entire radio has been stopped
and started again (ath\_reset will not recover from this).
Instead of using this fragile logic, change the code to ensure that
running the irq handler during tasklet processing is safe, and leave the
refcount untouched.

mei: remove support for broken parallel read
commit cb97fbbcac15982406e0c74cd5512a8b6fcf10b3 upstream.
Parallel reads from multiple threads on a file descriptor
are not well defined and racy. It is safer to return to original
behavior and simply fail the additional read.
The solution is to remove request for next read credit.

ext4: Include forgotten start block on fallocate insert range
commit 2a9b8cba62c0741109c33a2be700ff3d7703a7c2 upstream.
While doing 'insert range' start block should be also shifted right.
The bug can be easily reproduced by the following test:
ptr = malloc(4096);
assert(ptr);
fd = open("./ext4.file", O\_CREAT | O\_TRUNC | O\_RDWR, 0600);
assert(fd >= 0);
rc = fallocate(fd, 0, 0, 8192);
assert(rc == 0);
for (i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
\*((unsigned short \*)ptr + i) = 0xbeef;
rc = pwrite(fd, ptr, 4096, 0);
assert(rc == 4096);
rc = pwrite(fd, ptr, 4096, 4096);
assert(rc == 4096);
for (block = 2; block < 1000; block++) {
rc = fallocate(fd, FALLOC\_FL\_INSERT\_RANGE, 4096, 4096);
assert(rc == 0);
for (i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
\*((unsigned short \*)ptr + i) = block;
rc = pwrite(fd, ptr, 4096, 4096);
assert(rc == 4096);
}
Because start block is not included in the range the hole appears at
the wrong offset (just after the desired offset) and the following
pwrite() overwrites already existent block, keeping hole untouched.
Simple way to verify wrong behaviour is to check zeroed blocks after
the test:
$ hexdump ./ext4.file | grep '0000 0000'
The root cause of the bug is a wrong range (start, stop], where start
should be inclusive, i.e. [start, stop].
This patch fixes the problem by including start into the range. But
not to break left shift (range collapse) stop points to the beginning
of the a block, not to the end.
The other not obvious change is an iterator check on validness in a
main loop. Because iterator is unsigned the following corner case
should be considered with care: insert a block at 0 offset, when stop
variables overflows and never becomes less than start, which is 0.
To handle this special case iterator is set to NULL to indicate that
end of the loop is reached.

dm raid: fix data corruption on reshape request
commit d36a19541fe8f392778ac137d60f9be8dfdd8f9d upstream.
The lvm2 sequence to manage dm-raid constructor flags that trigger a
rebuild or a reshape is defined as:
1) load table with flags (e.g. rebuild/delta\_disks/data\_offset)
2) clear out the flags in lvm2 metadata
3) store the lvm2 metadata, reload the table to reset the flags
previously established during the initial load (1) -- in order to
prevent repeatedly requesting a rebuild or a reshape on activation
Currently, loading an inactive table with rebuild/reshape flags
specified will cause dm-raid to rebuild/reshape on resume and thus start
updating the raid metadata (about the progress). When the second table
reload, to reset the flags, occurs the constructor accesses the volatile
progress state kept in the raid superblocks. Because the active mapping
is still processing the rebuild/reshape, that position will be stale by
the time the device is resumed.
In the reshape case, this causes data corruption by processing already
reshaped stripes again. In the rebuild case, it does \_not\_ cause data
corruption but instead involves superfluous rebuilds.
Fix by keeping the raid set frozen during the first resume and then
allow the rebuild/reshape during the second resume.

dm round robin: revert "use percpu 'repeat\_count' and 'current\_path'"
commit 37a098e9d10db6e2efc05fe61e3a6ff2e9802c53 upstream.
The sloppy nature of lockless access to percpu pointers
(s->current\_path) in rr\_select\_path(), from multiple threads, is
causing some paths to used more than others -- which results in less
IO performance being observed.
Revert these upstream commits to restore truly symmetric round-robin
IO submission in DM multipath:
b0b477c dm round robin: use percpu 'repeat\_count' and 'current\_path'
802934b dm round robin: do not use this\_cpu\_ptr() without having preemption disabled
There is no benefit to all this complexity if repeat\_count = 1 (which is
the recommended default).

ipc/shm: Fix shmat mmap nil-page protection
commit 95e91b831f87ac8e1f8ed50c14d709089b4e01b8 upstream.
The issue is described here, with a nice testcase:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=192931
The problem is that shmat() calls do\_mmap\_pgoff() with MAP\_FIXED, and
the address rounded down to 0. For the regular mmap case, the
protection mentioned above is that the kernel gets to generate the
address -- arch\_get\_unmapped\_area() will always check for MAP\_FIXED and
return that address. So by the time we do security\_mmap\_addr(0) things
get funky for shmat().
The testcase itself shows that while a regular user crashes, root will
not have a problem attaching a nil-page. There are two possible fixes
to this. The first, and which this patch does, is to simply allow root
to crash as well -- this is also regular mmap behavior, ie when hacking
up the testcase and adding mmap(... |MAP\_FIXED). While this approach
is the safer option, the second alternative is to ignore SHM\_RND if the
rounded address is 0, thus only having MAP\_SHARED flags. This makes the
behavior of shmat() identical to the mmap() case. The downside of this
is obviously user visible, but does make sense in that it maintains
semantics after the round-down wrt 0 address and mmap.
Passes shm related ltp tests.

mm, vmscan: consider eligible zones in get\_scan\_count
commit 71ab6cfe88dcf9f6e6a65eb85cf2bda20a257682 upstream.
get\_scan\_count() considers the whole node LRU size when
- doing SCAN\_FILE due to many page cache inactive pages
- calculating the number of pages to scan
In both cases this might lead to unexpected behavior especially on 32b
systems where we can expect lowmem memory pressure very often.
A large highmem zone can easily distort SCAN\_FILE heuristic because
there might be only few file pages from the eligible zones on the node
lru and we would still enforce file lru scanning which can lead to
trashing while we could still scan anonymous pages.
The later use of lruvec\_lru\_size can be problematic as well. Especially
when there are not many pages from the eligible zones. We would have to
skip over many pages to find anything to reclaim but shrink\_node\_memcg
would only reduce the remaining number to scan by SWAP\_CLUSTER\_MAX at
maximum. Therefore we can end up going over a large LRU many times
without actually having chance to reclaim much if anything at all. The
closer we are out of memory on lowmem zone the worse the problem will
be.
Fix this by filtering out all the ineligible zones when calculating the
lru size for both paths and consider only sc->reclaim\_idx zones.
The patch would need to be tweaked a bit to apply to 4.10 and older but
I will do that as soon as it hits the Linus tree in the next merge
window.

mm: do not access page->mapping directly on page\_endio
commit dd8416c47715cf324c9a16f13273f9fda87acfed upstream.
With rw\_page, page\_endio is used for completing IO on a page and it
propagates write error to the address space if the IO fails. The
problem is it accesses page->mapping directly which might be okay for
file-backed pages but it shouldn't for anonymous page. Otherwise, it
can corrupt one of field from anon\_vma under us and system goes panic
randomly.
swap\_writepage
bdev\_writepage
ops->rw\_page
I encountered the BUG during developing new zram feature and it was
really hard to figure it out because it made random crash, somtime
mmap\_sem lockdep, sometime other places where places never related to
zram/zsmalloc, and not reproducible with some configuration.
When I consider how that bug is subtle and people do fast-swap test with
brd, it's worth to add stable mark, I think.

commit e1587a4945408faa58d0485002c110eb2454740c upstream.
At the end of a window period, if the reclaimed pages is greater than
scanned, an unsigned underflow can result in a huge pressure value and
thus a critical event. Reclaimed pages is found to go higher than
scanned because of the addition of reclaimed slab pages to reclaimed in
shrink\_node without a corresponding increment to scanned pages.
Minchan Kim mentioned that this can also happen in the case of a THP
page where the scanned is 1 and reclaimed could be 512.

mm/page\_alloc: fix nodes for reclaim in fast path
commit e02dc017c3032dcdce1b993af0db135462e1b4b7 upstream.
When @node\_reclaim\_node isn't 0, the page allocator tries to reclaim
pages if the amount of free memory in the zones are below the low
watermark. On Power platform, none of NUMA nodes are scanned for page
reclaim because no nodes match the condition in zone\_allows\_reclaim().
On Power platform, RECLAIM\_DISTANCE is set to 10 which is the distance
of Node-A to Node-A. So the preferred node even won't be scanned for
page reclaim.
\_\_alloc\_pages\_nodemask()
get\_page\_from\_freelist()
zone\_allows\_reclaim()
Anton proposed the test code as below:
# cat alloc.c
:
int main(int argc, char \*argv[])
{
void \*p;
unsigned long size;
unsigned long start, end;
start = time(NULL);
size = strtoul(argv[1], NULL, 0);
printf("To allocate %ldGB memory\n", size);
size <<= 30;
p = malloc(size);
assert(p);
memset(p, 0, size);
end = time(NULL);
printf("Used time: %ld seconds\n", end - start);
sleep(3600);
return 0;
}
The system I use for testing has two NUMA nodes. Both have 128GB
memory. In below scnario, the page caches on node#0 should be reclaimed
when it encounters pressure to accommodate request of allocation.
# echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/zone\_reclaim\_mode; \
sync; \
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches; \
# taskset -c 0 cat file.32G > /dev/null; \
grep FilePages /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
Node 0 FilePages: 33619712 kB
# taskset -c 0 ./alloc 128

Node 0 FilePages: 33619840 kB
# grep MemFree /sys/devices/system/node/node0/meminfo
Node 0 MemFree: 186816 kB
With the patch applied, the pagecache on node-0 is reclaimed when its
free memory is running out. It's the expected behaviour.
# echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/zone\_reclaim\_mode; \
sync; \
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches
# taskset -c 0 cat file.32G > /dev/null; \

The mem\_hotplug\_{begin,done} lock coordinates with {get,put}\_online\_mems()

corrupting mem\_hotplug.refcount and missed wakeups / soft lockups.

CIFS: Fix splice read for non-cached files

Currently we call copy\_page\_to\_iter() for uncached reading into a pipe.
This is wrong because it treats pages as VFS cache pages and copies references
rather than actual data. When we are trying to read from the pipe we end up
calling page\_cache\_pipe\_buf\_confirm() which returns -ENODATA. This error
is translated into 0 which is returned to a user.
This issue is reproduced by running xfs-tests suite (generic test #249)
against mount points with "cache=none". Fix it by mapping pages manually
and calling copy\_to\_iter() that copies data into the pipe.

tpm\_tis: use default timeout value if chip reports it as zero
commit 1d70fe9d9c3a4c627f9757cbba5d628687b121c1 upstream.
Since commit 1107d065fdf1 ("tpm\_tis: Introduce intermediate layer for
TPM access") Atmel 3203 TPM on ThinkPad X61S (TPM firmware version 13.9)
no longer works. The initialization proceeds fine until we get and
start using chip-reported timeouts - and the chip reports C and D
timeouts of zero.
It turns out that until commit 8e54caf407b98e ("tpm: Provide a generic
means to override the chip returned timeouts") we had actually let
default timeout values remain in this case, so let's bring back this
behavior to make chips like Atmel 3203 work again.
Use a common code that was introduced by that commit so a warning is
printed in this case and /sys/class/tpm/tpm\*/timeouts correctly says the
timeouts aren't chip-original.

regulator: Fix regulator\_summary for deviceless consumers
commit e42a46b6f52473661ad192f76a128a68fe301df4 upstream.
It is allowed to call regulator\_get with a NULL dev argument
(\_regulator\_get explicitly checks for it) but this causes an error later
when printing /sys/kernel/debug/regulator\_summary.
Fix this by explicitly handling "deviceless" consumers in the debugfs code.

coresight: fix kernel panic caused by invalid CPU
commit f09444639099584bc4784dfcd85ada67c6f33e0f upstream.
Commit d52c9750f150 ("coresight: reset "enable\_sink" flag when need be")
caused a kernel panic because of the using of an invalid value: after
'for\_each\_cpu(cpu, mask)', value of local variable 'cpu' become invalid,
causes following 'cpu\_to\_node' access invalid memory area.
This patch brings the deleted 'cpu = cpumask\_first(mask)' back.

coresight: STM: Balance enable/disable
commit 4474f4c40a9c607c7317e686b23619b7b768004f upstream.
The stm is automatically enabled when an application sets the policy
via ->link() call back by using coresight\_enable(), which keeps the
refcount of the current users of the STM. However, the unlink() callback
issues stm\_disable() directly, which leaves the STM turned off, without
the coresight layer knowing about it. This prevents any further uses
of the STM hardware as the coresight layer still thinks the STM is
turned on and doesn't enable the hardware when required. Even manually
enabling the STM via sysfs can't really enable the hw.
e.g,
$ echo 1 > $CS\_DEVS/$ETR/enable\_sink
$ mkdir -p $CONFIG\_FS/stp-policy/$source.0/stm\_test/
$ echo 32768 65535 > $CONFIG\_FS/stp-policy/$source.0/stm\_test/channels

staging: rtl: fix possible NULL pointer dereference
commit 6e017006022abfea5d2466cad936065f45763ad1 upstream.
gcc-7 detects that wlanhdr\_to\_ethhdr() in two drivers calls memcpy() with
a destination argument that an earlier function call may have set to NULL:
staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw\_recv.c: In function 'wlanhdr\_to\_ethhdr':
staging/rtl8188eu/core/rtw\_recv.c:1318:2: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]
staging/rtl8712/rtl871x\_recv.c: In function 'r8712\_wlanhdr\_to\_ethhdr':
staging/rtl8712/rtl871x\_recv.c:649:2: warning: argument 1 null where non-null expected [-Wnonnull]
I'm fixing this by adding a NULL pointer check and returning failure
from the function, which is hopefully already handled properly.
This seems to date back to when the drivers were originally added,
so backporting the fix to stable seems appropriate. There are other
related realtek drivers in the kernel, but none of them contain a
function with a similar name or produce this warning.

staging: greybus: loopback: fix broken udelay
commit 33b8807a6fe10d0e675e0704444373a6fad93188 upstream.
The loopback driver allows the user to set a minimum delay of up to one
second to be inserted between test iterations (i.e. request
submissions). The delay is currently specified in microseconds and is
implemented using udelay.
Busy looping for long periods is not just anti-social; udelay must not
be used for delays longer than a few milliseconds due to the risk of
integer overflow.
Replace the broken udelay with a usleep\_range with a 100 us range for
short delays (< 20 ms) and otherwise revert to using msleep.

With the new PWM control, pwm polarity for pwm control 4..6 is specified

ALSA: seq: Fix link corruption by event error handling
commit f3ac9f737603da80c2da3e84b89e74429836bb6d upstream.
The sequencer FIFO management has a bug that may lead to a corruption
(shortage) of the cell linked list. When a sequencer client faces an
error at the event delivery, it tries to put back the dequeued cell.
When the first queue was put back, this forgot the tail pointer
tracking, and the link will be screwed up.
Although there is no memory corruption, the sequencer client may stall
forever at exit while flushing the pending FIFO cells in
snd\_seq\_pool\_done(), as spotted by syzkaller.
This patch addresses the missing tail pointer tracking at
snd\_seq\_fifo\_cell\_putback(). Also the patch makes sure to clear the
cell->enxt pointer at snd\_seq\_fifo\_event\_in() for avoiding a similar
mess-up of the FIFO linked list.

When a user sets a too small ticks with a fine-grained timer like
hrtimer, the kernel tries to fire up the timer irq too frequently.
This may lead to the condensed locks, eventually the kernel spinlock
lockup with warnings.
For avoiding such a situation, we define a lower limit of the
resolution, namely 1ms. When the user passes a too small tick value
that results in less than that, the kernel returns -EINVAL now.

media: Properly pass through media entity types in entity enumeration
commit 98d85f3cb912fde14593ead54dea4c1a00b3966f upstream.
When the functions replaced media entity types, the range which was
allowed for the types was incorrect. This meant that media entity types
for specific devices were not passed correctly to the userspace through
MEDIA\_IOC\_ENUM\_ENTITIES. Fix it.

am437x-vpfe: always assign bpp variable

In vpfe\_s\_fmt(), when the sensor format and the requested format were

Grab the bpp value that is currently used by using \_\_vpfe\_get\_format()
instead of its wrapper, vpfe\_try\_fmt().
This use of uninitialized variable has been found by compiling the
kernel with clang.

MIPS: Calculate microMIPS ra properly when unwinding the stack
commit bb9bc4689b9c635714fbcd5d335bad9934a7ebfc upstream.
get\_frame\_info() calculates the offset of the return address within a
stack frame simply by dividing a the bottom 16 bits of the instruction,
treated as a signed integer, by the size of a long. Whilst this works
for MIPS32 & MIPS64 ISAs where the sw or sd instructions are used, it's
incorrect for microMIPS where encodings differ. The result is that we
typically completely fail to unwind the stack on microMIPS.
Fix this by adjusting is\_ra\_save\_ins() to calculate the return address
offset, and take into account the various different encodings there in
the same place as we consider whether an instruction is storing the
ra/$31 register.
With this we are now able to unwind the stack for kernels targetting the
microMIPS ISA, for example we can produce:

MIPS: Fix get\_frame\_info() handling of microMIPS function size
commit b6c7a324df37bf05ef7a2c1580683cf10d082d97 upstream.
get\_frame\_info() is meant to iterate over up to the first 128
instructions within a function, but for microMIPS kernels it will not
reach that many instructions unless the function is 512 bytes long since
we calculate the maximum number of instructions to check by dividing the
function length by the 4 byte size of a union mips\_instruction. In
microMIPS kernels this won't do since instructions are variable length.
Fix this by instead checking whether the pointer to the current
instruction has reached the end of the function, and use max\_insns as a
simple constant to check the number of iterations against.

MIPS: Prevent unaligned accesses during stack unwinding
commit a3552dace7d1d0cabf573e88fc3025cb90c4a601 upstream.
During stack unwinding we call a number of functions to determine what
type of instruction we're looking at. The union mips\_instruction pointer
provided to them may be pointing at a 2 byte, but not 4 byte, aligned
address & we thus cannot directly access the 4 byte wide members of the
union mips\_instruction. To avoid this is\_ra\_save\_ins() copies the
required half-words of the microMIPS instruction to a correctly aligned
union mips\_instruction on the stack, which it can then access safely.
The is\_jump\_ins() & is\_sp\_move\_ins() functions do not correctly perform
this temporary copy, and instead attempt to directly dereference 4 byte
fields which may be misaligned and lead to an address exception.
Fix this by copying the instruction halfwords to a temporary union
mips\_instruction in get\_frame\_info() such that we can provide a 4 byte
aligned union mips\_instruction to the is\_\*\_ins() functions and they do
not need to deal with misalignment themselves.

MIPS: Clear ISA bit correctly in get\_frame\_info()
commit ccaf7caf2c73c6db920772bf08bf1d47b2170634 upstream.
get\_frame\_info() can be called in microMIPS kernels with the ISA bit
already clear. For example this happens when unwind\_stack\_by\_address()
is called because we begin with a PC that has the ISA bit set & subtract
the (odd) offset from the preceding symbol (which does not have the ISA
bit set). Since get\_frame\_info() unconditionally subtracts 1 from the PC
in microMIPS kernels it incorrectly misaligns the address it then
attempts to access code at, leading to an address error exception.
Fix this by using msk\_isa16\_mode() to clear the ISA bit, which allows
get\_frame\_info() to function regardless of whether it is provided with a
PC that has the ISA bit set or not.

MIPS: Lantiq: Keep ethernet enabled during boot
commit 774f0c6419bb8f9d83901d33582c7fe3ba6a6cb3 upstream.
Disabling ethernet during reboot (only to enable it again when the
ethernet driver attaches) can put the chip into a faulty state where it
corrupts the header of all incoming packets.
This happens if packets arrive during the time window where the core is
disabled, and it can be easily reproduced by rebooting while sending a
flood ping to the broadcast address.

MIPS: OCTEON: Fix copy\_from\_user fault handling for large buffers
commit 884b426917e4b3c85f33b382c792a94305dfdd62 upstream.
If copy\_from\_user is called with a large buffer (>= 128 bytes) and the
userspace buffer refers partially to unreadable memory, then it is
possible for Octeon's copy\_from\_user to report the wrong number of bytes
have been copied. In the case where the buffer size is an exact multiple
of 128 and the fault occurs in the last 64 bytes, copy\_from\_user will
report that all the bytes were copied successfully but leave some
garbage in the destination buffer.
The bug is in the main \_\_copy\_user\_common loop in octeon-memcpy.S where
in the middle of the loop, src and dst are incremented by 128 bytes. The
l\_exc\_copy fault handler is used after this but that assumes that
"src < THREAD\_BUADDR($28)". This is not the case if src has already been
incremented.
Fix by adding an extra fault handler which rewinds the src and dst
pointers 128 bytes before falling though to l\_exc\_copy.
Thanks to the pwritev test from the strace test suite for originally
highlighting this bug!

MIPS: Fix special case in 64 bit IP checksumming.
commit 66fd848cadaa6be974a8c780fbeb328f0af4d3bd upstream.
For certain arguments such as saddr = 0xc0a8fd60, daddr = 0xc0a8fda1,
len = 80, proto = 17, sum = 0x7eae049d there will be a carry when
folding the intermediate 64 bit checksum to 32 bit but the code doesn't
add the carry back to the one's complement sum, thus an incorrect result
will be generated.
