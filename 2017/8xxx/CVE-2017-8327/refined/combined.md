| [Description](#c0)  Marcos González    2004-08-26 06:13:24 UTC  ``` The quake2-icculus ebuild copies the game386.so files in /usr/games/lib/quake2-icculus/blah but they should be installed in /usr/share/games/quake2-data/blah. If you copy by hand each specific game386.so file to the respective folder (i.e. quake2-data/xatrix/), they will be used (I have tried xatrix and rogue expansion packs and now the extra items appear, (i.e. double damage), as before only the basic game386.so was used and those items didn't appear).  There is also a fix to the "quake2 segfaulting when entering video options menu": copying the ref_*.so files from /usr/games/lib/quake2-icculus/ to /usr/share/games/quake2-data/.  These fixes were talked here (my nick is MaxDamage): <http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=199599&highlight=quake2+segfault>  This surely closes [bug #42389](show_bug.cgi?id=42389 "RESOLVED FIXED - quake2-icculus and quake2-data: quake2 does not load the ctf mod when executing \"game ctf\"") [http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42389](show_bug.cgi?id=42389 "RESOLVED FIXED - quake2-icculus and quake2-data: quake2 does not load the ctf mod when executing \"game ctf\"")  I opened a new bug because of the video menu extra information. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-26 06:46:23 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [60752](show_bug.cgi?id=60752 "RESOLVED FIXED - quake2 \"entering video menu\" crash") *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-27 06:46:56 UTC  ``` Working ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-27 07:45:07 UTC  ``` Fixed in CVS ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Paul Oldham    2004-11-30 11:27:36 UTC  ``` The fix for the "quake2 segfaulting when entering video options menu" bug described above is still required, even with quake2-icculus-0.15-r2 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-30 11:35:46 UTC  ``` Paul: why not look at the bug for that problem rather than this one?  Bug # is 60792  *Hint to everyone* always file a separate bug for each problem for this exact reason. ``` |  |
