  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `join_pthread` function within `stream.c`. This is triggered during the decompression process when handling a crafted archive file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "NULL pointer dereference in `join_pthread` function"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) condition, causing the program to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted archive file using `lrzip`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious archive file and entice a user to decompress it."
