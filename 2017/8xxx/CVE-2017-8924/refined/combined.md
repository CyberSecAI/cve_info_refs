Add missing sanity check to the bulk-in completion handler to avoid an
integer underflow that can be triggered by a malicious device.

This avoids leaking 128 kB of memory content from after the URB transfer
buffer to user space.

                 CVE-2017-9242 CVE-2017-1000364

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-0605

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the trace subsystem.

CVE-2017-7487

    Li Qiang reported a reference counter leak in the ipxitf_ioctl
    function which may result into a use-after-free vulnerability,
    triggerable when a IPX interface is configured.

CVE-2017-7645

    Tuomas Haanpaa and Matti Kamunen from Synopsys Ltd discovered that
    the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations are vulnerable to an
    out-of-bounds memory access issue while processing arbitrarily long
    arguments sent by NFSv2/NFSv3 PRC clients, leading to a denial of
    service.

CVE-2017-7895

    Ari Kauppi from Synopsys Ltd discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3
    server implementations do not properly handle payload bounds
    checking of WRITE requests. A remote attacker with write access to a
    NFS mount can take advantage of this flaw to read chunks of
    arbitrary memory from both kernel-space and user-space.

CVE-2017-8064

    Arnd Bergmann found that the DVB-USB core misused the device
    logging system, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability, with
    unknown security impact.

CVE-2017-8890

    It was discovered that the net_csk_clone_lock() function allows a
    remote attacker to cause a double free leading to a denial of
    service or potentially have other impact.

CVE-2017-8924

    Johan Hovold found that the io_ti USB serial driver could leak
    sensitive information if a malicious USB device was connected.

CVE-2017-8925

    Johan Hovold found a reference counter leak in the omninet USB
    serial driver, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.  This
    can be triggered by a local user permitted to open tty devices.

CVE-2017-9074

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the IPv6 fragmentation
    implementation could read beyond the end of a packet buffer.  A
    local user or guest VM might be able to use this to leak sensitive
    information or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-9075

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the SCTP/IPv6 implementation
    wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, resulting
    in a use-after-free vulnerability, a similar issue to
    CVE-2017-8890.  This can be triggered by any local user.

CVE-2017-9076 / CVE-2017-9077

    Cong Wang found that the TCP/IPv6 and DCCP/IPv6 implementations
    wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, a similar
    issue to CVE-2017-9075.

CVE-2017-9242

    Andrey Konovalov reported a packet buffer overrun in the IPv6
    implementation.  A local user could use this for denial of service
    (memory corruption; crash) and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-1000364

    The Qualys Research Labs discovered that the size of the stack guard
    page is not sufficiently large. The stack-pointer can jump over the
    guard-page and moving from the stack into another memory region
    without accessing the guard-page. In this case no page-fault
    exception is raised and the stack extends into the other memory
    region. An attacker can exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.

    The default stack gap protection is set to 256 pages and can be
    configured via the stack_guard_gap kernel parameter on the kernel
    command line.

    Further details can be found at
    <https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt>

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u1 or earlier versions before the stretch release.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

commit 45bded2c216da6010184ac5ebe88c27f73439009 upstream.
Make sure that the Q counters are supported by the FW before trying
to allocate/deallocte them, this will avoid driver load failure when
they aren't supported by the FW.

The problem is that when the kernel tries to truncate an inode in
ext4\_truncate(), it tries to clear any on-disk data beyond i\_size.
Without the encryption key, it can't do that, and so it triggers a
BUG.
E2fsck does \*not\* provide this service, and in practice most file
systems have their orphan list processed by e2fsck, so to avoid
crashing, this patch skips this step if we don't have access to the
encryption key (which is the case when processing the orphan list; in
all other cases, we will have the encryption key, or the kernel
wouldn't have allowed the file to be opened).
An open question is whether the fact that e2fsck isn't clearing the
bytes beyond i\_size causing problems --- and if we've lived with it
not doing it for so long, can we drop this from the kernel replay of
the orphan list in all cases (not just when we don't have the key for
encrypted inodes).

dm: flush queued bios when process blocks to avoid deadlock
commit d67a5f4b5947aba4bfe9a80a2b86079c215ca755 upstream.
Commit df2cb6daa4 ("block: Avoid deadlocks with bio allocation by
stacking drivers") created a workqueue for every bio set and code
in bio\_alloc\_bioset() that tries to resolve some low-memory deadlocks
by redirecting bios queued on current->bio\_list to the workqueue if the
system is low on memory. However other deadlocks (see below \*\*) may
happen, without any low memory condition, because generic\_make\_request
is queuing bios to current->bio\_list (rather than submitting them).
\*\* the related dm-snapshot deadlock is detailed here:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2016-July/msg00065.html
Fix this deadlock by redirecting any bios on current->bio\_list to the
bio\_set's rescue workqueue on every schedule() call. Consequently,
when the process blocks on a mutex, the bios queued on
current->bio\_list are dispatched to independent workqueus and they can
complete without waiting for the mutex to be available.
The structure blk\_plug contains an entry cb\_list and this list can contain
arbitrary callback functions that are called when the process blocks.
To implement this fix DM (ab)uses the onstack plug's cb\_list interface
to get its flush\_current\_bio\_list() called at schedule() time.
This fixes the snapshot deadlock - if the map method blocks,
flush\_current\_bio\_list() will be called and it redirects bios waiting
on current->bio\_list to appropriate workqueues.

drm/i915/gvt: Fix superfluous newline in GVT\_DISPLAY\_READY env var
commit d8e9b2b9097c117880dc22933239d05199c60b96 upstream.
send\_display\_send\_uevent() sends two environment variable, and the
first one GVT\_DISPLAY\_READY is set including a new line at the end of
the string; that is obviously superfluous and wrong -- at least, it
\*looks\* so when you only read the code.
However, it doesn't appear in the actual output by a (supposedly
unexpected) trick. The code uses snprintf() and truncates the string
in size 20 bytes. This makes the string as GVT\_DISPLAY\_READY=0 or
...=1 including the trailing NUL-letter. That is, the '\n' found in
the format string is always cut off as a result.
Although the code gives the correct result, it is confusing. This
patch addresses it, just removing the superfluous '\n' from the format
string for avoiding further confusion. If the argument "ready" were
not a bool, the size 20 should be corrected as well. But it's a
bool, so we can leave the magic number 20 as is for now.
FWIW, the bug was spotted by a new GCC7 warning:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/handlers.c: In function 'pvinfo\_mmio\_write':
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/handlers.c:1042:34: error: 'snprintf' output truncated before the last format character [-Werror=format-truncation=]

Currently, if a vcpu thread tries to change the active state of an
interrupt which is already on the same vcpu's AP list, it will loop
forever. Since the VGIC mmio handler is called after a vcpu has
already synced back the LR state to the struct vgic\_irq, we can just

While we can technically not run huge page guests right now, we can
setup a guest with huge pages. Trying to migrate it will trigger a
VM\_BUG\_ON and, if the kernel is not configured to panic on a BUG, it
will happily try to work on non-existing page table entries.
With this patch, we always return "dirty" if we encounter a large page
when migrating. This at least fixes the immediate problem until we
have proper handling for both kind of pages.

usb: host: xhci-plat: Fix timeout on removal of hot pluggable xhci controllers
commit dcc7620cad5ad1326a78f4031a7bf4f0e5b42984 upstream.
Upstream commit 98d74f9ceaef ("xhci: fix 10 second timeout on removal of
PCI hotpluggable xhci controllers") fixes a problem with hot pluggable PCI
xhci controllers which can result in excessive timeouts, to the point where
the system reports a deadlock.
The same problem is seen with hot pluggable xhci controllers using the
xhci-plat driver, such as the driver used for Type-C ports on rk3399.
Similar to hot-pluggable PCI controllers, the driver for this chip
removes the xhci controller from the system when the Type-C cable is
disconnected.
The solution for PCI devices works just as well for non-PCI devices
and avoids the problem.

usb: dwc3: gadget: make Set Endpoint Configuration macros safe
commit 7369090a9fb57c3fc705ce355d2e4523a5a24716 upstream.
Some gadget drivers are bad, bad boys. We notice
that ADB was passing bad Burst Size which caused top
bits of param0 to be overwritten which confused DWC3
when running this command.
In order to avoid future issues, we're going to make
sure values passed by macros are always safe for the
controller. Note that ADB still needs a fix to \*not\*

powerpc/xics: Work around limitations of OPAL XICS priority handling
commit a69e2fb70350a66f91175cd2625f1e8215c5b6e9 upstream.
The CPPR (Current Processor Priority Register) of a XICS interrupt
presentation controller contains a value N, such that only interrupts
with a priority "more favoured" than N will be received by the CPU,
where "more favoured" means "less than". So if the CPPR has the value 5
then only interrupts with a priority of 0-4 inclusive will be received.
In theory the CPPR can support a value of 0 to 255 inclusive.
In practice Linux only uses values of 0, 4, 5 and 0xff. Setting the CPPR
to 0 rejects all interrupts, setting it to 0xff allows all interrupts.
The values 4 and 5 are used to differentiate IPIs from external
interrupts. Setting the CPPR to 5 allows IPIs to be received but not
external interrupts.
The CPPR emulation in the OPAL XICS implementation only directly
supports priorities 0 and 0xff. All other priorities are considered
equivalent, and mapped to a single priority value internally. This means
when using icp-opal we can not allow IPIs but not externals.
This breaks Linux's use of priority values when a CPU is hot unplugged.
After migrating IRQs away from the CPU that is being offlined, we set
the priority to 5, meaning we still want the offline CPU to receive
IPIs. But the effect of the OPAL XICS emulation's use of a single
priority value is that all interrupts are rejected by the CPU. With the
CPU offline, and not receiving IPIs, we may not be able to wake it up to
bring it back online.
The first part of the fix is in icp\_opal\_set\_cpu\_priority(). CPPR values
of 0 to 4 inclusive will correctly cause all interrupts to be rejected,
so we pass those CPPR values through to OPAL. However if we are called
with a CPPR of 5 or greater, the caller is expecting to be able to allow
IPIs but not external interrupts. We know this doesn't work, so instead
of rejecting all interrupts we choose the opposite which is to allow all
interrupts. This is still not correct behaviour, but we know for the
only existing caller (xics\_migrate\_irqs\_away()), that it is the better
option.
The other part of the fix is in xics\_migrate\_irqs\_away(). Instead of
setting priority (CPPR) to 0, and then back to 5 before migrating IRQs,
we migrate the IRQs before setting the priority back to 5. This should
have no effect on an ICP backend with a working set\_priority(), and on
icp-opal it means we will keep all interrupts blocked until after we've
finished doing the IRQ migration. Additionally we wait for 5ms after
doing the migration to make sure there are no IRQs in flight.

powerpc/booke: Fix boot crash due to null hugepd

This impacts all nxp (ex-freescale) 32-bit booke platforms.
This was caused by the change of hugepd\_t.pd from signed to unsigned,
and the update to the nohash version of hugepd\_ok(). Previously
hugepd\_ok() could exclude all non-huge and NULL pgds using > 0, whereas
now we need to explicitly check that the value is not zero and also that
PD\_HUGE is \*clear\*.
This isn't protected by the pgd\_none() check in \_\_find\_linux\_pte\_or\_hugepte()
because on 32-bit we use pgtable-nopud.h, which causes the pgd\_none()
check to be always false.

dw2102: don't do DMA on stack
commit 606142af57dad981b78707234cfbd15f9f7b7125 upstream.
On Kernel 4.9, WARNINGs about doing DMA on stack are hit at
the dw2102 driver: one in su3000\_power\_ctrl() and the other in tt\_s2\_4600\_frontend\_attach().
Both were due to the use of buffers on the stack as parameters to
dvb\_usb\_generic\_rw() and the resulting attempt to do DMA with them.
The device was non-functional as a result.
So, switch this driver over to use a buffer within the device state
structure, as has been done with other DVB-USB drivers.
Tested with TechnoTrend TT-connect S2-4600.

efi/arm: Fix boot crash with CONFIG\_CPUMASK\_OFFSTACK=y
commit d1eb98143c56f24fef125f5bbed49ae0b52fb7d6 upstream.
On ARM and arm64, we use a dedicated mm\_struct to map the UEFI
Runtime Services regions, which allows us to map those regions
on demand, and in a way that is guaranteed to be compatible
with incoming kernels across kexec.
As it turns out, we don't fully initialize the mm\_struct in the
same way as process mm\_structs are initialized on fork(), which
results in the following crash on ARM if CONFIG\_CPUMASK\_OFFSTACK=y
is enabled:
...

ucount: Remove the atomicity from ucount->count
commit 040757f738e13caaa9c5078bca79aa97e11dde88 upstream.
Always increment/decrement ucount->count under the ucounts\_lock. The
increments are there already and moving the decrements there means the
locking logic of the code is simpler. This simplification in the
locking logic fixes a race between put\_ucounts and get\_ucounts that
could result in a use-after-free because the count could go zero then
be found by get\_ucounts and then be freed by put\_ucounts.
A bug presumably this one was found by a combination of syzkaller and
KASAN. JongWhan Kim reported the syzkaller failure and Dmitry Vyukov
spotted the race in the code.

Include several of them in the same .c file (as I currently have in

Every other include file in include/trace/events/ avoids that issue
by having a #undef TRACE\_INCLUDE\_FILE before the #define; syscalls.h

Since commit e2474541032d ("bcm2835: Fix hang for writing messages
larger than 16 bytes") the interrupt handler is prone to a possible
NULL pointer dereference. This could happen if an interrupt fires
before curr\_msg is set by bcm2835\_i2c\_xfer\_msg() and randomly occurs
on the RPi 3. Even this is an unexpected behavior the driver must
handle that with an error instead of a crash.

commit 886f9c69fc68f56ddea34d3de51ac1fc2ac8dfbc upstream.
All pointers to these functions were removed, so now they produce
warnings:
arch/mips/ralink/rt305x.c:92:13: error: 'rt305x\_wdt\_reset' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
This removes the functions. If we need them again, the patch can be
reverted later.

MIPS: ip22: Fix ip28 build for modern gcc
commit 23ca9b522383d3b9b7991d8586db30118992af4a upstream.
kernelci reports a failure of the ip28\_defconfig build after upgrading its
gcc version:
arch/mips/sgi-ip22/Platform:29: \*\*\* gcc doesn't support needed option -mr10k-cache-barrier=store. Stop.
The problem apparently is that the -mr10k-cache-barrier=store option is now
rejected for CPUs other than r10k. Explicitly including the CPU in the
check fixes this and is safe because both options were introduced in
gcc-4.4.

MIPS: ip27: Disable qlge driver in defconfig
commit b617649468390713db1515ea79fc772d2eb897a8 upstream.
One of the last remaining failures in kernelci.org is for a gcc bug:
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qlge/qlge\_main.c:4819:1: error: insn does not satisfy its constraints:
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qlge/qlge\_main.c:4819:1: internal compiler error: in extract\_constrain\_insn, at recog.c:2190
This is apparently broken in gcc-6 but fixed in gcc-7, and I cannot
reproduce the problem here. However, it is clear that ip27\_defconfig
does not actually need this driver as the platform has only PCI-X but
not PCIe, and the qlge adapter in turn is PCIe-only.
The driver was originally enabled in 2010 along with lots of other
drivers.

MIPS: VDSO: avoid duplicate CAC\_BASE definition
commit 1742ac265046f34223e06d5d283496f0291be259 upstream.
vdso.h includes  implicitly after defining CONFIG\_32BITS.
This defeats the override in mach-ip27/spaces.h, leading to
a build error that shows up in kernelci.org:
In file included from arch/mips/include/asm/mach-ip27/spaces.h:29:0,
from arch/mips/include/asm/page.h:12,
from arch/mips/vdso/vdso.h:26,
from arch/mips/vdso/gettimeofday.c:11:
arch/mips/include/asm/mach-generic/spaces.h:28:0: error: "CAC\_BASE" redefined [-Werror]
#define CAC\_BASE \_AC(0x80000000, UL)
An earlier patch tried to make the second definition conditional,
but that patch had the #ifdef in the wrong place, and would lead
to another warning:
arch/mips/include/asm/io.h: In function 'phys\_to\_virt':
arch/mips/include/asm/io.h:138:9: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]
For all I can tell, there is no other reason than vdso32 to ever
include this file with CONFIG\_32BITS set, and the vdso itself should
never refer to the base addresses as it is running in user space,
so adding an #ifdef here is safe.

crypto: improve gcc optimization flags for serpent and wp512
commit 7d6e9105026788c497f0ab32fa16c82f4ab5ff61 upstream.
An ancient gcc bug (first reported in 2003) has apparently resurfaced
on MIPS, where kernelci.org reports an overly large stack frame in the
whirlpool hash algorithm:
crypto/wp512.c:987:1: warning: the frame size of 1112 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
With some testing in different configurations, I'm seeing large
variations in stack frames size up to 1500 bytes for what should have
around 300 bytes at most. I also checked the reference implementation,
which is essentially the same code but also comes with some test and
benchmarking infrastructure.
It seems that recent compiler versions on at least arm, arm64 and powerpc
have a partial fix for this problem, but enabling "-fsched-pressure", but
even with that fix they suffer from the issue to a certain degree. Some
testing on arm64 shows that the time needed to hash a given amount of
data is roughly proportional to the stack frame size here, which makes
sense given that the wp512 implementation is doing lots of loads for
table lookups, and the problem with the overly large stack is a result
of doing a lot more loads and stores for spilled registers (as seen from
inspecting the object code).
Disabling -fschedule-insns consistently fixes the problem for wp512,
in my collection of cross-compilers, the results are consistently better
or identical when comparing the stack sizes in this function, though
some architectures (notable x86) have schedule-insns disabled by
default.
The four columns are:
default: -O2
press: -O2 -fsched-pressure
nopress: -O2 -fschedule-insns -fno-sched-pressure
nosched: -O2 -no-schedule-insns (disables sched-pressure)

I did not do any runtime tests with serpent, so it is possible that stack
frame size does not directly correlate with runtime performance here and
it actually makes things worse, but it's more likely to help here, and
the reduced stack frame size is probably enough reason to apply the patch,
especially given that the crypto code is often used in deep call chains.

specifically led to modem-status changes going unnoticed, effectively
breaking TIOCMGET.
Note that the offending commit fixes a loop-condition underflow and is
