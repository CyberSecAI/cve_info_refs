Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper parsing of XML content within Microsoft Management Console (MMC) .msc files. Specifically, the software doesn't correctly handle references to external entities in the XML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an XXE injection flaw. This allows an attacker to include a reference to an external entity in a specially crafted .msc file, which the vulnerable MMC software will attempt to resolve. This can lead to various exploits.
- **Filter or Protection Mechanism Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass normal parsing mechanisms by exploiting the XXE vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** A successful XXE attack allows an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data from the targeted system. This could include files, environment variables, etc.
- **Computer System Compromise:** By exfiltrating sensitive data or potentially by other actions (not specified in this content) through XXE, an attacker can gain a stronger foothold on the system, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although the document doesn't explicitly state arbitrary code execution, the ability to include and reference external entities can create opportunities for further exploitation, that can lead to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted .msc Files:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted .msc files containing malicious XML content that includes external entity references.
- **Social Engineering:** Exploitation typically requires social engineering to trick a user into opening the malicious .msc file. This could include phishing, using shared network drives or USBs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs an authenticated user to open the malicious .msc file, but they don't require any special permissions on the target system.
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through social engineering attacks using email or file shares. It can also be exploited via USB or HID attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
- The vulnerability was discovered in 2017.
- Microsoft addressed the vulnerability by changing how the affected software parses the XML content.
