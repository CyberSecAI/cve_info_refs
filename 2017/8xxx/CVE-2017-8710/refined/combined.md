How Antivirus Works

**How do antivirus apps and antivirus software work?**

Antivirus scans and helps remove malware files that enter a computer, tablet or smartphone. Norton AntiVirus technology uses machine learning to determine if a file is good or bad, and can do so even if it’s the first time seeing that file.

Norton protection also uses “emulation” (running each file in a lightweight virtual machine) to cause online threats to reveal themselves – this happens in milliseconds as you double-click on files on your desktop. File signature data is now stored in the cloud, and Norton protection has undergone hundreds of optimizations on the antivirus engine to minimize impacting the user experience.

## Malware Protection

Norton security technology includes multiple defenses against viruses and malware. Our technology is powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and we are part of one of the world’s largest civilian cyber intelligence networks. Our protection includes:

![](/content/dam/norton/icon/Hand-Select.svg)

**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**

Analyzes information arriving from a network (like the Internet) and helps block potential online threats before they hit your computer.

PC, Mac

![](/content/dam/norton/icon/AntiVirus-with-Advanced-Machine-Learning-44px.svg)

**AntiVirus with Advanced Machine Learning**

Scans and helps remove malware files that enter a device, using emulation to test and see what files do, and machine learning.

PC, Mac, Android

## How do you know if you have malware?

**Some types of malware “announce” themselves, while others can hide on your device**

Unlike the old days, when malware like viruses often announced themselves by displaying messages or by giving your computer the “blue screen of death,” many types of malware today can hide without producing any tell-tale symptoms of an infection. Just as different types of software perform different functions, so different types of malware can perform different jobs, whether they make themselves apparent or run on your device while hiding in the background.

Malware that you might not realize is on your device could be capturing data as you log into online accounts, finding valuable personal information stored on your device, or even turning on your webcam without your permission. This is why it’s so important to have antivirus software that recognizes and helps remove malicious software.

While many types of malware try to remain unseen, in addition to keeping up-to-date security software on your device, you can be on the lookout for some red flags that might indicate a malware infection:

* Your device slows down or gets glitchy
* Pop-up windows appear when you’re surfing
* Friends tell you they got a suspicious email from you that you definitely didn’t send
* Your smartphone battery drains quickly, or shows call/text messages you didn’t send
* Your data usage has spiked

![Small business owner using technology.](/content/dam/norton/backgrounds/small-business-owner-using-technology-mobile.jpg)

## How does malware put your computer at risk?

**What do you do online that can expose your personal or financial information? What don’t you do online these days?**

A virus doesn’t mean your computer has caught a cold. Malware can give cybercriminals access to your personal information. These days, we do many things online. Defending against malware means defending against stolen login credentials, stolen personal information, and the risk of personal information loss due to such things.

* **Entering log-in credentials**

  Some types of malware can give cybercriminals access to your usernames and passwords for accounts like your bank, online shopping, credit card accounts or email.

* **Entering financial data**

  Some malware can enable cybercriminals to obtain your credit card numbers or payment account information when you enter them online.

* **Access to email to reset passwords**

  If a cybercriminal can access your email account, they could then reset the accounts that you have connected to that email address.

## Viruses and Malware

What does Norton antivirus and security software help protect against? Today’s online threats go well beyond just viruses. AntiVirus and malware protection from Norton LifeLock helps defend against all kinds of online threats, such as:

**Viruses**

Norton protection helps block harmful software that replicates itself and spreads itself to other devices.

**Worms**

Norton protection helps block malware that replicates itself without using a host file (unlike viruses, who use a file).

**Malware**

Norton protection has defenses for various types of malicious software, including viruses, Trojans, worms, etc.

**Ransomware**

Norton protection helps protect against malware that encrypts a computer’s contents and then demands a ransom to restore them.

**Spyware**

Norton protection detects software that tracks and sends personally identifiable information or confidential information to third parties.

**Adware**

Norton protection helps block malware that’s designed to display unwanted advertisements.

**Malvertising**

Norton protection detects when malware is hidden behind online ads.

**Trojan horse**

Norton protection helps block Trojans that appear to be something they are not, often containing a backdoor component for future access.

**Phishing◊**

Norton protection has tools to detect phishing attempts, which are seemingly safe links that take users to malicious sites that gather personal data and login credentials, and can be found within websites, emails or even ads.

**Pharming**

Similar to phishing attacks, Norton protection detects pharming attacks that redirect users from a legitimate site to a malicious one.

**Browser hijacker**

Norton protection helps protect your browser against malware that changes your browser's settings, or re-directs your web traffic.

**Rootkit**

Norton protection helps protect against rookits that can enable an unauthorized user to gain control of a computer system without being detected.

**Unwanted browser extensions**

Norton Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) helps block malicious traffic caused by browser extensions.

**Banking Trojans**

Norton protection helps block and remove trojans that are known to target banking sessions.

**Coin-miner**

Norton protection helps block malware that uses someone else’s computing resources to run a coin mining script without the user’s consent (e.g. cryptojacking).

**Downloader**

Norton protection helps block online threats that call their C&C (command and control center) in order to download additional malicious payloads.

**Exploits**

Norton protection helps block specific techniques that are abused by malware to exploit a security vulnerability.

**Fileless threats**

Modern online threats leave no traces in file system by leveraging scripts and in-memory execution. Norton protection detects and helps remove them.

**Formjacking attack**

Norton protection helps block attempts to steal credit cards at online checkout.

**Keyloggers**

Norton protection helps stop online threats that attempt to steal keystrokes that you type, like when you enter your username and password for online accounts.

**Man-in-the-middle browser attacks**

Norton protection detects malware that hijacks a web session.

**PUAs**

(Potentially Unwanted Applications): Norton protection detects browser extensions or apps that are known to cause issues and uninstalls them.

**Script-based attacks**

(JavaScript, VBA, VBS, Powershell): Modern online threats use scripting languages instead of using files that are executables. Norton protection detects and helps block such attacks.

**Social Networking Scam◊**

Norton protection helps block like-jacking on Facebook, a type of clickjacking where your like actually clicks on something malicious hidden in the background, which could then be promoted to your friends.

**Tech Support Scam◊**

Norton protection helps block websites that mimic official support of organizations.

◊ Protection for phishing and online scams applies only to devices on which Norton 360 is installed. Reimbursement does not apply to identity theft loss resulting, directly or indirectly, from phishing or scams.

Antivirus for Windows®

Antivirus software for Windows computers

Norton was one of the first antivirus solutions for Windows computers, and we’ve been innovating for decades to develop new ways to help protect PCs. Today, the antivirus protection in Norton solutions uses advanced machine learning and emulation to determine whether files are good or bad, but Norton device security also has more ways to help protect your computer beyond antivirus.

Protection for PCs starts at the network-level, with Intrusion Prevention working together with the [Smart Firewall](https://uk.norton.com/feature/firewall) to analyze network traffic and help block potential online threats before they get on your computer.

The technology that powers Norton protection for PC uses Reputation Protection (Insight) to analyze reputation data, a tool that uses the reputation information gathered from our global network to classify software application files. It includes Behavioral Protection to monitor and help block applications that exhibit suspicious behavior, also based on the learnings from our huge trove of data, and tools to help protect against “zero-day” attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in applications or the operating system.

![Woman home office with laptop.](/content/dam/norton/backgrounds/woman-home-office-with-laptop-mobile.jpg)

Antivirus for Mac®

The myth that Mac computers are immune to viruses and malware is simply not true.

Mac computers can get viruses and need file-based antivirus protection. Additionally, they need the other layers of protection offered in a device security software suite such as Firewall, Intrusion Prevention and Anti-phishing Protection.

We have been helping to protect Mac computers for decades. Today, our advanced security and 24-hour threat monitoring across the globe work to outsmart cybercriminals and help stop the latest attacks before they reach your Mac.

Antivirus for iOS®

Do you need security and virus protection for iOS?

Yes! If you log into email or use public Wi-Fi, online threats may get into your iPhone® or iPad®. Your iPhone and iPad carry a lot of important information, and you use them for many different tasks. Norton protection for iOS helps protect your iPhone and iPad with Wi-Fi Security, Web Protection, and Device Security.

Wi-Fi Security helps detect and alert you if your device is connected to a Wi-Fi network that is under attack by cybercriminals, which could lead to someone else accessing your device. Web Protection helps detect and safeguard you from navigation to malicious websites, and Device Security alerts you when your operating system is out of date, which could leave your device susceptible to vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is Antivirus?

What role does antivirus software play in helping protect your devices?

Originally, antivirus scanned computer files and looked for patterns known to match computer viruses. Today, the best antivirus engines use multiple methods for identifying known and unknown online threats, and antivirus is still a foundational component of security software.

Antivirus is file-based protection, and after a virus attack, having virus-infected files on a target computer or mobile device is one of the main ways online threats remain on that device after the initial attack. Because of this, file-based protection will always be instrumental in helping detect, neutralize and remove viruses.

### What is the difference between antivirus and internet security?

Antivirus is an important part of what you might call internet security, security software or device security. A security solution includes antivirus as one of the foundations of how it helps defend against malware, but “internet security” typically refers to a software suite that has additional types of technology in addition to antivirus.

### Why is it important to have an antivirus program?

A computer, tablet or smartphone that connects to the Internet has the potential to encounter viruses and malware. While you may be careful what you do online, you could still visit a website that has been compromised with malware (without even knowing it) or download malware from a message from a trusted friend whose account was hacked. Someone else who uses your device might not be as careful as you. Having antivirus and security software for your computer or mobile device gives you protection against many types of malware that might not be easy to spot.

### How do you check for a virus on a computer?

Antivirus and security software will include a scanning function to check for viruses and malware.

### How do you get rid of a virus on your computer?

Antivirus and security software will include tools for virus and malware removal. Norton LifeLock also offers a free tool for PCs called [Norton Power Eraser](https://support.norton.com/sp/static/external/tools/npe.html) for do-it-yourself virus removal. Norton subscribers can also contact Member Services & Support if you think you have a virus or malware.

How Antivirus Works

**How do antivirus apps and antivirus software work?**

Antivirus scans and helps remove malware files that enter a computer, tablet or smartphone. Norton AntiVirus technology uses machine learning to determine if a file is good or bad, and can do so even if it’s the first time seeing that file.

Norton protection also uses “emulation” (running each file in a lightweight virtual machine) to cause online threats to reveal themselves – this happens in milliseconds as you double-click on files on your desktop. File signature data is now stored in the cloud, and Norton protection has undergone hundreds of optimizations on the antivirus engine to minimize impacting the user experience.

## Malware Protection

Norton security technology includes multiple defenses against viruses and malware. Our technology is powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and we are part of one of the world’s largest civilian cyber intelligence networks. Our protection includes:

![](/content/dam/norton/icon/Hand-Select.svg)

**Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**

Analyzes information arriving from a network (like the Internet) and helps block potential online threats before they hit your computer.

## How do you know if you have malware?

**Some types of malware “announce” themselves, while others can hide on your device**

Unlike the old days, when malware like viruses often announced themselves by displaying messages or by giving your computer the “blue screen of death,” many types of malware today can hide without producing any tell-tale symptoms of an infection. Just as different types of software perform different functions, so different types of malware can perform different jobs, whether they make themselves apparent or run on your device while hiding in the background.

Malware that you might not realize is on your device could be capturing data as you log into online accounts, finding valuable personal information stored on your device, or even turning on your webcam without your permission. This is why it’s so important to have antivirus software that recognizes and helps remove malicious software.

While many types of malware try to remain unseen, in addition to keeping up-to-date security software on your device, you can be on the lookout for some red flags that might indicate a malware infection:

* Your device slows down or gets glitchy
* Pop-up windows appear when you’re surfing
* Friends tell you they got a suspicious email from you that you definitely didn’t send
* Your smartphone battery drains quickly, or shows call/text messages you didn’t send
* Your data usage has spiked

![Small business owner using technology.](/content/dam/norton/backgrounds/small-business-owner-using-technology-mobile.jpg)

## How does malware put your computer at risk?

**What do you do online that can expose your personal or financial information? What don’t you do online these days?**

A virus doesn’t mean your computer has caught a cold. Malware can give cybercriminals access to your personal information. These days, we do many things online. Defending against malware means defending against stolen login credentials, stolen personal information, and the risk of personal information loss due to such things.

* **Entering log-in credentials**

  Some types of malware can give cybercriminals access to your usernames and passwords for accounts like your bank, online shopping, credit card accounts or email.

* **Entering financial data**

  Some malware can enable cybercriminals to obtain your credit card numbers or payment account information when you enter them online.

* **Access to email to reset passwords**

  If a cybercriminal can access your email account, they could then reset the accounts that you have connected to that email address.

## Viruses and Malware

What does Norton antivirus and security software help protect against? Today’s online threats go well beyond just viruses. AntiVirus and malware protection from Norton LifeLock helps defend against all kinds of online threats, such as:

**Viruses**

Norton protection helps block harmful software that replicates itself and spreads itself to other devices.

**Worms**

Norton protection helps block malware that replicates itself without using a host file (unlike viruses, who use a file).

**Malware**

Norton protection has defenses for various types of malicious software, including viruses, Trojans, worms, etc.

**Ransomware**

Norton protection helps protect against malware that encrypts a computer’s contents and then demands a ransom to restore them.

**Spyware**

Norton protection detects software that tracks and sends personally identifiable information or confidential information to third parties.

**Adware**

Norton protection helps block malware that’s designed to display unwanted advertisements.

**Malvertising**

Norton protection detects when malware is hidden behind online ads.

**Trojan horse**

Norton protection helps block Trojans that appear to be something they are not, often containing a backdoor component for future access.

**Phishing◊**

Norton protection has tools to detect phishing attempts, which are seemingly safe links that take users to malicious sites that gather personal data and login credentials, and can be found within websites, emails or even ads.

**Pharming**

Similar to phishing attacks, Norton protection detects pharming attacks that redirect users from a legitimate site to a malicious one.

**Browser hijacker**

Norton protection helps protect your browser against malware that changes your browser's settings, or re-directs your web traffic.

**Rootkit**

Norton protection helps protect against rookits that can enable an unauthorized user to gain control of a computer system without being detected.

**Unwanted browser extensions**

Norton Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) helps block malicious traffic caused by browser extensions.

**Banking Trojans**

Norton protection helps block and remove trojans that are known to target banking sessions.

**Coin-miner**

Norton protection helps block malware that uses someone else’s computing resources to run a coin mining script without the user’s consent (e.g. cryptojacking).

**Downloader**

Norton protection helps block online threats that call their C&C (command and control center) in order to download additional malicious payloads.

**Exploits**

Norton protection helps block specific techniques that are abused by malware to exploit a security vulnerability.

**Fileless threats**

Modern online threats leave no traces in file system by leveraging scripts and in-memory execution. Norton protection detects and helps remove them.

**Formjacking attack**

Norton protection helps block attempts to steal credit cards at online checkout.

**Keyloggers**

Norton protection helps stop online threats that attempt to steal keystrokes that you type, like when you enter your username and password for online accounts.

**Man-in-the-middle browser attacks**

Norton protection detects malware that hijacks a web session.

**PUAs**

(Potentially Unwanted Applications): Norton protection detects browser extensions or apps that are known to cause issues and uninstalls them.

**Script-based attacks**

(JavaScript, VBA, VBS, Powershell): Modern online threats use scripting languages instead of using files that are executables. Norton protection detects and helps block such attacks.

**Social Networking Scam◊**

Norton protection helps block like-jacking on Facebook, a type of clickjacking where your like actually clicks on something malicious hidden in the background, which could then be promoted to your friends.

**Tech Support Scam◊**

Norton protection helps block websites that mimic official support of organizations.

◊ Protection for phishing and online scams applies only to devices on which Norton 360 is installed. Reimbursement does not apply to identity theft loss resulting, directly or indirectly, from phishing or scams.

Antivirus for Windows®

Antivirus software for Windows computers

Norton was one of the first antivirus solutions for Windows computers, and we’ve been innovating for decades to develop new ways to help protect PCs. Today, the antivirus protection in Norton solutions uses advanced machine learning and emulation to determine whether files are good or bad, but Norton device security also has more ways to help protect your computer beyond antivirus.

Protection for PCs starts at the network-level, with Intrusion Prevention working together with the [Smart Firewall](https://uk.norton.com/feature/firewall) to analyze network traffic and help block potential online threats before they get on your computer.

The technology that powers Norton protection for PC uses Reputation Protection (Insight) to analyze reputation data, a tool that uses the reputation information gathered from our global network to classify software application files. It includes Behavioral Protection to monitor and help block applications that exhibit suspicious behavior, also based on the learnings from our huge trove of data, and tools to help protect against “zero-day” attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in applications or the operating system.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is Antivirus?

What role does antivirus software play in helping protect your devices?

Originally, antivirus scanned computer files and looked for patterns known to match computer viruses. Today, the best antivirus engines use multiple methods for identifying known and unknown online threats, and antivirus is still a foundational component of security software.

Antivirus is file-based protection, and after a virus attack, having virus-infected files on a target computer or mobile device is one of the main ways online threats remain on that device after the initial attack. Because of this, file-based protection will always be instrumental in helping detect, neutralize and remove viruses.

### What is the difference between antivirus and internet security?

Antivirus is an important part of what you might call internet security, security software or device security. A security solution includes antivirus as one of the foundations of how it helps defend against malware, but “internet security” typically refers to a software suite that has additional types of technology in addition to antivirus.

### Why is it important to have an antivirus program?

A computer, tablet or smartphone that connects to the Internet has the potential to encounter viruses and malware. While you may be careful what you do online, you could still visit a website that has been compromised with malware (without even knowing it) or download malware from a message from a trusted friend whose account was hacked. Someone else who uses your device might not be as careful as you. Having antivirus and security software for your computer or mobile device gives you protection against many types of malware that might not be easy to spot.

### How do you check for a virus on a computer?

Antivirus and security software will include a scanning function to check for viruses and malware.

### How do you get rid of a virus on your computer?

Antivirus and security software will include tools for virus and malware removal. Norton LifeLock also offers a free tool for PCs called [Norton Power Eraser](https://support.norton.com/sp/static/external/tools/npe.html) for do-it-yourself virus removal. Norton subscribers can also contact Member Services & Support if you think you have a virus or malware.
