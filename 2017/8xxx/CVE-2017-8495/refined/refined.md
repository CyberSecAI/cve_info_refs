Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the Kerberos protocol's reliance on unauthenticated plaintext within KDC responses, specifically the Ticket field. Implementations of the protocol incorrectly used the unauthenticated plaintext Ticket data rather than the authenticated and encrypted metadata within the KDC response. This subtle error in handling the Ticket data led to the vulnerability. This was caused by a two-line bug in several independent Kerberos implementations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Plaintext:** Kerberos messages contain portions that are neither encrypted nor integrity-protected, making them susceptible to manipulation.
*   **Incorrect Metadata Usage:** Implementations mistakenly used the unauthenticated plaintext Ticket data instead of the authenticated metadata from the encrypted KDC response.
*   **SNAME Field Tampering:** The vulnerability allows tampering of the SNAME field during ticket exchange, a critical part of the Kerberos process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Mutual Authentication:** Attackers can bypass Kerberos' mutual authentication mechanism, effectively defeating its security guarantees.
*   **Service Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate services to a client through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
*   **Remote Credential Theft:** In some cases, this could lead to remote credential theft, enabling remote privilege escalation.
*   **Bypass of Extended Protection:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass Extended Protection for Authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Attackers must be on-path (logically or physically) between the client and the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **On-Path Position:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the KDC, allowing them to intercept and modify Kerberos messages.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to intercept the communication between the client and the KDC.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is client-side, meaning that patches must be applied to all affected client machines to mitigate the risk.
*   The vulnerability existed in some implementations for over 20 years without being discovered.
*   This vulnerability has been given the name "Orpheus' Lyre" due to its ability to put "Kerberos to sleep" similar to how the mythological Orpheus put Cerberus to sleep with his music.
*   Multiple vendors and operating systems were affected, including Microsoft, Heimdal, FreeBSD, Fedora, Samba, Debian, Synology, Apple (iOS and macOS), and Oracle Java.

This analysis provides more detail than the original CVE description by outlining the root cause, how it can be exploited, and what the impact is. The analysis also contains more technical information as to why this vulnerability exists due to the use of unauthenticated plaintext in Kerberos messages and how different vendors were impacted.
