The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Canvas v3.3.0 software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating blog posts, allowing the injection of malicious script code. Specifically, the 'title' and 'content' fields of new posts are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability
- Lack of input sanitization/validation
- Lack of output encoding

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution in users' browsers.
- Potential for stealing cookies or performing actions on behalf of other users (including administrators).
- User data compromise, session hijacking and further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious user creates a blog post with embedded JavaScript code in the title and/or content fields.
- When other users view the post in the "All posts" list, or in the post's preview, the injected script executes within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user of the application. An unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create new posts in the application.
