- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper design of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) in Huawei Honor 5S smart phones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device allows unauthorized access to the factory reset page by dialing a special code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can restore the phone to factory settings, bypassing the FRP lock.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the smartphone is required. The attacker then dials a special code to access the factory reset page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the device.
