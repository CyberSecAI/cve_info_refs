# Swift tempurl middleware reveals signatures in the logfiles (CVE-2017-8761)

Bug #1685798 reported by
[Christian Schwede](https://launchpad.net/~cschwede)
on 2017-04-24

[256](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

|  | [OpenStack Object Storage (swift)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift) | Fix Released | Undecided | [Christian Schwede](https://launchpad.net/~cschwede) |  |
|  | [OpenStack Security Advisory](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa) | Won't Fix | Undecided | Unassigned |  |
|  | [Swift3](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift3) | New | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

The proxy server will log valid temporary urls, that might be used to gain access to data by anyone with access to the logfiles. This is especially important with tempurls that are valid for extended

periods and/or when using central logging servers, accessed by operators that have no access to the Swift servers.

Example logentry:

Apr 24 13:25:16 localhost proxy-server[5849]: 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 24/Apr/2017/13/25/16 GET /v1/AUTH\_test/test/something%3Ftemp\_url\_sig%3D99e80d557807904d15c69f4ef85bce42cfcd0bd5%26temp\_url\_expires%3D1493041071 HTTP/1.0 401 - curl/7.51.0 - - 35 - tx01de01a8da5a4052988bc-0058fdfcbc - 0.0178 - - 1493040316.148339987 1493040316.166150093 -

I propose to trim the temp\_url\_sig, like we are already doing for tokens - see attached patch.

Having had to debug customer reports that tempurl "does not work", I found it can be be useful to see exactly what they sent, vs what they thought they sent. So as debug aid, I suggest you have a way of switching this off with something like:

[tempurl]

    log\_signatures\_for\_accounts: AUTH\_test,AUTH\_other

By only logging for specific accounts, you don't expose all users. You can advise the account owner to change their keys after the debug period is over.

[Even with logging, it can still be hard to debug because the proxy-logger URL-encodes before logging and this is often the area where signature-encoding is wrong to start with]

Fairly certain there are similar concerns for swift3 and pre-signed urls. See <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html> for what those look like.

I think Donagh's point is spot on

^ that works for me, we definitely need to follow up with that in the example file.

Donagh, I think exempting accounts from truncation would be a good feature for followup after we get out from under the embargo. I can also confirmed, as Christian's commit message points out, that only authorized signatures are truncated - which could help with debugging for ops:

The patch works. I have a couple of small nits: (1) the example conf and associated docs weren't updated and (2) no matter the prefix length given, the logged value will now always end with "..."

I'm fine with (2) being handled in a follow-up, but I think it's a bad idea to land a patch and wait for docs later.

The short-circuiting around OPTIONS requests [1] makes me nervous. If you've got a web app that uses tempurls, won't we still log the sig in the CORS pre-flight request? Similar concerns around the check for disallowed headers [2] -- and at that point, we \*know\* the sig is valid.

I like Donagh's idea to allow disabling this for specific accounts; will will submit a public proposal once this landed.

I stashed Tim's patch into mine, and also updated the sample and docstring and added one more test.

Please review the proposed impact description for a Swift advisory (assuming the solution in the attached patches will also work for supported stable/newton and stable/ocata branches), and let me know what needs to be clarified or corrected:

Title: Swift proxy-server logs tempurl signatures

Reporter: Christian Schwede (Red Hat)

Products: Swift

Affects: <=2.10.1, >=2.11.0 <=2.13.0

Description:

Christian Schwede with Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Swift. The proxy-server logs full tempurl paths, potentially leaking reusable tempurl signatures to anyone with read access to these logs. All Swift deployments using the tempurl middleware are affected.

Swift reviewers, does the proposed impact description in comment #12 basically cover the risk/exposure here? And are there plans to backport the fix to stable/newton and stable/ocata branches? If yes on all counts, I'll go ahead with requesting a CVE assignment from MITRE.

I think the description is accurate. Once we have the backports available, we'll land those as well.

I'd like to have Christian's take on the CVE description. Also, I'd like Tim's take on the related swift3 impact, so a reveal here doesn't also reveal a bug in that project.

If possible, I would like to mention the original reporter of this in the CVE:

"Bülent Topcu from Turkcell reported a vulnerability in Swift."

He reported this to me, is aware of the upcoming CVE and fine being mentioned in the CVE itself. He is not on Launchpad, therefore I can't add him directly as a subscriber to this CVE.

Description itself looks good to me. Backport for Newton has a small conflict, but nothing serious; Ocata backport should be doable in Gerrit itself.

Thanks John and Christian! So sounds like I can privately request a CVE assignment using the revised impact description below (with reporter details corrected and taking last week's 2.14.0 release on master into account), and we can hold off scheduling publication of the advisory and patches until we hear back from Tim:

Title: Swift proxy-server logs tempurl signatures

Reporter: Bülent Topcu (Turkcell)

Products: Swift

Affects: <=2.10.1, >=2.11.0 <=2.13.0, ==2.14.0

Description:

Bülent Topcu with Turkcell reported a vulnerability in Swift. The proxy-server logs full tempurl paths, potentially leaking reusable tempurl signatures to anyone with read access to these logs. All Swift deployments using the tempurl middleware are affected.

Yeah, that all looks sane. It may be worth noting that pre-signed URLs for Swift3 are similarly affected -- the mechanism is very similar to Swift tempurls. With the current plans to reintegrate Swift3 into Swift, it seems like patching Swift3 will be a pretty low priority.

Looks like this report fell through the cracks back in 2017 when the VMT was waiting for feedback. Is it still relevant now, and should we put it back in the pipeline to patch/announce?

It doesn't look like this report has seen any activity since my update two months ago, so consider this a friendly reminder:

The embargo for this report is due to expire one month from today, on May 27, and will be switched public on or shortly after that day if it is not already resolved sooner.

Thanks!

The embargo for this report has expired and is now lifted, so it's acceptable to discuss further in public.

commit f2c279bae94689e2062beb6d0030d168a0b4cbdf

Author: Matthew Oliver <email address hidden>

Date: Thu Feb 3 16:29:53 2022 +1100

Trim sensitive information in the logs (CVE-2017-8761)

Several headers and query params were previously revealed in logs but

    are now redacted:

\* X-Auth-Token header (previously redacted in the {auth\_token} field,

        but not the {headers} field)

      \* temp\_url\_sig query param (used by tempurl middleware)

      \* Authorization header and X-Amz-Signature and Signature query

        parameters (used by s3api middleware)

This patch adds some new middleware helper methods to track headers and

    query parameters that should be redacted by proxy-logging. While

    instantiating the middleware, authors can call either:

register\_sensitive\_header('case-insensitive-header-name')

       register\_sensitive\_param('case-sensitive-query-param-name')

to add items that should be redacted. The redaction uses proxy-logging's

    existing reveal\_sensitive\_prefix config option to determine how much to

    reveal.

Note that query params will still be logged in their entirety if

    eventlet\_debug is enabled.

UpgradeImpact

    =============

    The reveal\_sensitive\_prefix config option now applies to more items;

    operators should review their currently-configured value to ensure it

    is appropriate for these new contexts. In particular, operators should

    consider reducing the value if it is more than 20 or so, even if that

    previously offered sufficient protection for auth tokens.

I'm thrilled to see that a fix finally merged in master for this, thanks for driving it to a conclusion!

Given that the bug report is 5 years old, and has been public for nearly 2 years now, I suspect there's not a lot of point in issuing a security advisory for it. If there's interest though, and a plan to backport the fix to maintained stable branches, please reply and I'll switch our OSSA bugtask back to an active state.
