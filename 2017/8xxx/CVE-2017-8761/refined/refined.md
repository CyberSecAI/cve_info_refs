The provided content relates to CVE-2017-8761.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Swift proxy server logs full temporary URLs, including the signature, which can be used to gain access to data. This is especially critical when temporary URLs are valid for extended periods or when using centralized logging servers accessible to operators without access to Swift servers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Exposure of temporary URL signatures in proxy server logs.
- Logging of sensitive data (tempurl signatures).
- Inadequate redaction of sensitive data in logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to data via leaked temporary URL signatures.
- Potential data breach due to signature exposure.
- Reusable temporary URLs being obtained from log files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to proxy server log files.
- Exposure of log files to unauthorized individuals.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to access the proxy server's log files.
- No direct access to the Swift server is required, just access to the logs.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all Swift deployments using the tempurl middleware.
- The vulnerability is present in Swift versions <=2.10.1, >=2.11.0 <=2.13.0, and 2.14.0 up to 2.15.1.
- A patch was implemented to truncate the `temp_url_sig` in the logs.
- A configuration option `reveal_sensitive_prefix` was introduced to control how much of the signature is revealed in logs, with a default of 20 characters, although it is recommended to be lower.
- The fix was merged in OpenStack Swift version 2.29.0.
- The `X-Auth-Token` header, `Authorization` header, `X-Amz-Signature`, and `Signature` query parameters are also affected and redacted by the fix.
- The vulnerability was initially reported by BÃ¼lent Topcu from Turkcell.
