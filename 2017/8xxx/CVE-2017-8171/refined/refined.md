- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper implementation of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) in some Huawei smartphones. An attacker can bypass the Google account verification during phone reconfiguration after a factory reset by using the Talkback mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - FRP bypass vulnerability
    - Improper access control allowing bypass of Google account verification
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the Factory Reset Protection, allowing them to modify the phone's configuration.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Physical access to the phone is required.
    - Exploitation occurs during the phone's re-configuration after a factory reset when FRP is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker must have physical access to the affected Huawei smartphone.
    - Attacker needs to be able to trigger the factory reset protection (FRP) function.
    - Attacker needs to be able to log into Talkback mode.
    - Attacker needs to perform certain actions in Talkback mode to bypass the Google account verification.
