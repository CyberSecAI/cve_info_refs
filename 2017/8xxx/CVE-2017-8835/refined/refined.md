Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-8835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the Peplink Balance Routers. Specifically, the `bauth` cookie parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection when accessing the `/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The `bauth` cookie is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Critical Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access the SQLite session database, which contains sensitive information such as user credentials and session variables.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By crafting specific SQL queries, an attacker can select an existing administrator session, effectively bypassing authentication.
*   **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract usernames and potentially other sensitive information by manipulating the SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is over the network, specifically targeting the web interface of the Peplink device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to initiate the SQL injection. They can send a crafted request directly to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Peplink device.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit can be tested using `sqlmap` with a crafted `bauth` cookie parameter.
*   The vulnerable parameter is within the cookie and not a part of the URL.
*   The database backend is SQLite, which allows the attacker to use SQLite-specific commands and techniques.

**Exploit Example:**
   *   A sample vulnerable request to demonstrate session hijacking:

```
bauth=-12' or id IN (select s.id from sessions as s left join
sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where v.name='rwa' and v.value='1')
or '1'='2
```

   * A sample SQL query to retrieve usernames:
```
SELECT id FROM sessions WHERE sessionid = '-14' or id IN (select s.id
from sessions as s left join sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where
v.name='username' and substr(v.value,1,3)='adm')
```
