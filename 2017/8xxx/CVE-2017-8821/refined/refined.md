Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8821:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Tor handles RSA public keys in PEM format. Specifically, Tor uses OpenSSL to parse these keys.
*   A specially crafted public key, when parsed by OpenSSL, triggers a password prompt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is that a malformed RSA public key can force Tor to pause and wait for a passphrase input from the terminal.
*   **Unintended Password Prompt:** OpenSSL unexpectedly asks for a password when parsing a crafted *public* key, which should not require a password.
*   **Blocking Behavior:** This password prompt blocks Tor's operation, preventing it from functioning correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Interruption:** Attackers can cause a denial of service by injecting these malformed keys, making Tor unavailable.
*   **Potential Traffic Analysis:** The DoS caused by the crafted key on a busy onion service or client could aid in traffic analysis by causing the service to block.
*   **Blocking Tor Processes:** Tor instances, especially those running without a terminal, are affected because OpenSSL will attempt to read a passphrase from the terminal.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Directory Objects:** Injecting the crafted public key within a microdescriptor, an onion service descriptor, or a relay/bridge descriptor.
*   **Network Injection:** Attackers can insert the crafted keys in any location where Tor parses RSA keys in PEM format, such as in the directory information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Malformed Keys:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the crafted RSA public key into a location where Tor will process it. This could be via a compromised or malicious directory authority or by injecting into the network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz and is tracked as testcase 6360145429790720.
*   The fix involves ensuring that Tor does not attempt to parse public keys that would lead to the unintended passphrase prompt.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Tor, emphasizing the need for users to upgrade to patched versions.
*   Tor instances running as a daemon (without a terminal) or within another process might not be vulnerable, but this depends on OpenSSL's behavior in such cases.
