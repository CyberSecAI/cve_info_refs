Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `getpage` HTTP parameter within the `cgi-bin/webproc` script of the Wireless Repeater BE126. The script fails to sanitize or escape this parameter before using it in an include file operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI.  Because the `getpage` parameter isn't properly sanitized, an attacker can inject file paths, including those outside the intended web directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`, potentially revealing user account information (usernames and password hashes).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint. The `getpage` parameter within the URL is manipulated to include a file path on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Wireless Repeater BE126 device.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests to construct the malicious URL with the LFI payload.
