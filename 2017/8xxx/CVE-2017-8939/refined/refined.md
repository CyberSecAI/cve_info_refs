This document does not contain information about CVE-2017-8939. It discusses a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS applications related to improper TLS certificate validation, which is not related to the specified CVE.

The document primarily focuses on the following:
- **Vulnerability:** Improper TLS certificate validation in iOS applications, leading to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
- **Root Cause:** Applications failing to properly validate TLS certificates or disabling validation altogether.
- **Weakness:** Lack of proper TLS certificate validation allows attackers to intercept and potentially modify traffic by presenting self-signed or invalid certificates.
- **Impact:** Attackers can intercept sensitive data, such as login credentials, authentication tokens, and other user information. This could lead to account compromise, data breaches, and manipulation of user data.
- **Attack Vector:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be carried out by attackers in the following positions:
    - Physically proximate to the victim on the same Wi-Fi network.
    - With privileged access to the network the victim is connected to.
    - Control of a device on the same Wi-Fi network.
    - VPN providers, or attackers who have compromised VPN gateways.
    - Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
- **Attacker Capabilities:**
    - Ability to intercept network traffic.
    - Ability to generate invalid TLS certificates for the targeted servers.
    - Basic understanding of network traffic and TLS.
- **Specific Applications Listed:** The document then provides a list of 27 applications with their affected versions, and what information was confirmed to be vulnerable to interception. It notes if the vulnerability has been fixed or not. Some of the noted applications have CVE IDs associated with them (e.g., "HipChat" (CVE-2017-8058), "Foxit PDF" (CVE-2017-8059)).

The vulnerability detailed allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack due to the app failing to validate the presented TLS certificate. This allows an attacker to generate invalid TLS certificates and intercept the traffic from the app.

The document describes the general TLS vulnerability and details specific apps affected by this vulnerability class. It does not reference CVE-2017-8939.

Therefore, the response is: UNRELATED
