  "cve": "CVE-2017-8838",
  "description": "The Peplink devices are vulnerable to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue via the syncid parameter. By calling the URL with a malicious syncid value, it is possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can be abused to steal session cookies.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `syncid` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript in the syncid parameter and tricking a user into visiting the URL, it is possible to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. The victim needs to be logged into the web interface and visit the crafted link."
