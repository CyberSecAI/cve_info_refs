{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap buffer overflow when parsing a specially crafted CAR archive file. When SAPCAR program opens a file containing an archived file block different than the known ones, it reads an additional 32 bytes of file metadata. The program then uses the last two bytes of the data read as a size field, and copies that amount of data into a fixed-length buffer previously allocated in the heap. The size field is not properly validated.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based Buffer Overflow [CWE-122]. The program does not validate the size field before copying data into a heap-allocated buffer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local code execution. A successful exploit could lead to local code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted CAR archive file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious CAR archive file to the vulnerable SAPCAR program. This requires local access to the system where SAPCAR is run."
