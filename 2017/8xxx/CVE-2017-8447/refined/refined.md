- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An error in X-Pack Security privilege enforcement allowed users with either 'delete' or 'index' permissions on an index to issue both delete and index requests against that index, which was not intended.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect privilege enforcement in X-Pack Security.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users could perform actions (delete/index) on indices that they were not explicitly granted permissions for. A user with 'index' permission could also 'delete' and vice-versa. Users with 'bulk' permissions could delete documents without having explicit 'delete' permissions.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted request to delete or index against an index.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with either 'delete' or 'index' permissions on a given index in an affected Elasticsearch cluster.
