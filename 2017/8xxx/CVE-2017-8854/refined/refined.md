    {
      "cve": "CVE-2017-8854",
      "details": "The release notes for wolfSSL version 3.10.2 mention a medium-level security fix related to the processing of OCSP responses. Specifically, if OCSP is used without hard faults enforced and no alternative revocation checks like OCSP stapling, updating is recommended.",
      "affected_component": "OCSP Response Processing",
       "root_cause": "Inadequate handling of OCSP responses when hard fault enforcement is not enabled and OCSP stapling is not used.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of OCSP responses",
        "Lack of hard fault enforcement for OCSP",
        "Absence of alternative revocation checks (OCSP stapling)"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact is not explicitly defined beyond being a 'medium level' fix. However, based on the nature of OCSP being a revocation check, failure to properly handle responses could lead to accepting revoked certificates as valid, potentially allowing for attacks such as man-in-the-middle or impersonation.",
       "attack_vectors": [
           "Man-in-the-middle attacks",
           "Impersonation attacks"
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to perform actions that require the use of OCSP and to intercept or manipulate OCSP responses. The attacker must also be in a position where hard faults are not enabled and OCSP stapling is not being utilized."
