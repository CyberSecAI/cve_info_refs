- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition in the audio driver when a malicious application accesses a shared resource leads to a null pointer dereference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition leading to null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: System reboot (denial of service).
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application must be installed by the user on the smartphone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application.
