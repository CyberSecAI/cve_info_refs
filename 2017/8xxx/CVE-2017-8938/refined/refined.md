The provided document does not contain information about CVE-2017-8938. However, it details a class of vulnerability affecting multiple iOS applications, where they fail to properly validate TLS certificates, enabling man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. The document further provides CVE IDs for a subset of those applications.

**Vulnerability Class:** Improper TLS certificate validation

**Root Cause:** Applications failing to properly validate TLS certificates, or disabling certificate validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure handling of TLS certificates
- Lack of proper validation of TLS certificates
- Disabling certificate validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Interception of sensitive data, including login credentials (usernames, passwords), authentication tokens, and other potentially sensitive data transmitted by the application.
- Manipulation of data sent back to the device.
- Potential for account compromise and unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, such as:
    - Being within Wi-Fi range
    - Controlling a device connected to the same Wi-Fi network
    - Controlling a VPN server or gateway
    - Being an ISP
