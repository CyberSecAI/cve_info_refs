{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `JavascriptFunction::EntryCall` method in Chakra, the JavaScript engine used by Microsoft Edge, incorrectly decrements the `args.Info.Count` value, which represents the number of arguments passed to a function. This decrement does not properly consider the `CallFlags_ExtraArg` flag. When this flag is set, a subsequent routine (`ArgumentReader::AdjustArguments`) will decrement the argument count again because the last argument is not meant to be used as an actual argument. This leads to a double decrement, resulting in `args.Info.Count` becoming 0.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect argument handling",
    "Logic error in decrementing argument count",
    "Improper handling of `CallFlags_ExtraArg`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `Function.prototype.call` method with a proxy, which sets the `CallFlags_ExtraArg` flag and triggers the incorrect argument count decrement in `JavascriptFunction::EntryCall`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to execute JavaScript code within Microsoft Edge that leverages a proxy object when calling Function.prototype.call."
