Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-8035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A vulnerability in the Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller API (CAPI) allowed a carefully crafted request to expose files on the Cloud Controller VM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Cloud Controller API handles specific requests, allowing access beyond intended boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a Space Developer to gain unauthorized access to files residing on the Cloud Controller VM. This could expose sensitive information and potentially allow further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted CAPI request originating from a user with the "Space Developer" role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the role of a "Space Developer" within the Cloud Foundry environment.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft or manipulate CAPI requests.

**Affected Versions:**
*   CAPI-release versions after v1.6.0 and prior to v1.35.0
*   cf-release versions after v244 and prior to v268

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Cloud Foundry v268 or later.
*   For standalone component users, upgrade to CAPI-release 1.35.0 or later.
