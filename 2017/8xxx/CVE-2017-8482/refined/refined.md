{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The generic exception dispatching code in the Windows kernel discloses portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients via the CONTEXT structure set up for the ring-3 exception handlers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized kernel stack memory is being exposed in the CONTEXT structure passed to user-mode exception handlers.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local authenticated attackers could potentially defeat certain exploit mitigations (kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by raising an exception, which causes the kernel to prepare a CONTEXT structure and pass it to a user-mode exception filter.  The attacker would need to trigger an exception to exploit this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local authenticated access is required to trigger the exception and exploit the vulnerability."
