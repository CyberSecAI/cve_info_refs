The provided content is related to CVE-2017-8893.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
AeroAdmin 4.1 uses a function to copy data between two pointers where the size of the data copied is taken directly from a network packet without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)
- The size of the data to be copied is directly taken from a network packet and is not validated before being used in a `rep movsb` instruction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows for a buffer overflow which could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted network packet to AeroAdmin server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the machine running AeroAdmin server.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in AeroAdmin's binary, where the size of data to be copied is controlled by the attacker via network packet.
- The `rep movsb` instruction uses the attacker controlled size value to copy data which leads to the overflow.
- The proof of concept code provided shows a python script that sends a crafted packet to the target IP address and port to trigger the vulnerability.
- The register state at the time of the crash is also provided to aid in analysis.
