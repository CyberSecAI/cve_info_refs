{
  "CVE-2017-8225": {
    "Root cause": "The custom HTTP server, based on GoAhead, has an authentication bypass vulnerability when accessing `.ini` configuration files. The server incorrectly handles requests with empty 'loginuse' and 'loginpas' parameters in the URI, allowing unauthenticated access.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive configuration data from the camera, including credentials, FTP accounts, and SMTP accounts.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the camera's web interface, including an empty 'loginuse' and 'loginpas' parameter in the URI, targeting an '.ini' file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device and knowledge of the target IP address or hostname. No prior authentication is needed."
