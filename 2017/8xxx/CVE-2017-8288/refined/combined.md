Sometimes when I lock the screen, the dock and window list will be in view.

I am running Gnome 3.14 on EL7.2 Beta with EasyScreenCast 0.97.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c0)  Emilio Pozuelo Monfort    2017-04-25 15:50:40 UTC  ``` Hi,  It is possible to get extensions enabled in the screenshield if one extension failed to reload. To trigger this bug, you need to:  - have one extension that fails to reload - have other extensions enabled. order of the enabled-extensions key matters - change disable-extension-version-validation to trigger a call to _onVersionValidationChanged()  _onVersionValidationChanged() doesn't handle exceptions to enableExtension(), which can happen with some extensions that fail to reload. One example is the EasyScreenCast extension before I fixed it, see:  <https://github.com/EasyScreenCast/EasyScreenCast/issues/46> <https://github.com/EasyScreenCast/EasyScreenCast/pull/131>  If you have that extension installed (a broken version of it, that is), and trigger a _onVersionValidationChanged() you'll get:  Apr 25 17:12:12 tatooine gnome-shell[5006]: JS ERROR: Error: Type name

lock screen is fine, i.e. there are no extensions enabled. However if you lock it again, you'll finally get the other extensions enabled on the screenshield. If one of those extensions is e.g. the applications menu, you can start any program from there.  I have come up with a patch that solves this, though I'm not entirely sure of how getting the exception in _onVersionValidationChanged() leads to all this. Perhaps someone more familiar with all this can double check this. I'm not sure if we should catch exceptions in other places, e.g. in disableAllExtensions(). Perhaps we should to be on the safe side, though this patch is sufficient to fix this bug here... Patch coming in a moment.  BTW all this is with gnome-shell 3.22.3. I haven't tried with a newer version, though the extensionSystem.js hasn't changed much, so this likely affects newer versions. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c1)  Emilio Pozuelo Monfort    2017-04-25 15:51:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 350411](attachment.cgi?id=350411 "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=350411&action=edit "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions") [[review]](review?bug=781728&attachment=350411) extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c2)  Emilio Pozuelo Monfort    2017-04-25 15:52:48 UTC  ``` FWIW this was initially seen in Kali (<https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=2513>) but I can reproduce it on Debian sid as well. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c3)  Florian MÃ¼llner    2017-04-25 16:29:58 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 350411](attachment.cgi?id=350411 "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=350411&action=edit "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions") [[review]](review?bug=781728&attachment=350411):  LGTM ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c4)  Emilio Pozuelo Monfort    2017-04-25 17:44:36 UTC  ``` Thanks, pushed.

Dunno. If we keep catching errors here, then we should also guard against the same error elsewhere (for instance when triggered from `gnome-shell-extension-prefs --reload`). And as errors in reloadExtension() essentially boil down to an error in disableExtension() or enableExtension(), we'd have to guard all those calls as well. I'm not overly keen on spreading try/catch blocks all over the place, but it's certainly a valid position. However keeping just this particular error handling because someone happened to stamp a CVE on it really seems silly ... ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c13)  Carlos Garnacho    2017-07-13 13:43:01 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 352174](attachment.cgi?id=352174 "extensions: Consistently handle createExtenionObject() errors") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=352174&action=edit "extensions: Consistently handle createExtenionObject() errors") [[review]](review?bug=781728&attachment=352174) extensions: Consistently handle createExtenionObject() errors  Looks good! btw, typo in log summary, "Extenion" :) ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c14)  Carlos Garnacho    2017-07-13 13:43:12 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 352175](attachment.cgi?id=352175 "extensionSystem: Catch import errors") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=352175&action=edit "extensionSystem: Catch import errors") [[review]](review?bug=781728&attachment=352175) extensionSystem: Catch import errors  Makes total sense. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c15)  Carlos Garnacho    2017-07-13 13:45:08 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 352176](attachment.cgi?id=352176 "extensionSystem: Consistently handle initExtension() errors") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=352176&action=edit "extensionSystem: Consistently handle initExtension() errors") [[review]](review?bug=781728&attachment=352176) extensionSystem: Consistently handle initExtension() errors  The code change and the rationale in the commit log make sense, but the "throw new error" right above in the patch context kinda defeats my sense of "consistent" :/ ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c16)  Florian MÃ¼llner    2017-07-13 14:33:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to Carlos Garnacho from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c13)) > Looks good! btw, typo in log summary, "Extenion" :)  Gah, fixed locally.

The reasoning for not touching that code is that it's not an error that can be triggered by an extension, but only by a bug in the extension system itself.

I just thought it's actually not that bad as a safety net (because decisions and code direction get hazy over the years), but it's indeed a too specific place for it to be.

Right, makes some sense to keep that as an error then... maybe the log summary just needs a s/errors/extension errors/ to lower my brow :) ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c18)  Florian MÃ¼llner    2017-07-17 11:04:59 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 350411](attachment.cgi?id=350411 "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=350411&action=edit "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions") [[review]](review?bug=781728&attachment=350411) extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions  [Attachment 350411](attachment.cgi?id=350411 "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=350411&action=edit "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions") pushed as [ff425d1](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/commit/?id=ff425d1) - extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c19)  Florian MÃ¼llner    2017-07-17 11:05:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 355745](attachment.cgi?id=355745 "extensionSystem: Handle all initExtension() extension errors") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=355745&action=edit "extensionSystem: Handle all initExtension() extension errors") [[review]](review?bug=781728&attachment=355745) extensionSystem: Handle all initExtension() extension errors  Updated the commit message to not imply that non-extension errors were handled as well. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=781728#c20)  Florian MÃ¼llner    2017-07-17 11:06:49 UTC  ``` [Attachment 352173](attachment.cgi?id=352173 "Revert \"extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions\"") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=352173&action=edit "Revert \"extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions\"") pushed as [8d6efde](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/commit/?id=8d6efde) - Revert "extensionSystem: handle reloading broken extensions" [Attachment 352175](attachment.cgi?id=352175 "extensionSystem: Catch import errors") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=352175&action=edit "extensionSystem: Catch import errors") pushed as [d461d02](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/commit/?id=d461d02) - extensionSystem: Catch import errors [Attachment 355745](attachment.cgi?id=355745 "extensionSystem: Handle all initExtension() extension errors") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=355745&action=edit "extensionSystem: Handle all initExtension() extension errors") pushed as [e845f41](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/commit/?id=e845f41) - extensionSystem: Handle all initExtension() extension errors ``` |  |

| Summary | 0002513: Lockscreen doesn't always hide the menus and the dock | | | | |
| Description | Cf <https://twitter.com/nanotechz9l/status/631270327515897856>  This is probably a bug in one of the GNOME Shell extension we use and/or modify. It would be nice to identify the problematic shell extension (if any) by disabling them all and enabling only one at a time... or by disabling only one at a time and seeing when the problem occurs or not. | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | It's not clear how to reproduce this issue systematically. If someone can identify exactly how to trigger this it would be nice. | | | | |

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNiLo9RERBo&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNiLo9RERBo&feature=youtu.be)  thanks for looking into it. this seems dangerous to me.  please let me know if there's any more info i can provide! |

The dconf update call after changing /etc/dconf/db/local.d/kali-\* is somehow triggering an update of that key, for some reason.  After fixing the EasyScreenCast extension I have investigated the gnome-shell problem, since it shouldn't fail even if an extension fails to reload. That's now forwarded upstream at:  <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781728>  There's a patch that makes this bug not happen even with the broken EasyScreenCast extension - then the broken extension gets disabled but none of the others get enabled on the lock screen. That'd be good to avoid this problem in the future, but let's see what upstream says about this patch. |
