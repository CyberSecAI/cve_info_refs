Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8644:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `CInputDateTimeScrollerElement::_SelectValueInternal` function within Microsoft Edge's EdgeHTML engine. This occurs because the function uses an index, which in the proof-of-concept (PoC) has a value of 0xffffffff, to access an array without proper bounds checking. This index is obtained from an uninitialized data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- Improper initialization of data structures leading to an invalid index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a crash due to an access violation.
- An attacker, by controlling data at a specific memory location, could gain the ability to call `this->_UpdateSelected` with a controlled argument, potentially enabling them to achieve arbitrary code execution (write primitive).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by focusing on a `<input type="time">` element with `autofocus`.
- This can be achieved by loading a specially crafted HTML page in Microsoft Edge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious HTML page to a target user running a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge.
- No special permissions are needed on the target machine aside from the ability to run Edge.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific vulnerable version is Microsoft Edge 38.14393.1066.0 on Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit (OS version 1607, OS build 14393.1198).
- The PoC involves a simple HTML snippet with a CSS style and a time input element to trigger the vulnerability.
- The crash occurs within the `edgehtml!CInputDateTimeScrollerElement::_SelectValueInternal` function, specifically when accessing an array element using the invalid index.
