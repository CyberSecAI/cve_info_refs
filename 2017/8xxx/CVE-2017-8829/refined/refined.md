{
  "CVE-2017-8829": {
    "Description": "Deserialization vulnerability in lintian through 2.5.50.3 allows attackers to trigger code execution by requesting a review of a source package with a crafted YAML file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The YAML::XS module, used by lintian to parse YAML files, deserializes objects of any existing Perl class. This behavior can be abused to create objects that have a `DESTROY` method that is automatically executed when the object is destroyed or when the process exits.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure deserialization of YAML data",
      "Unrestricted object instantiation from YAML data"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution through the `DESTROY` method of instantiated objects. In the case of `lintian`, the `File::Temp::Dir` class could be abused to remove arbitrary directory trees.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Crafted YAML file within a source package",
        "Requesting a review of a source package with the crafted YAML file"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide a crafted YAML file as part of a source package that is reviewed by a vulnerable version of lintian"
  }
