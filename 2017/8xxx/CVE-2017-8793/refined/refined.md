  "vulnerability_id": "CVE-2017-8793",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The server-side request forgery vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization in the `wmProgressval.html` component.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially cause information disclosure and code execution by making the server perform requests to arbitrary URLs.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a POST request with a malicious URL to the `server` parameter of `/courier/web/1000@/wmProgressval.html`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Accellion FTA server."
  },
  "affected_product": "Accellion FTA before FTA_9_12_180",
  "additional_notes": "The regular expression used to validate URLs is missing a `^` character at the start, which allows an attacker to bypass the validation by including `https:` later in the URL."
