Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of unused `path_search` and `url_search` processors within the MODX CMS setup. These processors, when improperly handled, could potentially expose sensitive system directory information due to directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability through the `path_search` and `url_search` processors.
- Information leakage of system directories.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially access sensitive system files and directories that are not intended to be publicly available.
- This information could be used for further attacks or to gain deeper access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability was triggered via the search functionality which used the vulnerable processors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to use the search feature of the MODX CMS.
- No authentication was mentioned, implying the vulnerability may be exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable processors were removed in a commit (3b09e10) and backported into different branches.
- The issue was found in version 2.5.7 and fixed in 2.5.8.
- The pull request #13433 addresses the vulnerability by removing the vulnerable processors.
- Issue #13432 describes the discovery of the directory traversal vulnerability.
