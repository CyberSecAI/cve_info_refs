**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Compromise of the affected system: An attacker could potentially gain control over the affected system by uploading and executing malicious code.
- Privilege escalation: The attacker can execute code with the privileges of the user that the application is running under.
- Potential data breaches: With control over the system, attackers could gain access to sensitive data stored on or accessible through the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.
- Exploitation requires an application administrator account to upload the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the vulnerable application to upload files.
