{
  "CVE-2017-8640": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability exists due to a logic error in the `ParseVariableDeclaration` function within the Chakra JavaScript engine. Specifically, the `m_currentNodeFunc` is used regardless of the `buildAST` flag, which leads to incorrect modification of a function's flag (`grfpn`). This modification can cause the function's arguments to be uninitialized.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `ParseVariableDeclaration` function in the Chakra JavaScript engine incorrectly uses `m_currentNodeFunc` when the `buildAST` flag is false. This results in the function's `grfpn` flag being modified incorrectly.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Uninitialized arguments"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the use of uninitialized arguments.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious JavaScript code execution through Microsoft Edge browser"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to execute malicious javascript code within the context of Microsoft Edge browser. The provided PoC demonstrates a minimal example to trigger the vulnerability."
