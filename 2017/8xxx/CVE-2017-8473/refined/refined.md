{
  "CVE-2017-8473": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is due to the win32k!NtGdiGetRealizationInfo system call copying 24 bytes of data from the kernel stack to user mode, even when the declared size of the data structure is only 16 bytes. This results in an 8 byte information disclosure.",
    "Root cause": "The win32k!NtGdiGetRealizationInfo system call copies a fixed 24 bytes from the kernel stack to user mode, regardless of the size of the input structure. The internal win32k!GreGetRealizationInfo function initializes a local copy of the structure on the kernel stack with an adequate number of bytes, but the syscall handler later copies 24 bytes back to user mode, potentially disclosing uninitialized kernel stack memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Uninitialized Memory Read"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated local attacker can potentially read portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory, potentially defeating exploit mitigations such as kernel ASLR or accessing other secrets stored in the kernel address space. Repeatedly triggering the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain more sensitive information.",
     "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can trigger the vulnerability by making a call to win32k!NtGdiGetRealizationInfo system call with a specific structure. Specifically, the first dword of the provided structure should specify a size of 16 bytes, while the syscall handler copies 24 bytes regardless of the declared size.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local, authenticated user capable of calling the NtGdiGetRealizationInfo system call."
