Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `ReadMTVImage` function within the `mtv.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unfreed memory allocation: The `ReadMTVImage` function allocates memory but fails to free it, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Repeatedly processing crafted MTV files can lead to excessive memory consumption, eventually causing the application to crash due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted MTV file: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted MTV image file to ImageMagick for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply an MTV image to ImageMagick for processing. This could involve:
  - Submitting a crafted image through a web application.
  - Placing a crafted image in a directory processed by a script.
  - Sending the crafted image as part of a process that is using imagemagick.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified using AddressSanitizer (asan) which shows the exact location of the memory leak in `ReadMTVImage` at line 167 of `mtv.c`.
- A testcase file (`memory-leak-in-ReadMTVImage-11.mtv`) is provided as a proof of concept for triggering the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the ADLab of Venustech.
