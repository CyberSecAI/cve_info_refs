Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of undocumented accounts within EMC ViPR SRM, EMC Storage M&R, EMC VNX M&R, and EMC M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs. These accounts have default passwords for Webservice Gateway and RMI JMX components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Undocumented Accounts:** The systems contain accounts that are not intended for regular use or well-documented.
*   **Default Passwords:** These undocumented accounts use default passwords, making them easily guessable.
*   **Webservice and RMI JMX Exposure:** The vulnerable accounts provide access to Web service and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) JMX components.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker who knows the default passwords could potentially use these accounts to execute arbitrary web service and remote procedure calls on the affected system. This means they can potentially control and compromise the system.
*   **Full System Compromise**: The ability to execute arbitrary commands could lead to a complete compromise of the affected systems with significant potential impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Knowledge of Default Passwords:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the default passwords for the undocumented accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
*   **Password Knowledge:** The attacker needs prior knowledge of the default passwords associated with the undocumented accounts. This information is likely publicly known.
