{
    "CVE-2017-8932": {
        "Description": "A carry propagation flaw was found in the implementation of the P-256 elliptic curve in golang. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to extract private keys when static ECDH was used.",
        "Root cause": "A carry propagation bug exists in the P-256 elliptic curve implementation for x86-64 architectures in golang.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Improper handling of carry bits during scalar multiplication on the P-256 curve.",
            "Vulnerable elliptic curve implementation."
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker could potentially extract private keys when static ECDH was used, leading to compromise of confidentiality.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "By exploiting the flawed scalar multiplication implementation, an attacker could potentially extract the private keys using an adaptive attack by submitting crafted points and observing the failures",
	    "Static ECDH usage"
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with a system using the flawed elliptic curve implementation, particularly in scenarios where static ECDH is used.  The attacker must be able to craft specific input points to expose the vulnerability"
    }
