What type of report is this:

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| Bug report? | Y |
| Feature request? |  |
| Enhancement? |  |

## Description:

Mautic suffers from autnehticated CSRF in which an attacker can trick a user/admin to delete campaigns or contacts. These two operations are not protected with an anti-CSRF token. Other operations, e.g., adding contacts/campaigns are protected.

## If a bug:

| Q | A |
| --- | --- |
| Mautic version | 1.4.1 (as taken from Bitnami appliances) |
| PHP version |  |

### Steps to reproduce:

1. Get valid user session cookies and an ID of a campaign (or a contact)
2. Do a POST request (including the above cookies) to
   * s/campaigns/delete/`{ID}`
   * s/contacts/delete/`{ID}`?mauticUserLastActive=1

Replace `{ID}` with the ID of step 1.

### Log errors:

N.A.
