### Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities
