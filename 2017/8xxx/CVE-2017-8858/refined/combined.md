### Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities in Veritas NetBackup and Veritas NetBackup Appliance.

| Issue | Description | Severity | Fixed Version NetBackup | Fixed Version Appliance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Unauthenticated, arbitrary remote command execution through 'bprd'](#Issue1) | Critical | 7 May EEB for 7.7.2, Hotfix for 7.7.3 and 8.0 | 7 May EEB for 2.7.2, Hotfix for 2.7.3 and 3.0 |
| 2 | [Unauthenticated file copy and arbitrary remote command execution using 'bprd'](#Issue2) | Critical | 7 May EEB for 7.7.2, Hotfix for 7.7.3 and 8.0 | 7 May EEB for 2.7.2, Hotfix for 2.7.3 and 3.0 |
| 3 | [Unauthenticated privileged remote file write using 'bprd'](#Issue3) | Critical | 7 May EEB for 7.7.2, Hotfix for 7.7.3 and 8.0 | 7 May EEB for 2.7.2, Hotfix for 2.7.3 and 3.0 |

### Issues

#### Issue #1

Unauthenticated, arbitrary remote command execution using 'bprd'

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-8856](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8856)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.8 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

The 'bprd' process on a master server allows unauthenticated, arbitrary remote command execution. This bypasses directory whitelisting, permitting any command on the system to be executed as root/administrator.

This vulnerability only affects NetBackup Master Servers, it does not affect Media Servers or Clients.

Affected Products

* NetBackup 8.0 and earlier
* NetBackup Appliance 3.0 and earlier

#### Issue #2

Unauthenticated file copy and arbitrary remote command execution using 'bprd'

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-8857](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8857)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 10.0 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

The 'bprd' process on a master server allows an unauthenticated user to copy any file to any other file on any NetBackup host in the master server domain. This file can then be executed as root/administrator.

This vulnerability is only in NetBackup Master Servers, it is not in Media Servers or Clients. However, an attacker can use this vulnerability to affect Media Servers and Clients.

Affected Products

* NetBackup 8.0 and earlier
* NetBackup Appliance 3.0 and earlier

#### Issue 3

Unauthenticated privileged remote file write using 'bprd'

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-8858](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8858)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 10.0 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

The 'bprd' process on a master server allows an unauthenticated user to write to any file on any NetBackup host in the master server domain.  By default, this includes the file that contains the list of whitelisted directories thereby allowing an attacker to write to any file on the target system.  When combined with Issue #2 above this allows an attacker to write a new executable to the target system and then execute it.

This vulnerability only affects NetBackup Master Servers, it does not affect Media Servers or Clients.

Affected Products

* NetBackup 8.0 and earlier
* NetBackup Appliance 3.0 and earlier

### Questions

### Acknowledgement

Veritas would like to thank Sven Blumenstein and Xiaoran Wang from the Google Security Team for reporting these vulnerabilities.

### Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities
