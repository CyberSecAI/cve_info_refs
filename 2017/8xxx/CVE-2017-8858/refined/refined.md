The provided content is related to CVE-2017-8858.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'bprd' process on a master server allows an unauthenticated user to write to any file on any NetBackup host in the master server domain.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated privileged remote file write. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access controls within the 'bprd' process, allowing unauthorized users to write to arbitrary files on target systems.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can write to any file on the NetBackup host, including files containing whitelisted directories. This allows them to bypass the whitelist and potentially overwrite executable files or configurations. In conjunction with another vulnerability (CVE-2017-8857), an attacker can write and execute malicious code with root/administrator privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise and data breaches.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks leveraging the 'bprd' process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the NetBackup master server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
