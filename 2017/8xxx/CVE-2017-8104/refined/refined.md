The provided content relates to CVE-2017-8104.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in the smilie module of MyBB. It occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input used to construct file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application uses a user-provided input (`pathfolder`) without proper sanitization to construct a directory path which is then used in an `opendir()` function call. An attacker can use ".." sequences in this input to access files or directories outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially access sensitive files and directories outside the webroot.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `admin/index.php?module=config-smilies&action=add_multiple` path in the MyBB admin interface.
- The attack vector is through the `pathfolder` parameter in the POST request.
- By crafting a malicious `pathfolder` input containing directory traversal sequences like `../../bypass/smile`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the MyBB admin interface (likely requiring administrator privileges).
