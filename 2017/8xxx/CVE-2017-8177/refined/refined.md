Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of APK signature verification in some Huawei applications. This means that the apps do not check if the APK file is signed by a trusted source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Signature Verification:** The primary weakness is the absence of signature verification when installing or updating APK files for affected apps.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **App Hijacking:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to hijack the application. This means they could replace the legitimate app with a modified version.
*   **Potentially Malicious Code Execution:** The modified app could contain malicious code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network used to transmit the APK file. This could be a local network or a man-in-the-middle attack over a wide area network.
*   **APK Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or replace the legitimate APK file and modify it to include malicious content and resign it using a new certificate.
*   **Bypassing APK signature verification:** The vulnerability is that the affected apps lack the code that verifies the signatures of the APK, allowing the modified APK to be installed by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic where the app is downloaded or updated.
*   **APK Modification Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to modify and re-sign an APK file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document mentions that Huawei has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The advisory specifically names "HiWallet" app as being affected in versions earlier than 5.0.3.100
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSSv3 base score of 5.9 (Medium severity).
*  The report of this vulnerability came from a security researcher named Zhang Qing.
