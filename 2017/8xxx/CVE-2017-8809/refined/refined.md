Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-8809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a "Reflected File Download" issue found within the `api.php` component of MediaWiki.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected File Download (RFD):**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL that, when processed by `api.php`, causes the user's browser to download a file. This file could potentially be an executable or other harmful content. The "reflected" aspect means the malicious input is sent to the server and then reflected back in the response that triggers the download.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary file downloads onto the victim's machine.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** If the downloaded file is an executable or otherwise exploitable, this could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is a carefully crafted URL targeting the vulnerable `api.php` script. The attacker would need to get a victim to click on or otherwise access this crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **URL Crafting Ability:** The attacker needs the ability to construct a malicious URL with the proper parameters.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to access the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Abdullah Hussam.
*   The fix was released in MediaWiki versions 1.29.2, 1.28.3, and 1.27.4
*   Debian also released a security advisory (DSA 4036-1) to address the vulnerability in their `mediawiki` package.

In summary, CVE-2017-8809 describes a Reflected File Download vulnerability in MediaWiki's `api.php`, that can lead to arbitrary file download on a user's system. An attacker crafts a malicious URL and tricks the user into accessing it.
