{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ASUS router's web interface has multiple JSONP endpoints that reveal sensitive information, including network configurations, connected devices, and external IP addresses. These endpoints are vulnerable because they don't properly check user authentication, allowing attackers to access the information via Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "JSONP endpoints lack proper authentication.",
      "Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use these vulnerabilities to exfiltrate sensitive information from the router. This includes network configurations, connected devices, and the external IP address. This information could be used to further compromise the network or perform other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious website can load the JSONP endpoints via SCRIPT tags. As long as the matching function name is defined on that site, the sensitive information can be accessed.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the local IP address of the router and be able to trick a user on the same network to visit the malicious website."
