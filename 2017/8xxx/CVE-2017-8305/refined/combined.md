# CVE-2017-8305

| **Name** | CVE-2017-8305 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The UDFclient (before 0.8.8) custom strlcpy implementation has a buffer overflow. UDFclient's strlcpy is used only on systems with a C library (e.g., glibc) that lacks its own strlcpy. |

```
```
Package: udfclient
Version: 0.8.7-1

UDFClient has its own implementation of strlcpy function as standard
glibc in libc.so does not provide one. But this implementation in
UDFClient prior to version 0.8.8 has buffer overflow defect and writes
more characters as buffer size.

Mitre assigned [CVE-2017-8305](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8305) for this issue.

## UDFclient

UDFclient is a userland implementation of the UDF filingsystem as defined
by the [OSTA](http://www.osta.org) group. UDFclient was created as
a study platform for the full read and write kernel level implementation found
in the [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org) kernel. The NetBSD kernel
can now read and write all media and upto UDF 2.50 though it can't resize
metadata partitions yet.

UDFclient basicly provides a userinterface not unlike ftp(1) but differs in
that it allways fetches or writes files recursively from the disc(s). As from
version 0.4.9 it supports the basic *get, mget, put, mput, mv, rm, mkdir,
cd, lcd, free, pwd, lls* command set. *get* and *put* can now
also retrieve or store using different names than the origional.

---

## Supported systems

* [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org). UDFclient was developed on
  NetBSD and is running fine under both little endian and big endian machines.
  Actively tested on NetBSD/alpha, NetBSD/acorn32 (arm), NetBSD/sparc,
  NetBSD/pmax (mips). Tested are ATAPI CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD+RW and on SCSI CD-ROM
  and CD-RW (might give problems; not tested recently).
* [Linux](http://www.linux.org). It runs fine under GNU/Linux and
  RedHat Linux. Like NetBSD it ought to work fine under both ATAPI and SCSI
  CD-ROM's when using the /dev/sg\* devices. Note that under Linux 2.6.x ATAPI
  devices are read-only due to unresolved issues in the Linux ATAPI emulation
  blockdriver. *update* There seems to be a new resolved method for 2.6.x
  wich will be investigated and implemented soon i hope. Feedback on this would
  be much appreciated.
* [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org). New in version 0.3.2 on is
  support for ATAPI/SCSI trough FreeBSD's CAM interface. Thanks to Andriy Gapon
  for the patch!
* [DragonFly BSD](http://www.dragonflybsd.org). Although the [pkgsrc](http://www.pkgsrc.org) system already had a patch for it in
  it, this patch is finally taken into version 0.5.5.
* [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org). New in version 0.3.4 on is
  support for ATAPI/SCSI trough OpenBSD SCSI/ATAPI stack thats remarkable
  similar to NetBSD's though at small issues different. Thanks to Pedro
  Martelletto for the patch!

  newfs\_udf and mmc\_format. Thanks Pali for pointing them out!
* [UDFclient.0.8.7](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.8.7.tgz) :
  Minor release fixing newfs\_udf bug that would not detect an overflow on the
  number of sectors. It now allows for discs bigger than 2tb.
* [UDFclient.0.8.6](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.8.6.tgz) :
  Minor release fixing compilation on systems that have undetected or
  unsupported SCSI support.
* [UDFclient.0.8.5](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.8.5.tgz) :
  Minor release fixing some bugs that had crept in, enhancing cd\_disect a bit by
  printing out previously obmitted bits and finally and fixing compilation
  warnings given by gcc5 in Linux
* [UDFclient.0.8.1](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.8.1.tgz) :
  Fix spelling mistakes! Thanks Pali!
* [UDFclient.0.8](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.8.tgz) : Fix
  metadata distribution issue to be calculated on the disc size rather than on a
  fixed length. Also fix 32 bit issues. It can now create discs bigger than one
  TerraByte!
* [UDFclient.0.7.7](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.7.7.tgz) :
  Fix distribution error in 0.7.6 : some parts are not ready for release (yet).
  While here also fix a warning on a debug print format.
* UDFclient.0.7.6 : After some time being dormant, this new release fixes a
  small standing bug in *newfs\_udf* regarding the volume set identifier
  name.
* [UDFclient.0.7.5](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.7.5.tgz) :
  After some time being dormant, this new release fixes a lot of small standing
  bugs and a serious bugfix that prevented it to read Microsoft formatted UDF
  2.50 and UDF 2.60 discs. Also, logical volume integrity checking is now fixed,
  directory handling has been made more robust and UDF 2.50 and UDF 2.60 are now
  correctly signaled as read-only and won't try to corrupt a disc anymore.
  *cd\_disect* has been enhanced and extended to also support BluRay
  recorders.
* [UDFclient.0.7.1](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.7.1.tgz) :
  Fix Linux compilation issues.
* [UDFclient.0.7.0](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.7.0.tgz) :
  Enhance UDFclient with ideas and features from my NetBSD kernel implementation
  enhancing directory operations and fixing potential lockups on 512
  bytes/sector media, repaired NetBSD harddisc support and fixed a few
  compilation warnings when compiled with '-Wextra' revealing some possible
  bugs. Enhanced *cd\_disect* to display some more disc types. Also included
  some patches to fix possible buffer screwups; thanks Andrey!
* [UDFclient.0.6.3](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.6.3.tgz) :
  Implemented byteswapping option to allow *udfclient* to read and write
  PVR harddiscs who appear to be byteswapped for some reason (copy protection?).
  Also improved *udfdump* dumping making it handle big free space maps and
  allocation extensions and making *cd\_disect* ATAPI happy again.
* [UDFclient.0.6.2](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.6.2.tgz) :
  lots of enhancements to *cd\_discect*; now also reporting not only the TOC
  and the PMA, but also the ATIP. In this ATIP there is information on the CD-RW
  subtype wich is crucial to check if the disc can be written by the drive. Also
  fixing up yet another regression found on some DVD-R/CD-RW drives fixing
  *newfs\_udf* and *udfclient* writing on those drives. Complete
  harddisc/flash support on *Linux* apeared to be broken and should be
  fixed now.
* [UDFclient.0.6.1](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.6.1.tgz) :
  fix up yet another regression found on modern CD-RW drives when dealing with
  CD-MRW media. It would report them as sequential.
* [UDFclient.0.6.0](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.6.0.tgz) :
  fix regressions found in newer DVD/CD combi drives that report bogus values
  for CD-RW media and fix 2G+ file write problems on some platforms. This fixes
  hese drives inability to newfs a CD-RW with *newfs\_udf* and writing
  problems with *udfclient* on CD-RW media.
* [UDFclient.0.5.8](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.8.tgz) :
  fixes a nasty locking assertion error, improves error handling on mounting
  multi-session discs and fix a small printing error in *cd\_discect* for
  audio CD's.
* [UDFclient.0.5.7](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.7.tgz) :
  fix for Microsoft Vista formatted media that has a perculiar partition
  numbering scheme that confused UDFclient. Also minor cosmetic changes to make
  it less dependent on gcc's C extensions.
* [UDFclient.0.5.6](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.6.tgz) :
  important fixes in VAT searching on CD-R/DVD\*R allowing more discs to be read.
  Also better dumping of TOC's in *cd\_discect* and sequential dumping of
  files using a different sectorsize than the media allowing disc images of CD's
  to be dumped.
* [UDFclient.0.5.5](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.5.tgz) :
  Support for *reading* UDF 2.50/2.60 media! This also adds support for all
  HDDVD and BluRay media! Also small but important fixes have been made on
  *cd\_disect* for ATAPI drives; these could give up in the process.
* [UDFclient.0.5.4.1](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.4.1.tgz)
  : Fix small but important bug that crept into the 0.5.4 releasing !
* [UDFclient.0.5.4](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.4.tgz) :
  New in this release is support for harddisc partitions on NetBSD, OpenBSD and
  Linux. Have to figure out FreeBSD still. Tips welcome! Also new is support for
  USB sticks! As usual small bugs here and there are fixed.
* [UDFclient.0.5.3](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.3.tgz) :
  recommended upgrade that fixes some nitty-gritty standards compliance issues
  and a better recordable/VAT search algorithm parameters.
* [UDFclient.0.5.2](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.2.tgz) :
  recommended upgrade that fixes memory corruption bugs and obscure deadlocks
  making it a lot more robust. Functional identical to release 0.5.1.
* [UDFclient.0.5.1](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.1.tgz) :
  recommended upgrade that also fixes a lot of small bugs. New in this release
  are the preservation of attribute times and ownership of files and directories
  and an important fix to filesize related issues making it more robust. Some
  important SCSI/ATAPI fixes have been made that greatly increase drive
  compatibility.
* [UDFclient.0.5](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.5.tgz) :
  featuring a SCSI layer rewrite, CD-MRW and DVD+MRW support, new scsi/atapi
  format utility, more support for customer DVD (video) recorder DVDs and lots
  of bug fixes. **Please** do test this version and report strange behaviour
  0.4.9 didn't show and report any problems!
* [UDFclient.0.4.9](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.4.9.tgz) :
  recommended upgrade since it fixes lots of interchange issues and is now fully
  read & write compatible with Roxio's DirectCD/Drag2Disc! See the [tips and trics](#tips_and_tricks) for more details. It also adds the
  modified *get* and *put* functionality as well as the new
  *mget* and *mput* commands. In the run-up for 0.50's recordable
  support i've taken the opportunity to clean up loose ends and long standing
  small issues like the *rm* printing bug. Support has also been created
  for non 2048 bytes media such as harddiscs and files. **Note:** UDFclient
  will automatically set its sectorsize to the media used, so you have to use
  the new *-b 2048* to be able to read and write files used for testing and
  mastering.
* [UDFclient.0.4.5](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.4.5.tgz) :
  serious cleanup and bugfix release fixing serious `mkdir' brokenness and
  introducing a more decent logical volume open/close behaviour with coupled
  logical volume integrity sequence support that was lacking. Discs opened
  read-only are now really read-only; one could delete files from a read-only
  disc that could result in broken discs.
* [UDFclient.0.4](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.4.tgz) : major
  upgrade to the 0.3 series due to a structural rebuild of main engine based on
  insights gained from developing version 0.3. Pitty enough still no recordable
  media *write* support (sorry folks...). Significant speed improvements
  have been made in both reading and writing heaps of little files. Offcource
  also heaps of bug fixes. Work has also started on an in-kernel implementation
  though i decided to get UDFclient fully functional first. New in this version
  is support for non 2048 byte media using the *-b* flag, new `rename' and
  `free' commands in udfclient and a fixed and hopefully full working `rm'
  command. **Warning** some flags have been changed meaning so check your
  scripts!
* [UDFclient.0.3.5](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.3.5.tgz) :
  patch release fixing a **serious** memory leak.
* [UDFclient.0.3.4](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.3.4.tgz) :
  small patch release; support for OpenBSD and some small bug fixes.
* [UDFclient.0.3.3](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.3.3.tgz) :
  patch release fixing SCSI/ATAPI issue's, `rm' lockup and various small
  bugfixes. Recommended to use this one over version 0.3.2.
* [UDFclient.0.3.2](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.3.2.tgz) : a
  patch release consisting of various bugfixes, a proper configure script to
  ease compiling on various systems, FreeBSD CAM support, cdrw\_format tool and
  finally access rights preservation. Ownership of files is recorded but is not
  restored yet since i first want to check security hazzards induced by
  this.
* [UDFclient.0.3](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.3.tgz) :
  expirimental writing support to files and CD-RW/DVD+RW !!. Reads
  CD-R/CD-RW/DVD+R/DVD+RW/(DVD-R?)/(DVD-RW?) UDF versions 1.02, 1.50, and 2.01.
  Accompanied is a udf-volume formatter `newfs\_udf' that creates a filingsystem
  on a formatted media or file. NOTE: use `-W' flag to enable writing in
  `udfclient' itself and use `-d2' in `newfs\_udf' to force a filingsystem
  compatible upto 1.50.
* [UDFclient.0.2](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.2.tgz) : major
  sanitising release fixing various compatibility issues and important file
  reading fixes. Regretfully UDFv2.50 is temporary disabled but no discs are
  known to be formatted by this standard yet.
* [UDFclient.0.1p2](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.0.1p2.tgz) :
  patch release fixing compilation errors on newer NetBSD-current systems and
  providing Linux users with *mode sense* information when SCSI errors
  occure.
* [UDFclient-ro1-p1](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.ro1-p1.tgz) :
  patch release fixing a compilation error on some 32 bit architectures.
* [UDFclient-ro1](/udfclient/releases/UDFclient.ro1.tgz) : first
  release featuring read-only access to ATAPI/SCSI discs and image files.

## Bugs and problem reporting

No obvious problems or bugs are known; it can read corrupted discs but it
might fail at times.

**Update** DirectCD/Drag2Disc will now read and write discs formatted with UDFclient
fine! Older DirectCD/Drag2Disc versions might only accept media formatted with
the *-2* option.

Feedback is much apreciated also when its running fine!; please do mail me
about any failure of disc reading with a small report to reinoud@netbsd.org consisting of the
following points (replace *"/dev/cdrom"* by the device or file you used):

* UDFclient version
* The operating system UDFclient is running on
  ```
  uname -a
  ```
* Device report
  ```
  cd_disect /dev/cdrom
  ```
  and
  ```
  cd_sessions /dev/cdrom
  ```
* Logical dump of offending disc/file
  ```
  udfdump -D -u3 -t /dev/cdrom
  ```

## Tips and tricks

Resqueing files and directories from unreadable, incomplete or
broken recordables can be done by using the *-r* flag. By using the
*cd\_sessions* command you can see the number of CD/DVD sessions the disc
has and specify wich session(s) you would like to give a try. These can be
seen as older snapshots of the disc.

Roxio DirectCD/Drag2Disc interoperatibility. Newer DirectCD/Drag2Disc versions
that support UDF version 2.00 and higher will happily read and write media
created by UDFclient and vice versa. Older versions might only be able to read
and write UDFclient discs created with the *-2* flag that forces it to
use older descriptors.

Important for DirectCD/Drag2Disc is to select in the advanced eject
settings of DirectCD/Drag2Disc the option "use UDF version used on current
disc". It will otherwise try to use a mechanism that is breaking certain UDF
rules in order to try to be more compatible with older customer
appliances.

TinyUDF interoperatibility. TinyUDF is known to be in certain appliances
and its discs can be read in fine.

## TODO
UDFClient TODO list after 0.5 release :

* if possible, write support for recordable media (CD-R, DVD+/-R).
* userID, groupID restoration; its recorded now but not restored back.
  (security issues?)
* not only looking for errors but also repairing them : fsck\_udf
* write support for metadata partitions in UDF 2.50/2.60
* ...
