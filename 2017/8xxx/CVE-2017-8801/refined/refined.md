Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2017-8801:

**CVE-2017-8801**: While the CVE ID itself is a placeholder, the provided content describes security vulnerabilities addressed in a Trend Micro OfficeScan patch, which are likely related to the CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The "Website blocked by Trend Micro OfficeScan" alert page displayed by the OfficeScan agent's Web Reputation Service (WRS) was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Password Leakage:** Encrypted account passwords could be exposed during web console operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The alert page was vulnerable to XSS attacks, potentially allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed within a user's browser context.
*   **Insecure Password Handling:**  The system was not securely handling encrypted account passwords during web console operations, potentially leading to their exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the "Website blocked" alert page. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Password Leakage:** If an unauthorized user obtained the leaked encrypted passwords, they could potentially log in to the OfficeScan server console, gaining administrative access and potentially compromising the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious code into the "Website blocked" alert page through various means including manipulating user inputs.
*   **Password Leakage:** An attacker could intercept the encrypted passwords during web console operations. The document doesn't specify the exact mechanism of leakage, but it indicates a flaw in the web console password handling process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into the WRS alert page, possibly by controlling parts of user input or through another vulnerability.
*   **Password Leakage:** An attacker would need to intercept web console traffic in order to acquire leaked encrypted passwords. This could involve network sniffing or other unauthorized access means.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The patch addresses an issue where the OfficeScan agent program may block access to a website by displaying a blocked page.
*   The document indicates that the patch updates the OfficeScan agent program to improve its self-protection mechanism against local attackers injecting malicious code.
*   The patch includes updated files for both server and agent components.
