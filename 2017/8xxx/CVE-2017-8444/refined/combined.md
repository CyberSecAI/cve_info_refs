**Elastic Cloud Enterprise unsecured communication (ESA-2017-13)**

The client-forwarder in Elastic Cloud Enterprise versions prior to 1.0.2 do not properly encrypt traffic to ZooKeeper. If an attacker is able to man in the middle (MITM) the traffic between the client-forwarder and ZooKeeper they could potentially obtain sensitive data.

**Affected Versions:** ECE 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

All Elastic Cloud Enterprise users should upgrade to version 1.0.2. There is no known workaround for this issue.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8444

I am new to Elastic Cloud enterprise,

I have succesfully installed elastic cloud enterprise on centos machines, but when i restarted the machine, i am trying to access the UI and i am unable to access it, hence i went a head with installation and got the below error.

Is there a way to come out of this issues after the reboot

The install failed because you weren't quite thorough enough in cleansing the old install - see <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-uninstall.html>

(Reboot should work fine, so do post here if it fails after a reboot once you've gotten the install up again)

Yes, ok may i ask how to check the status of the elastic cloud or restart the service once the virtual instance is restarted

Could you give more details on what you are after? The docker service should restart all the required ECE services on reboot

The UI will report the status of the platform (it uses an undocumented -but easily reverse-engineerable- legacy API to do this currently, though the documented one is coming soon)

Sorry for not replying, was tied up for a few days

> In what cases Elastic cloud enterprise is charged to customers, i have installed elastic cloud enterprise in two nodes wondering in what cases we will be charged

The download gives a free trial, after that you need to get licenses -[Have questions? Contact Elastic | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/contact)

> where are the zone's in elastic cloud enterprise, how to check the zones

When you add new hosts you can specify the zones: see `--availability-zone` [elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh install | Elastic Cloud Enterprise Reference [3.6] | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-installation-script.html)

> to add more nodes, i am specifying it as coordinator nodes and adding them, could you pls help me with the node roles

you can install with no roles and then add them from the UI (platform > runner)m see [Assign roles to hosts | Elastic Cloud Enterprise Reference [3.6] | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-change-roles.html), or more details on how to use roles are: [Generate roles tokens | Elastic Cloud Enterprise Reference [2.1] | Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/2.1/ece-generate-roles-token.html)

> How does backup works in elastic cloud enterprise

There's ES and ECE level backup. For ES backup we use snapshots to either S3, GCP, Azure, or minio (which can store locally or act as a gateway to other store)

For ECE backup a "proper" disaster recovery is in the works. Currently running multi-zone is the main protection. We have worked with customers through support to help people integrate our "alpha" backup and restore into their own environment

> In what cases is elastic cloud enterprise is choosen eg:- any data size could you please specify, I understand that the use cases may vary just an example could help

Generally the main benefits of ECE come with:

* being able to provision and manage elements of the stack via a UI
* being able to provision and manage multiple deployments

So our -obviously biased!- claim would be that ECE is a great choice for almost any production environment ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Hi Alex,

Thanks a lot for your response,

I am getting an error "Certificate chain was invalid [Invalid Entry: expected unencrypted rsa private key]"

then i encrypted using the

openssl rsa -in server.key -out server\_new.key

iam getting another error "Certificate chain was invalid [Missing Entry: expected at least server and CA certificates]"

Could you please help here
