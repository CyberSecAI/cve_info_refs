Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-8224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a backdoor account present in the firmware of the affected Wireless IP Cameras.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Backdoor Account:** A hardcoded root account (`root:$1$ybdHbPDn$ii9aEIFNiolBbM9QxW9mr0:0:0::/root:/bin/sh`) exists in the device's firmware.
- **Telnet Service:** The telnet daemon (telnetd) is enabled by default on the camera.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Access:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability gives the attacker a root shell on the device, allowing complete control over the system.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could access sensitive configuration data, modify settings, and potentially use the compromised camera as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the camera, either on the local network or remotely if the device is exposed to the internet.
- **Telnet:** The attacker connects to the camera's telnet service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the camera on the network.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the default credentials (which in this case was the backdoor account), or try the default `admin` login.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The extracted content also discusses other vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-8222, CVE-2017-8225, CVE-2017-8223, CVE-2017-8221) in the same cameras, including an information leak, remote code execution, and issues with the "Cloud" functionality. However, this analysis is focused specifically on CVE-2017-8224.
*   The content includes a proof of concept exploit that combines multiple vulnerabilities to achieve pre-auth root RCE, however the CVE-2017-8224 is exploited directly through telnet.
*   The content provides a list of potentially vulnerable camera models, which provides additional context around the scope of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerabilities are located in a custom version of GoAhead HTTP server modified by the OEM vendor.
