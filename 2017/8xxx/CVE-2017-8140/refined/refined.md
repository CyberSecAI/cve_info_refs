Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `soundtrigger` driver of some Huawei smartphones, specifically a memory double-free issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory double free vulnerability: The driver attempts to free the same memory location twice, leading to a corrupted memory state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- System crash: The double free can corrupt memory and cause the device to crash.
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious application: The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application.
- Multiple threads: The malicious application exploits the vulnerability by starting multiple threads and trying to free the specific memory location concurrently.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to convince the user to install the malicious application.
- The malicious application runs locally on the device to trigger the double-free vulnerability.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the specific memory allocation and freeing mechanism within the vulnerable driver.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified by `HWPSIRT-2017-03198`.
- The affected product is the `P9 Plus` with versions earlier than `VIE-AL10BC00B353` and is fixed in version `VIE-AL10BC00B353`.
- The vulnerability was reported to Huawei PSIRT by Yonggang Guo of IceSword Lab, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 6.7 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- The CVSS v3 temporal score is 6.2 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C).
- The attack complexity is high due to the need to trigger the double free by a specific timing and order of execution of free calls.
