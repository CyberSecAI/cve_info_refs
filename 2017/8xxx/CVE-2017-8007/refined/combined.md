ESA-2017-081:  EMC ViPR SRM, EMC Storage M&R, EMC VNX M&R, EMC M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs Multiple
Vulnerabilities

EMC Identifier: ESA-2017-081
CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-8007, CVE-2017-8012
Severity Rating: CVSS Base Score:  See below for individual scores.

Affected products:
*       EMC ViPR SRM all versions
*       EMC Storage M&R all versions
*       EMC VNX M&R all versions
*       EMC M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs all versions

Summary:
EMC ViPR  SRM, EMC Storage M&R, EMC VNX M&R, EMC M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs  contain multiple
vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system.

Details:
*       Directory Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8007)
Webservice Gateway used in these products is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Attackers with knowledge
of Webservice Gateway credentials could potentially exploit this vulnerability to access unauthorized information, and
modify or delete data by supplying specially crafted strings in input parameters of the web service call.

CVSSv3 Base Score:  8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

*       JMX Denial of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8012)
The Java Management Extensions (JMX) protocol used to communicate between components in the Alerting and/or Compliance
components in these products can be leveraged to create a denial of service (DoS) condition. Attackers with knowledge
of JMX  agent user credentials could potentially exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary files on the affected
system and create a DoS condition by leveraging inherent JMX protocol capabilities.

CVSSv3 Base Score:  7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

Resolution:

Mitigation information for CVE-2017-8007:
*       EMC ViPR SRM customers: Upgrade to EMC ViPR SRM version 4.1
*       EMC Storage M&R customers: Upgrade to EMC Storage M&R version 4.1
*       EMC M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs customers: Apply EMC M&R 6.7.x fix for Directory Traversal
Vulnerability Update Package
*       EMC VNX M&R customers:  Migrate to EMC Storage M&R version 4.1
*       All customers are strongly advised to change any default WebService Gateway credentials.  Please see
ESA-2017-089 for more details on how to change the credentials.
*       Customers are strongly advised to review product documentation and use firewall controls to limit access to
WebService Gateway and all other internal ports only to those servers that require access to them.
o       For vApp installations, please review Knowledge Base article 503844 (<https://support.emc.com/kb/503844>) for
guidance on making firewall changes within the vApp.

Mitigation information for CVE-2017-8012 for all customers:
*       Change any default JMX agent credentials. Please see ESA-2017-089 for more details on how to change the
credentials.

ports only to those servers that require access to them.
o       For vApp installations, please review Knowledge Base article 503844 (<https://support.emc.com/kb/503844>) for
guidance on making firewall changes within the vApp.
*       Future releases will contain further measures to remove or harden communication via the JMX protocol. EMC VNX
M&R customers must migrate to EMC Storage M&R version 4.1 or later to receive future security fixes.
