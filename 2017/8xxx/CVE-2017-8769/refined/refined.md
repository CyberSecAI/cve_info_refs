Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-8769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WhatsApp Messenger for Android application does not delete sent and received media files (audio, documents, images, videos, voice notes) from the SD card when chats are cleared, deleted, or when the application is uninstalled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Data Persistence:** Media files are persistently stored on the SD card even after the user deletes the associated chat, clears all chats or uninstalls the application.
2.  **Lack of Encryption:** Media files are stored unencrypted on the SD card, making them accessible to any application with storage permissions.
3.  **Insufficient Data Handling:**  The application does not provide proper controls for users to delete all media files. While a "delete media" checkbox was added later, it does not always work as expected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Privacy Breach:** Sensitive media files (private photos, videos, documents, etc.) can be exposed to unauthorized third parties.
2.  **Data Theft:** Malicious applications with storage permissions can access and steal the user's media files.
3. **Access by Law enforcement/unwanted actors**: Law enforcement agencies or other actors with access to the physical device can access the data during illegal searches or other scenarios.
4.  **"Evil Maid" Scenario:** Unauthorized individuals with physical access to the device can obtain access to user's media files.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Malicious Applications:** An attacker can create a malicious Android application that requests storage permissions to gain access to the WhatsApp media directory.
2.  **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the device can use a file manager application to browse the SD card and access the media files.
3.  **Data Recovery:** Even if the device is wiped, files may still be recoverable from the flash storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Malicious Application:** Ability to develop and deploy an Android application to a victim's device. This can be achieved via malicious app stores, phishing or other social engineering methods.
2.  **Physical Access:** The attacker has physical access to an unlocked or compromised device.
3.  **Basic knowledge of the file system** The attacker needs a basic understanding of file paths to locate and extract the files.
4. **Storage permission**: Any application with the storage permission can read files from the location.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was initially reported to Facebook in April 2017, and they initially stated they did not consider it a security issue and had no plans to fix it.
*   A UI update added an option to delete media files, but this mitigation is not reliable as the checkbox to delete media does not always work, thus a user still needs to manually delete the files from the SD card.
*   The issue affects WhatsApp for Android. It is unclear if other platforms are affected.
*   The vendor, Facebook, has refused to acknowledge it as a security issue, and doesn't plan to fix it.
