Debian Bug     : 895245 862450 949583 969529 949582

Several security vulnerabilities were corrected in libxml2, the GNOME
XML library.

CVE-2017-8872

    Global buffer-overflow in the htmlParseTryOrFinish function.

CVE-2017-18258

    The xz_head function in libxml2 allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted LZMA file,
    because the decoder functionality does not restrict memory usage to
    what is required for a legitimate file.

CVE-2018-14404

    A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the
    xpath.c:xmlXPathCompOpEval() function of libxml2 when parsing an
    invalid XPath expression in the XPATH_OP_AND or XPATH_OP_OR case.
    Applications processing untrusted XSL format inputs may be
    vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

CVE-2018-14567

    If the option --with-lzma is used, allows remote attackers to cause
    a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted XML file.

CVE-2019-19956

    The xmlParseBalancedChunkMemoryRecover function has a memory leak
    related to newDoc->oldNs.

CVE-2019-20388

    A memory leak was found in the xmlSchemaValidateStream function of
    libxml2. Applications that use this library may be vulnerable to
    memory not being freed leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2020-7595

    Infinite loop in xmlStringLenDecodeEntities can cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2020-24977

    Out-of-bounds read restricted to xmllint --htmlout.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

For the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

I think with more context around your patch, there's this:  	if ((avail == 0) && (terminate)) { 	    htmlAutoCloseOnEnd(ctxt); 	    if ((ctxt->nameNr == 0) && (ctxt->instate != XML_PARSER_EOF)) { 		/* 		 * SAX: end of the document processing. 		 */ 		ctxt->instate = XML_PARSER_EOF; 		if ((ctxt->sax) && (ctxt->sax->endDocument != NULL)) 		    ctxt->sax->endDocument(ctxt->userData);  >               goto done; 	    } 	}         if (avail < 1) 	    goto done;  Either avail == 0 or avail != 0.  If avail == 0, then also avail < 1 and that last goto statement will run.  If avail != 0, then the goto statement you are adding won't run because of the if ((avail == 0) && ... statement that surrounds it. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=775200#c7)  Marcus Meissner    2017-07-13 15:31:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 355527](attachment.cgi?id=355527 "xx.pat") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=355527&action=edit "xx.pat") [[review]](review?bug=775200&attachment=355527) xx.pat  this makes xmlHaltParser "empty" the buffer, as it resets cur and avail too here.  this seems to cure this specific issue, and also passes the testsuite ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=775200#c8)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2017-12-14 19:31:45 UTC  ``` Any updates on this issue? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=775200#c9)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2018-01-02 12:32:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 366193](attachment.cgi?id=366193 "Out-of-bounds read in htmlParseTryOrFinish (CVE-2017-8872)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=366193&action=edit "Out-of-bounds read in htmlParseTryOrFinish (CVE-2017-8872)") [[review]](review?bug=775200&attachment=366193) Out-of-bounds read in htmlParseTryOrFinish (CVE-2017-8872)  Hi  The issue is not yet fixed up to master (as per ad88b54f1a28a8565964a370b5d387927b633c0d) and the patch from Marcus in [Comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=775200#c7) does not apply anymore cleanly as Mattia Rizzolo correctly noted in the Debian Bug <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=862450#22>.
