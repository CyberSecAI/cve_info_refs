Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-8872:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `htmlParseTryOrFinish` function within the `HTMLparser.c` file of the libxml2 library.
*   The issue arises when the parser reaches the maximum depth limit (`xmlParserMaxDepth`) and `xmlHaltParser` is called.
*   `xmlHaltParser` sets `ctxt->input->base` and `ctxt->input->cur` to the same pointer, which is not related to the buffer itself (`in->buf->buffer`).
*   Subsequently, the `htmlParseTryOrFinish` function calculates `avail` using `xmlBufUse(in->buf->buffer) - (in->cur - in->base)`. Because `in->cur` and `in->base` are equal and not related to the buffer, the calculation leads to a global buffer overflow

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Global Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a global buffer overflow due to incorrect calculation of available buffer space after `xmlHaltParser` is invoked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash due to the buffer overflow, as reported by AddressSanitizer.
*   **Potential Denial of Service:** While the provided information emphasizes the crash, a buffer overflow could potentially be exploited for more severe outcomes like arbitrary code execution under certain conditions, which could lead to denial of service, although this is not explicitly stated in these reports

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed HTML Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted, deeply nested HTML input. The crafted input causes the parser depth to exceed `xmlParserMaxDepth`.
*   **HTML Parsing:** The attack vector is through the HTML parsing functionality of libxml2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HTML document to an application that uses libxml2 for HTML parsing. This could occur via processing web pages, parsing HTML files etc.
*   **No special privileges:** The vulnerability does not require any elevated privileges and can be triggered by supplying a crafted HTML document

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report indicates that the overflow was found using AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) fuzzer and AddressSanitizer.
*   Several patches were proposed, with the final fix involving proper resetting of the buffer pointers within `xmlHaltParser` function to prevent calculation errors.
*   The issue was also reported and discussed on Debian's bug tracking system (mentioned in comment 9).
