Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2017-8421:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how `binutils/objdump` handles extended relocations in Portable Executable (PE) files. Specifically, when a PE section contains extended relocations, the `reloc_count` for a section is derived from the `r_vaddr` field of the first relocation entry. This `r_vaddr` is a 32-bit unsigned long and is used to calculate the size of memory that needs to be allocated. A malicious PE file can provide an arbitrary large value in `r_vaddr`, causing `objdump` to attempt to allocate an excessively large memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow/Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The `reloc_count` is taken from an attacker-controlled field within the PE file. This value is then used in the calculation of memory allocation size. By providing a very large number in that field, an attacker can trigger an attempt to allocate a huge memory block, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:** There is no validation on the `reloc_count` to ensure that it is within reasonable bounds before allocating memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. By crafting a malicious PE file, an attacker can cause `objdump` to attempt allocating a huge amount of memory, leading to memory exhaustion and crashing the program.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PE File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PE file. This file includes an extended relocation entry where the `r_vaddr` field is set to a large value to trigger excessive memory allocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PE file to the vulnerable `binutils/objdump` tool. This can be achieved by enticing a user to open or process this file with the vulnerable tool.
- The attacker does not require any prior access to the system, as the vulnerability is triggered by processing the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided sourceware.org bug report includes code snippets illustrating the vulnerability, as well as the patch which addresses this vulnerability by adding a size check.
* Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that this is a remote exploitable vulnerability, which can cause a denial of service
* The fix involves adding a check to verify if the calculated relocation size is larger than the size of the file itself, which would indicate an invalid relocation table.

This is a clear case of a vulnerability due to inadequate validation and bounds checking, leading to a DoS condition.
