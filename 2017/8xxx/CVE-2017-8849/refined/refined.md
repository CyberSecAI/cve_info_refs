{
  "CVE-2017-8849": {
    "Description": "Smb4k contains a logic flaw in which the mount helper binary does not properly verify the mount command it is being asked to run. This allows calling any other binary as root since the mount helper is typically installed as suid.",
    "Root cause": "The mount helper binary does not properly verify the mount command it is being asked to run.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation in the mount helper binary.",
      "The mount helper is installed as suid, allowing any user to execute it with root privileges."
   ],
    "Impact": "A local user can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local execution of the suid mount helper binary with crafted arguments"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute local commands",
       "Ability to craft specific arguments"
    ],
    "Affected versions": [
      "smb4k <= 2.0.0",
      "smb4k < 1.2.3-r1"
    ],
    "Patches": [
     "smb4k 2.0.1",
     "smb4k 2.0.0: https://commits.kde.org/smb4k/a90289b0962663bc1d247bbbd31b9e65b2ca000e",
     "smb4k 1.2.3: https://commits.kde.org/smb4k/71554140bdaede27b95dbe4c9b5a028a83c83cce"
   ],
   "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered via the KAuth framework's performAction() method which allows a user to spoof the callerID. This bypasses polkit checks, then passes user-supplied arguments to the root helper program, where they are executed without proper validation."
