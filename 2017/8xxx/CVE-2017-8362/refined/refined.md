Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-8362:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the `flac_buffer_copy` function in `flac.c`. This occurs when processing a crafted FLAC audio file. Specifically, the issue arises when the number of channels changes between frames.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `flac_buffer_copy` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when the number of channels changes between frames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The out-of-bounds read can cause a crash due to a segmentation fault (SEGV), as seen in the provided ASan output.
- **Unspecified other impacts:** The Gentoo advisory mentions "other unspecified impacts" are possible, but doesn't provide details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Audio File:** The vulnerability is triggered by enticing a user to open a specially crafted audio file, specifically a FLAC file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote since the attack vector involves a user opening a crafted file.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious audio file.

**Additional details:**
