Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `ReadPCDImage` function in `coders/pcd.c` of ImageMagick. This function is responsible for processing PCD (Photo CD) image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary issue is a memory leak. The `ReadPCDImage` function allocates memory but fails to properly free it under certain conditions when processing a crafted PCD file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly trigger the memory leak by providing maliciously crafted PCD files, eventually exhausting available memory and causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted PCD file. This file can be provided as input to ImageMagick via various means (e.g., command-line arguments, web uploads).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted PCD file to ImageMagick.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability; it can be exploited by anyone who can invoke ImageMagick with a malicious file.
- The attacker does not require any special network access to exploit the vulnerability, as the attack vector involves providing a crafted file as input.

**Additional details:**

- The GitHub issue report ([https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/448](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/448)) provides specific details about the memory leak, including a stack trace showing the allocation chain and a test case.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3863-1 confirms that CVE-2017-8351 is a vulnerability in ImageMagick which can lead to denial of service due to memory handling issues.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a PCD file.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using the `#identify` command with a crafted PCD file.
- A test case is available in the provided github link, which is `https://github.com/bestshow/p0cs/blob/master/memory-leak-in-ReadPCDImage-9.pcd`.
