Based on the provided information, the content relates to **CVE-2017-8359**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in gRPC where a call was not properly removed from a sibling list when it was not the first child.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of call removal from a sibling list when it's not the first child. This can lead to memory corruption or other undefined behaviors when the list is accessed after the incorrect removal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The provided content indicates that the vulnerability led to issues identified by oss-fuzz, specifically, issues 957 and 726 on the chromium bug tracker. While the specifics aren't provided, this typically relates to crashes, memory corruption, or other abnormal program behavior due to the incorrect handling of the data structure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending gRPC requests that trigger the scenario where a call is not the first child in a sibling list, and then triggers removal of that call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to send gRPC requests to a server that uses the vulnerable code.
