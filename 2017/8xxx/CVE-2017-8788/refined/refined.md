  "cve": "CVE-2017-8788",
  "description": "The provided content details a CRLF injection vulnerability in Accellion FTA before FTA_9_12_180.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from unsanitized input in `settings_global_text_edit.php`. The script uses the `$_GET['display']` or `$_POST['display']` parameters directly in a `header('Location: ...)` call without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CRLF Injection",
      "Unsanitized user input"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the HTTP response, potentially leading to various attacks such as session fixation or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected content is interpreted by the browser.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to `settings_global_text_edit.php` with a `display` parameter containing CRLF characters (e.g., `?display=x%0Dnewline`), an attacker can inject arbitrary headers.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET or POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as required."
