{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of the required buffer size for UTF-8 encoding within the Chakra JavaScript engine. Specifically, the code calculates `cbUtf8Buffer` as `(cchSource + 1) * 3` where `cchSource` is the length of the source string. When `cchSource` is sufficiently large, this calculation can overflow, leading to a smaller-than-required buffer allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to heap overflow.",
      "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient buffer size."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to a crash when the out-of-bounds write occurs.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a very long string and passing it to the JavaScript `eval()` function. The `eval` function uses the vulnerable `DefaultEvalHelper` to process the input string.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within Microsoft Edge, typically by loading a malicious webpage."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by creating a very long string and passing it to the eval function in Microsoft Edge."
