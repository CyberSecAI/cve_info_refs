Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of parameter checks in the call module of certain Huawei smartphones. Specifically, the call module does not properly validate input parameters, leading to exploitable behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper validation of parameters sent to the call module. This allows an attacker to send crafted parameters to trigger a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the crashing of the call and data communication process on the affected device. This leads to a temporary denial of service, disrupting the user's ability to make calls or use data services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into installing a malicious application on their smartphone. This application then exploits the vulnerability by sending specific crafted parameters to the vulnerable call module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Application Creation:** The attacker needs to develop a malicious application capable of sending the crafted parameters.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to install the malicious application. This typically requires some level of social engineering or misleading tactics.
*   **Local Access (Indirect):** While the vulnerability is triggered locally on the device, the attacker doesn't have to be physically present. They achieve local access through the malicious app.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified by the internal Huawei IDs HWPSIRT-2017-06008 and HWPSIRT-2017-06009, with CVE-2017-8145 assigned to one of the issues.
*   The affected devices include Huawei P10 and P10 Plus models with specific software versions.
*   The fix involves updating the phone's software to the versions listed in the advisory.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Erez Yalon of Checkmarx.
*   The CVSSv3 base score is 5.5 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H), indicating a moderate severity.
