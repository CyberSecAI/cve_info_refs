Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `simpleupload.py` script in the web interface of Tenable Appliance. Specifically, the `tns_appliance_session_user` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system through the vulnerable parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The web interface fails to sanitize user-supplied input, particularly the `tns_appliance_session_user` parameter, which enables the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the target appliance.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the appliance, including access to sensitive data, modification of configurations, and the potential to pivot to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `simpleupload.py` script with a malicious payload in the `tns_appliance_session_user` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Tenable Appliance's web interface.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit demonstrates that this vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter `tns_appliance_session_user` to inject the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Tenable Appliance versions 3.5 through 4.4.0, and possibly prior versions.
- An exploit for this vulnerability was publicly released on 2017-04-18, increasing the urgency for applying the patch.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS v2 base score of 10 and CVSS v3 base score of 9.8.
- The fix for this issue is included in Tenable Appliance version 4.5.0.
- The provided exploit uses `curl` to send a request to the vulnerable script and `netcat` to listen for the reverse shell.
