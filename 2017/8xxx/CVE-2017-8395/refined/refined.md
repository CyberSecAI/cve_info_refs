Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the return value of `bfd_malloc` within the `bfd_init_section_compress_status` function in `compress.c`.  If `bfd_malloc` fails to allocate memory, it returns a null pointer. The code then attempts to dereference this null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Null pointer dereference
- Lack of error handling: The code does not check the return value of `bfd_malloc` before using the returned pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service: Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault, causing the `objcopy` program to crash, effectively creating a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Crafted input file: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted ELF binary file to the `objcopy` tool, specifically when used with the `--compress-debug-section` flag. This crafted file will cause `bfd_malloc` to fail in a specific scenario, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted input file to the vulnerable `objcopy` tool.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and Valgrind.
- The fix involves adding a check for the return value of `bfd_malloc` to prevent null pointer dereference.
- The vulnerable code is within the `binutils` package, specifically the `objcopy` tool.
- Affected versions: binutils versions before 2.28.1 are vulnerable.
- The exploit is remotely triggerable because a user can be enticed to process the crafted file.
