Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `salt-ssh` copies configuration files from the Salt Master to minions (clients). The `salt-ssh` minion code in SaltStack Salt versions prior to 2016.11.4 would copy configuration files without properly adjusting the permissions on the minion. This resulted in files, that should have been private, being created with world readable permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:**  Temporary files created by `salt-ssh` on the minion had insecure permissions (0644), making them world-readable. This included files that may contain sensitive data, like private keys.
- **Incorrect Permission Inheritance:** The permissions were inherited from the Salt Master or the gitfs cache, which could also have had incorrect permissions. Specifically, if files originated from a gitfs backend, they might have had 0644 permissions in the master gitfs cache, exacerbating the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Local attackers on the targeted minion could potentially read sensitive information stored in the improperly permissioned files. This information could include credentials, private keys, or other sensitive configuration data.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** If an attacker were to obtain private keys, they may be able to use these to escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local to the minion (client) machine. An attacker would need to have local access to the minion to read the vulnerable files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on a minion where the `salt-ssh` is used.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not need high privileges, but would need to have access to the files to read them.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in SaltStack Salt version 2016.11.4. The fix includes setting the cache to 600, and looking up the file permissions at the time of placing the file down on the filesystem.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- The CVSS v4 base score is 8.5, with the vector being CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N.
- The exploitability metrics show it's a local attack with low complexity, no attack requirements, low privileges required, and no user interaction needed.
- The impact metrics indicate high confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks for the vulnerable system.
