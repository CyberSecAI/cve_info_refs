{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the fact that processes within a LightDM guest session are not being confined by the /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-guest-session AppArmor profile when systemd is used for user session management. This occurs in Ubuntu 16.10 and later releases where systemd replaced upstart for user sessions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Lack of AppArmor confinement for guest session processes",
    "Incorrect handling of user session confinement when using systemd"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A physically proximate attacker can bypass intended AppArmor restrictions within a guest session, gaining access to files and resources they should not be able to access. This includes the ability to potentially read files in the home directories of other users on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the system is required.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have physical access to a vulnerable machine and be able to log into a guest session."
