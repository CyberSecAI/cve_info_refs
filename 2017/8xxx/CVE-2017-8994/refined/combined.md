# [R2] HPE Operations Orchestration Incomplete Fix for CVE-2016-8519

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable originally published the details of [CVE-2016-8519](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-17-001/), a Java deserialization vulnerability in HPE Operations Orchestrations, in [TRA-2017-05](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-05). The short version is that HPE Operations Orchestrations 10.60 was vulnerable to Java deserialization attacks through its web interface due to certain endpoints using [*HttpInvokerServiceExporter*](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/httpinvoker/HttpInvokerServiceExporter.html).

In order to fix CVE-2016-8519, HPE replaced their usage of *HttpInvokerServiceExporter* with a new class called *SecureHttpInvokerServiceExporter*. This new class creates a wrapper around the incoming *ObjectInputStream* to create a *LookAheadObjectInputStream*. At first glance, this *LookAheadObjectInputStream* appears to follow guidelines laid out by [Pierre Ernst](https://twitter.com/e_rnst) in the article *[Look-ahead Java deserialization](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-lookahead/)*. Specifically, *LookAheadObjectInputStream* contains an overridden *resolveClass* that has logic to verify the object that's about to be deserialized is of the type *[RemoteInvocation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/support/RemoteInvocation.html)*. However, the code is a little weird.

```

protected Class<?> resolveClass(ObjectStreamClass desc) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException
{
    if (logger.isDebugEnabled())
    {
        logger.debug("Entering resolveClass: firstTime=[" + this.firstTime + "] name=[" + desc.getName() + "]");
    }

    if ((this.firstTime) &&
        (!StringUtils.equals(desc.getName(), RemoteInvocation.class.getName())))
    {
        String message = "Unauthorized de-serialization attempt for class " + desc.getName();
        logger.error(message);
        throw new InvalidClassException(message);
    }

    this.firstTime = false;
    return super.resolveClass(desc);
}

```

Look at how the boolean member variable *firstTime* is used. This *resolveClass* implementation will only verify the first Object and after that it doesn't care. But maybe this isn't a mistake? Maybe *RemoteInvocation* won't ever have any inner objects to deserialize? [Wrong](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/remoting/support/RemoteInvocation.java).

```

public class RemoteInvocation implements Serializable
{
    /** use serialVersionUID from Spring 1.1 for interoperability */
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 6876024250231820554L;

    private String methodName;

    private Class<?>[] parameterTypes;

    private Object[] arguments;

    private Map<String, Serializable> attributes;

```

An attacker can stick arbitrary serializable objects into the *RemoteInvocation* attributes map. Which means the *resolveClass* implementation in the *LookAheadObjectInputStream* is arbitrary to bypass. Furthermore, an exploitable Apache Commons BeanUtils is on the classpath. Therefore, a remote unauthenticated attacker can still achieve remote code execution by sending HTTP POST requests to */oo/backwards-compatibility/wsExecutionBridgeService*.

### Solution

Upgrade to HPE Operations Orchestration 10.80

# [R1] HPE Operations Orchestration Central Remoting Java Deserialization Remote Code Execution

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

The *central-remoting* endpoints in HPE Operations Orchestration 10.70 all use the class *OOHttpInvokerServiceExporter* to handle requests. A properly crafted HTTP POST request to any of the following URLs will trigger deserialization of untrusted data in *OOHttpInvokerServiceExporter*:

* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/remoteDebuggerService
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/engineExecutionFacade
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/pauseResumeServiceSecuredProxy
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/mergedConfigurationService
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/platformDataService
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/executionEventService
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/runtimeValueService

* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/identityGenerator
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/workerDbSupportService
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/orchestratorDispatcherService
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/stepLogService
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/eventsRouter
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/m2ArtifactService
* http://[address]:8080/oo/central-remoting/dependencyService

However, unlike [TRA-2017-25](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-25), it isn't sufficient to simply POST a serialized object to any of the given URLs. The request needs to satisfy a couple of conditions:

1. The HTTP header must have a *TRAFFIC\_COMPRESSION\_ENABLED* field.
2. The first byte of the HTTP payload must be 0, 1, or 2. These values correspond to the type of compression used on the Java object. The corresponding values are, in order, none, gzip, and lz4.

The following is a proof of concept with builtin payloads for [CommonsBeanutils1 and FileUpload1](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial).
```

###
# This script is a PoC for an unauth RCE vuln in HP OO 10.70. The attacks
# is trigger via the webserver on 8080. Specifically, the URL used here is
# /oo/central-remoting/remoteDebuggerService . This script assumes that
# OO is not configured with SSL. The attack would still work with SSL
# but its extra work to code.
#
# There are two PoC payloads for this attack:
#
# The first uses Apache Commons BeanUtils in order to execute a
# command. For this PoC the command executed is
# "cmd /c mkdir C:\Users\Public\lolwat".
# The second payload uses Apache FileUpload.  For this PoC
# a file is written to C:\Users\Public\ with the contents
# "file upload exploited!" (the file will be deleted by
# java within a few seconds though) - note that FileUpload is best
# used to delete files, but I don't want to make a destructive PoC.
