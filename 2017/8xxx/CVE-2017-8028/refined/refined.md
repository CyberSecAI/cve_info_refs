{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Some LDAP vendors require an explicit operation for the LDAP bind to take effect. When using LDAP BindAuthenticator with org.springframework.ldap.core.support.DefaultTlsDirContextAuthenticationStrategy as the authentication strategy, and setting userSearch, authentication is allowed with an arbitrary password when the username is correct.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication bypass"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can authenticate with an arbitrary password when the username is correct, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability occurs when spring-ldap connects to certain LDAP servers, and when no additional attributes are bound, using LDAP BindAuthenticator with DefaultTlsDirContextAuthenticationStrategy and userSearch.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know a valid username. No specific privileges or network position are specified."
