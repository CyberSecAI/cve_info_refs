Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `kedpm` password manager stores command history in a plain text file at `~/.kedpm/history`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cleartext Storage:** Sensitive information is written to the history file without any encryption or obfuscation.
- **Command history logging:** All commands, including those containing sensitive data, are logged in cleartext.
- **Exposure of Master Password:** Specifically, using the `passwd` command with the new password as an argument directly logs the new master password in cleartext to the history file.
- **Exposure of password entry names:** Names of password entries created and consulted are also recorded in the cleartext history file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of master password:** If the user changes their master password via the command line and includes the new password as an argument, this password will be exposed in plaintext.
- **Disclosure of password entry names:** An attacker could learn the names of password entries managed by the user.
- **Confidential Information Disclosure:**  An attacker gaining access to the history file can obtain sensitive information stored within the password manager.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker with access to the user's system can directly read the `~/.kedpm/history` file.
- The Gentoo advisory also mentions the exploitability as "local, remote". The remote vector is not further explained in the provided content, but presumably refers to scenarios where an attacker could remotely gain access to the user's machine and its files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to user's filesystem:** An attacker needs to gain read access to the user's home directory or specifically the `~/.kedpm/history` file.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was present in versions 0.5 and 1.0 of `kedpm`.
- The Debian bug report includes a patch that removes the "passwd" entries from the history before writing to disk. The patch also modifies the `passwd` command to always prompt for password rather than accepting it as command argument.
- The `kedpm` software is considered abandoned by the maintainer, and users are encouraged to switch to other solutions.
- Gentoo recommends unmerging the vulnerable package.
- The Debian bug report also indicates a request to remove `kedpm` from Debian.
