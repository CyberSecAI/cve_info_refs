# CVE-2017-8296

| **Name** | CVE-2017-8296 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | kedpm 0.5 and 1.0 creates a history file in ~/.kedpm/history that is written in cleartext. All of the commands performed in the password manager are written there. This can lead to the disclosure of the master password if the "password" command is used with an argument. The names of the password entries created and consulted are also accessible in cleartext. |

Subject: kedpm: Information leak via the command history file

A vulnerability was discovered in the kedpm password manager that may
expose the master password when changed, if passed on the commandline.

Example, good:

kedpm> passwd
New password:
Repeat password:
Password changed.
kedpm>

Example, bad:

kedpm:/> passwd bar
Password changed

The former will show "passwd" in the ~/.kedpm/history file while the
latter will show "passwd bar" in the history file, divulging the
password in clear text.

Also, all password *names* that are created or consulted are saved in
the history file, something that users may not expect (although you have
to wonder how they thought history worked).

This is documented in the Debian bugtracker:

<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=860817>

But I would like to get a CVE assigned for wider diffusion.

Note that I seem to be the sole kedpm maintainer left and I consider the
software abandoned. I will backport patches to fix this in the Debian
bugtracker, but I have filed a request for the software to be removed
from Debian and all users should switch away.

Thanks,

a.

Source: kedpm
Version: 1.0
Severity: grave
Tags: upstream security
Justification: user security hole

Hello,

I've discovered an information leak that can give some hints about what ppl
search and read in the password manager.

kedpm is creating a history file in ~/.kedpm/history that is written in clear
text. All of the commands that are done in the password manager are writted
there.

This also means that if someone uses the "password" command with the password
as an argument to change the database's master password, the new password gets
leaked in plaintext to that file!

The issue was already reported upstream[0]. However, the upstream project seems
to be unmoving since a couple of years already.

[0]: <https://sourceforge.net/p/kedpm/bugs/6/>

I've discovered the bug in wheezy, so in 0.5.0 but the same problem applies to
later releases.

Control: tags -1 +patch

I have requested a CVE on the oss-security mailing list.

In the meantime, there's this patch that should apply to jessie and can
probably be backported to wheezy as well.

It simply removes the "passwd" entries from the history before it is
written to disk. It will not hide other password names that are created
or fetched from the database, but I consider that a minor issue that
doesn't warrant a full rearchitecture.

I have also requested complete removal of kedpm from sid/stretch, as it
is unmaintained, see #861277.

# Ked Password Manager: Information leak — GLSA **201708-04**

An insecure file usage has been reported in Ked Password Manager
possibly allowing confidential information to be disclosed.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/kedpm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.4.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

Helps to manage large numbers of passwords and related information and
simplifies the tasks of searching and entering password data.

### Description

A history file in ~/.kedpm/history is written in clear text. All of the
commands performed in the password manager are written there. This can
lead to the disclosure of the master password if the “password”
command is used with an argument. The names of the password entries
created and consulted are also accessible in clear text.

### Impact

An attacker could obtain confidential information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo Security recommends that users unmerge Ked Password Manager:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-admin/kedpm"

```
