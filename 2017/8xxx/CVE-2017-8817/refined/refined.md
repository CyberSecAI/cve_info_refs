{
  "CVE-2017-8817": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "libcurl's FTP wildcard matching function does not detect the end of the pattern string if it ends with an open bracket (`[`) and continues reading the heap beyond the end of the URL buffer that holds the wildcard.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious server can redirect clients to a URL using a crafted wildcard pattern, causing a read out of bounds.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious FTP server redirects a client to a URL with a crafted wildcard pattern that ends with `[`. This requires the `CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH` option to be enabled by the application using libcurl.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker controls a malicious server and redirects a client with the vulnerable version of libcurl and the `CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH` option enabled. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim."
