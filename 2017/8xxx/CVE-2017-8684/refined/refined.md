Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8684

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `win32k!NtGdiGetFontResourceInfoInternalW` system call.
- For small, user-specified output buffer sizes (up to 0x5c bytes), the system call uses a stack-based buffer for optimization.
- Unlike pool allocations, this stack memory is not initialized with zeros.
- When the contents of this buffer are copied back to user mode, uninitialized portions of kernel stack memory are disclosed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Memory Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.
- **Lack of Initialization:** The failure to zero-initialize the stack-based buffer before copying it to user-mode is the core weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:**  The vulnerability leaks kernel stack data, potentially including kernel-space addresses and other sensitive information.
- **Bypass of Kernel ASLR:** Repeated exploitation could allow attackers to bypass Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR).
- **Facilitation of Further Exploitation:** Leaked kernel addresses can be used to facilitate the exploitation of other memory corruption vulnerabilities.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can leverage this information to gain higher privileges or access sensitive system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a local, authenticated user triggering the vulnerable `NtGdiGetFontResourceInfoInternalW` system call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is limited to leaking a maximum of 0x5c bytes at a time. Specifying a larger output buffer size triggers a correctly padded pool allocation, preventing the leak.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by calling the `GetFontResourceInfoW` function with a specific font and a small output buffer, resulting in the leakage of kernel stack memory.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Windows 10 by adding a `memset` call to zero-initialize the stack buffer before use. However, the fix was not backported to earlier Windows versions.
