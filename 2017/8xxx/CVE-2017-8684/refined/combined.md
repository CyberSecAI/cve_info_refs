**Vulnerable App:**

```
/*
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1275

We have discovered that the nt!NtGdiGetFontResourceInfoInternalW system call discloses portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.

This is caused by the fact that for user-specified output buffer sizes up to 0x5c, a temporary stack-based buffer is used by the syscall for optimization. As opposed to the pool allocation, the stack memory area is not pre-initialized with zeros, and when it is copied back to user-mode in its entirety, its contents disclose leftover kernel stack bytes containing potentially sensitive information.

The vulnerability is fixed in Windows 10, which has the following memset() call at the beginning of the function:

--- cut ---
.text:0025F9E6                 push    5Ch             ; size_t
.text:0025F9E8                 push    ebx             ; int
.text:0025F9E9                 lea     eax, [ebp+var_118]
.text:0025F9EF                 push    eax             ; void *
.text:0025F9F0                 call    _memset
--- cut ---

This indicates that Microsoft is aware of the bug but didn't backport the fix to systems earlier than Windows 10. The issue was in fact discovered by cross-diffing the list of memset calls between Windows 7 and Windows 10, which illustrates how easy it is to use exclusive patches for one system version to attack another.

The attached proof-of-concept program demonstrates the disclosure. An example output is as follows:

--- cut ---
00000000: 00 00 00 00 a9 fb c2 82 02 00 00 00 19 00 00 00 ................
00000010: 00 00 00 00 46 69 6c 65 a8 6f 06 89 46 69 6c 65 ....File.o..File
00000020: c8 00 00 00 ff 07 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 30 06 89 .............0..
00000030: 00 08 00 00 46 02 00 00 68 72 b8 93 d0 71 b8 93 ....F...hr...q..
00000040: a8 71 b8 93 00 8b 2e 9a 98 a8 a2 82 68 8b 2e 9a .q..........h...
00000050: fa a8 a2 82 a8 71 b8 93 46 69 6c e5 ?? ?? ?? ?? .....q..Fil.....
--- cut ---

Only the first four bytes of the data are properly initialized to 0x00, while the rest are visibly leaked from the kernel stack and contain a multitude of kernel-space addresses, readily facilitating exploitation of other memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The bug is limited to leaking at most ~0x5c bytes at a time, as specifying a larger size will provoke a correctly padded pool allocation instead of the stack-based buffer.

Repeatedly triggering the vulnerability could allow local authenticated attackers to defeat certain exploit mitigations (kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
