{
  "CVE-ID": "CVE-2017-8478",
  "Root cause": "The nt!NtQueryInformationJobObject system call (corresponding to the documented QueryInformationJobObject() API function) called with the 12 information class discloses portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Information Disclosure",
    "Uninitialized memory usage"
  ],
  "Impact": "Repeatedly triggering the vulnerability could allow local authenticated attackers to defeat certain exploit mitigations (kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can trigger the nt!NtQueryInformationJobObject system call with information class 12 and specific output buffer sizes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Local authenticated access is required."
