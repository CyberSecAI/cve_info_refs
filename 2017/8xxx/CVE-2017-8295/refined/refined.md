Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-8295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from WordPress using the `SERVER_NAME` variable to construct the "From" and "Return-Path" email headers in password reset emails. This `SERVER_NAME` variable is derived from the `HTTP_HOST` header provided by the client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unvalidated Input:** WordPress does not validate or sanitize the `HTTP_HOST` header before using it to set the `SERVER_NAME` variable.
- **Header Injection:** By controlling the `HTTP_HOST` header, an attacker can inject arbitrary values into the email headers (specifically, "From", "Return-Path", and "Message-ID").

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Password Reset:**  The attacker can trigger the password reset process for any user by sending a crafted HTTP request.
- **Email Interception:** By controlling the "From" and "Return-Path" headers, the attacker can potentially receive copies of the password reset email. This can occur in several scenarios, such as:
    -   **Email Bouncing:** If the victim's email server is down or has exceeded its quota, the password reset email will bounce back to the attacker's email address specified in the "Return-Path" header.
    -   **Autoresponders:** Some autoresponders might include a copy of the received email in the auto-reply sent back to the "From" address.
    -   **User Interaction:** The attacker can force a user to respond to the malicious email with the reset link, giving access to the attacker.
- **Account Takeover:** By obtaining the password reset link, the attacker can change the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their WordPress account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted `POST` request to the `wp-login.php` page with the `action=lostpassword` parameter and a malicious `Host` header.
- **Target:** Default WordPress installations accessible via IP address (IP-based vhosts) are most vulnerable, where the `HTTP_HOST` header directly dictates the `SERVER_NAME` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress installation.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require any prior authentication to initiate the password reset process.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs the URL of a vulnerable wordpress site.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in WordPress versions up to 4.7.4.
- The advisory mentions that this issue was reported multiple times to the WordPress security team, without a patch, prior to public disclosure.
- A temporary solution is mentioned, which involves enabling `UseCanonicalName` in the web server configuration to enforce a static `SERVER_NAME` value.
- The provided exploit-db content contains a proof-of-concept HTTP request that triggers the password reset function and demonstrates how an attacker can manipulate the email headers.
