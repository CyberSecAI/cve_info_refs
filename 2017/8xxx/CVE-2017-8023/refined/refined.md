```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the use of the 'oldauth' authentication method in the Networker Client execution service (nsrexecd). This method allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to send arbitrary commands via the RPC service.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host system with the privileges of the nsrexecd service, which runs with administrative privileges, potentially compromising the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send arbitrary commands via the RPC service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the affected system."
