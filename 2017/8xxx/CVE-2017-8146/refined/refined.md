The provided content is related to CVE-2017-8146.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of parameter checks within the call module of some Huawei smartphones. Specifically, the vulnerability exists because the call module does not properly validate the parameters sent to it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is the insufficient validation of input parameters in the call module. This allows for the possibility of triggering unintended behavior by sending specially crafted or unexpected input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a denial of service (DoS). The call and data communication process on the affected device can crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking a user into installing a malicious application. This malicious application can then send specially crafted parameters to the vulnerable call module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to convince a user to install a malicious application on their Huawei smartphone. Once installed, the application can send the specific parameters to the call module to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the device outside of what the malicious application is granted.
