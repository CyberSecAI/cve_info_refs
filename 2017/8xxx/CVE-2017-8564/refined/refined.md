Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8564

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an information disclosure vulnerability in the `nsiproxy.sys` driver. The handler for the `0x120007` IOCTL, which is accessed via the undocumented `NSI!NsiGetParameter` function, returns portions of uninitialized pool memory to user-mode clients. This occurs because of output structure alignment holes where the kernel copies back more data than initialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of uninitialized kernel pool memory. This memory may contain sensitive data or remnants of previous operations.
- **Improper Output Handling:** The driver doesn't properly initialize all bytes of the output buffer before copying it to user-mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) Bypass:** By repeatedly triggering the vulnerability, an attacker could leak kernel addresses, which could be used to bypass KASLR.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Kernel Data:** The uninitialized memory could contain secrets, pointers, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local, authenticated user.
- **IOCTL Call:** The attack vector involves sending a specific IOCTL (0x120007) to the `nsiproxy.sys` driver through the `NSI!NsiGetParameter` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user.
- **Ability to Make IOCTL Calls:** The attacker must have the ability to make calls to kernel drivers.
