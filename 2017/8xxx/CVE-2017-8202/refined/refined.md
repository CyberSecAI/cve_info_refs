- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CameraISP driver of some Huawei smart phones has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the CameraISP driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a system reboot.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious app. The malicious app sends a specific parameter to the vulnerable driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious application and trick a user into installing it.
