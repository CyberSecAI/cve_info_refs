Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-8086:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in the `v9fs_list_xattr` function of the QEMU's 9pfs (Plan 9 File System) implementation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak issue. Specifically, the `orig_value` is not freed in the error path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A privileged user or process within the guest virtual machine can exploit this flaw to leak host memory.
- This memory leak can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the host.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a guest operating system user/process when querying extended file attributes via the `v9fs_list_xattr()` routine.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the 9pfs filesystem from within the guest.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a privileged account within the guest VM.
- The attacker must be able to access and interact with the 9pfs filesystem to trigger the `v9fs_list_xattr` function.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `hw/9pfs/9p-xattr.c`
- The fix involves adding `g_free(orig_value);` to the error handling path within `v9fs_list_xattr`.
- The bug was reported by Li Qiang of Qihoo 360 Gear Team.
