{
  "CVE-ID": "CVE-2017-8489",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The handler of the 0x224000 IOCTL (WmiQueryAllData functionality) implemented by the \\.\\WMIDataDevice device in ntoskrnl.exe discloses portions of uninitialized pool memory to user-mode clients.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory disclosure due to returning uninitialized pool memory to user mode."
    ],
    "impact": "Local authenticated attackers can use this vulnerability to defeat certain exploit mitigations (kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "vector": "A local authenticated attacker can send the 0x224000 IOCTL to the \\.\\WMIDataDevice device, triggering the vulnerability.",
      "capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated locally."
    }
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "ntoskrnl.exe",
    "\\.\\WMIDataDevice"
  ],
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered through the WMI interface (WmiOpenBlock, WmiQueryAllDataW, WmiCloseBlock).  The PoC provided uses high-level functions in advapi32.dll instead of directly sending IOCTLs."
