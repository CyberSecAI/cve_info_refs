Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8116

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from **ineffective sanitization of user input** within the web-based management interface (LuCI) of Teltonika routers. Specifically, user-provided input from the login page is passed to the `/usr/bin/logger` command via the `sys.exec()` function without proper filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the system shell. This is due to the lack of proper input sanitization when processing the username field during login attempts.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the router's web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router with root privileges.
- **Complete System Compromise:** This can lead to full control of the device, allowing attackers to:
    - Add/modify user accounts.
    - Monitor network traffic.
    - Modify firewall rules (iptables).
    - Install backdoors or malware.
    - Potentially pivot into other devices or networks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface (LuCI):** The attack vector is the web-based management interface accessible over HTTP (or HTTPS if configured).
- **Login Page:** The vulnerability is triggered through the login page by injecting malicious commands into the username field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web interface of the vulnerable router. This could be via the local network or if the router is directly exposed to the internet.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid login credentials, making it easier to exploit.
- **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the router's web interface.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Teltonika RUT9XX firmware versions <= 00.03.265
- Affected models include Teltonika RUT900, RUT905, RUT950, and RUT955.
- The vulnerability exists in the LUA code that processes login requests, specifically in the `dispatcher.lua` file, by directly passing the username to the `sys.exec()` function, which executes it in the system shell via `/usr/bin/logger`.
- While some sanitization was introduced in later firmware versions (e.g., filtering of tick characters), it was not sufficient to prevent the exploit. Redirection characters like `>` and `>>` were still accepted and could be used to achieve command injection.
-  The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/luci` endpoint with the malicious command embedded in the `username` field, and an arbitrary value for the password. The command is executed via /usr/bin/logger.
- The vulnerability can be used to add a new user with root access by modifying the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files, as shown by the Metasploit module `teltonika_add_user.rb`.

**Mitigation:**
- Update the router's firmware to a patched version provided by the vendor.

**Metasploit Modules:**
- Two Metasploit modules have been developed to exploit this vulnerability:
    - `teltonika_cmd_exec.rb` for arbitrary command execution.
    - `teltonika_add_user.rb` to add a new user with root privileges.

This detailed breakdown provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited.
