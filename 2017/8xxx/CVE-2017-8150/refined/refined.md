- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The boot loaders of some Huawei mobile phones have an arbitrary memory write vulnerability due to the lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary memory write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to continuous system reboots or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application, installed by a user tricked by the attacker, can modify specific data to cause arbitrary memory writing during the next system reboot.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have root privileges on the Android system and must trick the user into installing a malicious application.
