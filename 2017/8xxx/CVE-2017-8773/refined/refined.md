Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:** Improper validation of `dwCompressionSize` within the Microsoft WIM header (`WIMHEADER_V1_PACKED`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds write on a heap buffer. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from how the software handles the `dwCompressionSize` field in a Microsoft WIM header, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Privilege Escalation. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system and gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a maliciously crafted Microsoft WIM file, with a manipulated `dwCompressionSize` field, which likely happens during the normal scanning operations of the affected security software. The attacker would likely have to deliver this malicious WIM file to the target system, which could be done via network or local storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious WIM file to the system running the vulnerable Quick Heal software. No additional privileges appear to be needed to trigger the vulnerability.
