<!--
There is a type confusion issue related to how some arithmetic operations are performed in VBScript.

To illustrate, see the following simplified code of VbsVarMod

static unsigned char result_lookup_table[18][18] = {...}

void VbsVarMod(VAR *v1, VAR *v2) {
  VAR *arith_v1 = v1->PvarGetArithVal();
  VAR *arith_v2 = v2->PvarGetArithVal();
  int result_type = result_lookup_table[v1->vartype][v2->vartype];

  if(result_type == 10) {
    RaiseError(...);
  }

  if(result_type == 2) {
    ...
  } else if(result_type == 3) {
    ...
  } else if(result_type == 4) {
    ...
  }
  v1->vartype = result_type;
}

where the logic for VAR::PvarGetArithVal is roughly

VAR *VAR::PvarGetArithVal() {
  VAR *result = this->PvarGetVarVal()
  if(result->vartype > 17) RaiseError(...);
}

The VbsVarMod function (as well as many other arithmetic functions) first gets the arithmetic values of input variables and then uses the lookup table to determine the result type. PvarGetArithVal tries to ensure that the vartypes of input will be <18 so the lookup table won't be accessed out-of-bounds.

The problem is that the call to v2->PvarGetArithVal() can run arbitrary script which can change the type of arith_v1. If we change v1 to an array (which typically has vartype of 8192), suddenly there will be an out-of-bound access when looking up the result type and the result type can become unexpected. In case of VbsVarMod() if the result type is not 10(Error),2(Integer),3(Long) or 4(single), the function will simply assign the result type to the result variable (v1), while the actual data will remain unchanged. This causes a type confusion in v1.

Which result type an attacker can select depends on the build of vbscript.dll. On 64-bit Windows 10 in IE Version 11.1066.14393.0 (Update version 11.0.41) I managed to set the result type to 5 (Double) which causes a heap pointer leak (see the attached screenshots) as the pointer inside v1 will be treated as a double value.

However, if an attacker was lucky and managed to select as result_type something that contains a pointer (Such as a String or an Object) this could result in a type confusion with a more serious impact (a larger info leak in case of a String and possibly RCE in case of an Object).

There might also be a possibilty to use invalid return type values >=18 as a trampoline, i.e. feed them back into VbsVarMod to reach more useful types, but I haven't tried this.

This issue is not limited to VbsVarMod and affects other arithmetic functions that call PvarGetArithVal and use a result lookup table as well (specifically: VbsVarAdd, VbsVarSub, VbsVarMul, VbsVarDiv, VbsVarIDiv, VbsVarPow) to a varying degree of exploitability (depending on how aggressive checks on the result type they make). One way to fix this in the affected functions is to do a check for vartype<18 only after both variables have been read.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
