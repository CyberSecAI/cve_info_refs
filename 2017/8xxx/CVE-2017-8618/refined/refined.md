{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A type confusion vulnerability exists in VBScript arithmetic operations due to improper handling of variable types during arithmetic calculations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion vulnerability due to the way arithmetic operations are performed in VBScript.",
       "Out-of-bounds access in the result lookup table due to a variable type change during the execution of the PvarGetArithVal function."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a heap pointer leak and potentially more serious consequences, such as arbitrary code execution, depending on the selected result type and its associated pointer.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a VBScript that manipulates the variable types in a way that leads to out-of-bounds access during type calculation and arithmetic operations.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious VBScript within a vulnerable environment, such as a website rendered in a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate the variable types to cause the vulnerability."

    "poc": "A proof-of-concept is provided, showing how manipulating an object's default property can change the variable type, leading to the vulnerability.",
    "affected_versions": "The provided information indicates that Internet Explorer version 11.1066.14393.0 is vulnerable, specifically mentioning 64-bit Windows 10."
