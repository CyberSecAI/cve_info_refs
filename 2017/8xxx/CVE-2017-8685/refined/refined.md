{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `NtGdiEngCreatePalette` system call in Windows kernel uses a stack-based buffer for palettes with up to 256 colors, when created in `PAL_INDEXED` mode. This buffer is not initialized with zeros, leading to disclosure of uninitialized stack memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of uninitialized stack memory",
       "Lack of proper input validation when pulColors is NULL"
    ],
    "impact": "Disclosure of kernel stack memory, potentially revealing sensitive data such as kernel addresses, which can be used to defeat exploit mitigations like KASLR. Repeated exploitation could lead to reading other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local attacker with ability to execute code on the vulnerable system can trigger the `NtGdiEngCreatePalette` syscall with specific parameters to leak stack memory.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local authenticated access to the system with ability to call the `NtGdiEngCreatePalette` system call."
