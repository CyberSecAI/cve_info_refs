Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of a `org.springframework.amqp.core.Message` object when it is converted into a string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is that the `Message` object, when processed as a string, is subject to deserialization vulnerabilities. This means that if a crafted malicious payload is embedded within the message, it can be deserialized, leading to unintended consequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable Spring AMQP application. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Payload:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious payload that, when deserialized, will execute arbitrary code.
- **Message Injection:** The attacker would need to inject this malicious payload into a `org.springframework.amqp.core.Message` which will be processed as a string by the vulnerable application. The method of injection isn't explicitly stated, but it is implied that an attacker will need to manipulate the message before it reaches the vulnerable Spring AMQP component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Send Malicious Message:** The attacker must be able to send or inject a specially crafted AMQP message to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** The attacker requires knowledge of how to construct a malicious payload that exploits the deserialization process.
