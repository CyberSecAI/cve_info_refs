- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the driver of some Huawei smartphones due to the lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to reboot the system or execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application with root privileges on the Android system sends a specific parameter to the phone's driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application, and this application must have root privileges on the Android system.
