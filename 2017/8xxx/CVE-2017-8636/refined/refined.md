{
  "CVE-2017-8636": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Integer overflow in `EmitNew` function when constructing a new object with a large number of arguments (0xFFFF), leading to an out-of-bounds write in `InterpreterStackFrame::SetOut` and a potential stack or heap buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses": [

        "Heap overflow",
        "NULL pointer dereference due to an integer overflow in argument parsing"
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service due to crash, potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted JavaScript code executed in Microsoft Edge's Chakra engine.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of Microsoft Edge. No special privileges or system access needed, just interaction with the vulnerable browser."
