Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8061:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided text discusses a bypass of `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM`, which is a security-related kernel configuration option designed to prevent userland processes from directly modifying kernel memory. This aligns with the potential security implications mentioned in the subject line of the email: "Silently (or obliviously) partially-fixed CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM bypass" .

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of factors:
   -   The Linux kernel, even with `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` enabled, allows slab allocations in allowed regions below 1MB.
   -   `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` explicitly allowed both reads and writes to these allocations which are meant to be protected.
   - A specific kernel commit fixed the write side of the issue, but neglected the mmap side and did not mention the bypass in the commit message.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Protection:** `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` is intended to prevent userland from modifying kernel memory directly. However, it is not fully protecting lower memory regions, and allows userland to read and write to slab allocations.
- **Mismatched Protection:** While a commit fixed the write-side of this issue, it failed to fix the mmap side, thus not fully protecting memory regions and allowing for bypass of the intended protection by other means.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Kernel Memory Corruption:** Attackers could potentially modify kernel data structures by exploiting the ability to write to these low memory allocations. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    -   Denial of service
    -   Privilege escalation
    -   System instability
    -  Security Boot bypass (as stated in the email)

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is exploited by mapping a memory region using mmap, which allows user-mode code to have direct access to the low memory region.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system, i.e. the attacker must be able to execute code on the target machine.
-   **User Privileges:** The attacker requires a user with the capability to use `mmap` to access the low memory regions, which may require CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

**Summary of Relevant Content:**
The email from Brad Spengler highlights an incomplete fix for a vulnerability related to `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` bypass which explicitly was not possible in grsecurity.
This config is intended to protect userland from directly modifying kernel memory, but due to kernel slab allocations, certain regions of memory below 1MB could be modified by userland processes through the use of `mmap`, which the commit mentioned in the mail does not fix.
