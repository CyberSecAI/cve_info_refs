- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An incorrect configuration item resulted in the information transmitted by a channel not being encrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information leak due to lack of encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information transmitted over the network.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have access to the internal network of the Huawei FusionSphere Openstack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned to access the internal network where the vulnerable system is located.
