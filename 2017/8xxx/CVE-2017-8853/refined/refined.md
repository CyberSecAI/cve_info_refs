The provided content is related to CVE-2017-8853.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in Fiyo CMS version 2.0.7 due to the lack of proper input validation for `$_POST['act']` and `$_POST['file']` parameters in the `backuper.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file deletion: The application allows an attacker to delete any file on the server that the web server process has permissions to access.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize or validate user input before using it in a file system operation.
- Direct access to file system: The `backuper.php` file directly interacts with the file system based on user provided input.
- Lack of authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to log in to the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Deletion: An attacker can delete any file on the server, leading to denial of service or data loss.
- System compromise: Deletion of important system files might lead to the system malfunction and further compromises.
- Data loss: Deletion of application's data might lead to data loss and disrupt the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `backuper.php` file.
- Crafted input: The attacker crafts the `act` and `file` parameters in the POST request to delete the target file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable file: The attacker needs to know that the `backuper.php` file is vulnerable.
- No authentication needed: The attacker does not need to be logged into the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs in `dapur/apps/app_config/controller/backuper.php`. The attacker can send a POST request to this file.

POST: `type=delete&act=db&file=../.htaccess`

The attacker sets `act=db` and `file=../.htaccess`, which will delete the `.htaccess` file.
