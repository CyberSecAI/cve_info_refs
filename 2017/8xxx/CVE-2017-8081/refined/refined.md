- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `generate_salt` function uses `mt_rand` which is considered a weak random number generator and truncates the SHA1 hash to 22 characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Use of `mt_rand` for generating the salt.
    - Unnecessary truncation of the SHA1 hash to 22 characters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A weak salt can make password hashes more susceptible to cracking, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit the weak salt generation to compromise password security by using pre-computed rainbow tables or other brute-force techniques to crack password hashes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to obtain the password hashes of users of the GetSimpleCMS.
