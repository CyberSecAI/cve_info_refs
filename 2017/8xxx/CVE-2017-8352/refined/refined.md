Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `ReadXWDImage` function in `xwd.c` of ImageMagick. Specifically, a memory leak occurs due to improper memory management in this function when processing a crafted XWD file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. The `ReadXWDImage` function allocates memory but fails to release it, leading to a gradual consumption of system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Repeated exploitation of this memory leak can lead to a denial of service by exhausting system memory. This makes the affected system unresponsive or unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted File: The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted XWD image file to the vulnerable `ReadXWDImage` function. This can be achieved through various means, such as uploading the malicious file to a service that uses ImageMagick or by processing the image via a command-line tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Provide Input: An attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted XWD file to the vulnerable system. This could be as simple as submitting a file for processing or tricking a user into opening such a file with an affected application.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was reported by the ADLab of Venustech.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Debian by updating the `imagemagick` package to version `8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u9` for stable distributions and `8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-8` for both the upcoming stable and unstable distributions.
