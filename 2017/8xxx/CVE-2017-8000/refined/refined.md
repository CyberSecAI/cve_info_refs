Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8000:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- A malicious RSA Security Console Administrator can inject a crafted script into a token profile name.
- This crafted script is stored in the RSA Authentication Manager database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient input sanitization when saving token profile names in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When another administrator views or edits the affected token profile, the stored script is executed within their browser session.
- This could lead to the compromise of the affected system and potentially other malicious actions within the administrator's session.
- The specific impact of the XSS will depend on the injected script (e.g., session hijacking, unauthorized actions, defacement, etc.)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the RSA Authentication Manager's administrative interface.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered through manipulating the token profile name field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a malicious RSA Security Console Administrator.
- They need the privileges to create or modify token profiles.
- No user interaction is required beyond the vulnerable administrators access to the UI, after the malicious profile has been created.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects RSA Authentication Manager 8.2 SP1 and earlier.
- The fix is available in RSA Authentication Manager 8.2 SP1 Patch 1 and later.
- The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 4.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N) indicating a medium severity rating.
