Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-8851:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
    *   **Lenient `updater-script`:** The OTA update scripts (`updater-script`) on OnePlus One and OnePlus X devices use insufficient checks to verify the target device. Specifically, they only check for `ro.build.product` to be "OnePlus" (OnePlus X) or "OnePlus" or "ONE" (OnePlus One).
    *   **Shared OTA Verification Keys:** Both OnePlus One and OnePlus X devices use the same keys to verify OTA updates.
    *   **Shared `ro.build.product`:** Both devices share the system property `ro.build.product` which is used to check for the correct device in the update script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Device Verification:** The `updater-script` does not perform a strict check to distinguish between the OnePlus One and OnePlus X, allowing OTAs intended for one device to be installed on the other.
*   **Lack of Proper Update Integrity Checks:** The script checks are weak and do not prevent cross-device installation if a device has the required product name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Device OTA Installation:** Attackers can install an OTA meant for a different device (e.g., OnePlus X OTA on a OnePlus One or vice-versa).
*   **Exploitation of Unpatched Vulnerabilities:** This could enable attackers to exploit vulnerabilities present in the target device's software which have been patched in the other device, expanding attack surface.
*   **Device Unusability:** Incorrect OTA installations could render the device unusable until a factory reset is performed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) Attack:** A MiTM attacker can intercept and replace a legitimate OTA update with an incorrect one due to the lack of TLS protection during the update process (related to [CVE-2016-10370](/vulns/aleph-2017022)).
*   **Physical Access Attack:** An attacker with physical access can use `adb sideload` to push the incorrect OTA after booting the phone into recovery mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MiTM:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic during an OTA update process.
*   **Physical Access:** An attacker needs physical access to the device to use `adb sideload`.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided `updater-script` snippets show how the insufficient checks are implemented on each device.
* A proof of concept (PoC) is available on GitHub.
