Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the elFinder component integrated within Exponent CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- XSS vulnerability exists within elFinder, a file manager component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the web application through the vulnerable elFinder file manager. This could lead to various impacts including:
    - Execution of malicious code in the victim's browser
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the elFinder component, likely by manipulating file names or other input parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the elFinder interface in Exponent CMS, which could be through a user account or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that could lead to access to the file manager.
-  The attacker needs to inject malicious javascript into the elFinder component.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves a code change in `framework/modules/file/connector/elfinder.php` where a line related to `elFinderConnector` is modified. The removal of the `true` parameter from the `elFinderConnector` constructor appears to be the solution. The specific reason for the vulnerability fix isn't explicitly detailed but it seems that the issue lies with how elFinderConnector was configured.
- This vulnerability was addressed in patch #5 for Exponent CMS version 2.4.1, highlighting the importance of keeping the CMS and its components up to date.
- The patch also includes several other bug fixes and improvements, including a change in default password security (blowfish vs md5), suggesting that security was a focus in this release.
