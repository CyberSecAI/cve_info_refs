- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of received PKI certificates during TLS and DTLS handshakes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Input validation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows attackers to crash the TLS module, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can send abnormal TLS and DTLS certificates to the device to trigger the crash.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the device network.
