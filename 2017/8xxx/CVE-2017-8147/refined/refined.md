- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper implementation of the OSPF protocol, specifically how the device handles Link State Advertisement (LSA) packets. When a device receives specific LSA packets, the Link State (LS) age is incorrectly set to MaxAge (3600 seconds).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the incorrect setting of the LS age to MaxAge (3600 seconds) upon receiving special LSA packets. This can be triggered by a malicious actor by crafting specific LSA packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to poison the route table, potentially disrupting network traffic. This could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by manipulating the routing information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted LSA packets to a vulnerable device within the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the victim's network to send malicious LSA packets. No specific authentication or privileges are needed other than network accessibility.
