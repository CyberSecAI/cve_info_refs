Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8311:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap corruption vulnerability exists in the `libsubtitle_plugin.dll` when parsing JacoSUB subtitles in VLC, Kodi, and PopcornTime. This is due to a flaw in how the software processes specifically crafted subtitle files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap corruption: The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite data on the heap, leading to memory corruption.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered in the JacoSUB subtitle parsing functionality of the affected applications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates a crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: The exploit-db entry mentions that the crash is exploitable, suggesting a possibility of achieving arbitrary code execution. However, it also notes this is difficult due to environmental constraints like threading, mitigations and scriptless environment.
- Arbitrary code execution could lead to full control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious subtitle files: The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious subtitle file (specifically a .jss file in the provided PoC) that, when parsed by the vulnerable application, triggers the heap corruption.
- The user must open/load the specially crafted subtitle file using a vulnerable version of VLC, Kodi or PopcornTime

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed subtitle file.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to open this malicious subtitle file using a vulnerable application.
- No specific position on the network is mentioned, indicating the attacker can be remote.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `libsubtitle_plugin.dll`
- The exploit-db entry provides a Python PoC script to generate a malicious .jss file.
- The vulnerability is present in VLC Media Player, Kodi, and PopcornTime, all using a shared component.
- Gentoo and Debian both issued security advisories related to this CVE, indicating it is a serious issue that affects multiple platforms and distributions.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3899-1) mentions that processing malformed subtitle or movie files can lead to DoS or arbitrary code execution.
- The affected versions are prior to 2.2.6
