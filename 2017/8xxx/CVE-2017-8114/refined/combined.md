# Security updates 1.2.5, 1.1.9 and 1.0.11 released

Published: 28 April 2017

* Tags:
* [releases](/news/releases)
* [updates](/news/updates)
* [security](/news/security)

We just published updates to all stable versions 1.x delivering important bug fixes
and improvements which we picked from the upstream branch.

The updates primarily fix a recently discovered vulnerability in the virtualmin and sasl
drivers of the password plugin (CVE-2017-8114). Security-wise the update is therefore
only relevant for those installations of Roundcube using the password plugin with either
one of these drivers.

See the full changelog for the according version in the release notes on the Github
download pages:
[v1.2.5](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.2.5),
[v1.1.9](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.1.9),
[v1.0.11](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.0.11)

All versions are considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations
of Roundcube with either of these versions.

As usual, don’t forget to backup your data before updating!

The only difference is that -mm1 works, so it seems that -mm1 has some useful patches that -gentoo-r3 wants ;-) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Paolo Ornati    2004-08-28 03:29:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 38375](attachment.cgi?id=38375 "differences between Gentoo's drivers/acpi/scan.c and \"-mm\" one") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=38375&action=edit "differences between Gentoo's drivers/acpi/scan.c and \"-mm\" one"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=38375&action=diff "differences between Gentoo's drivers/acpi/scan.c and \"-mm\" one")] differences between Gentoo's drivers/acpi/scan.c and "-mm" one ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Paolo Ornati    2004-08-28 03:29:58 UTC  ``` I have found where the problem comes from...

# Roundcube Webmail Virtualmin Privilege Escalation (CVE-2017-8114)

* *Software*: <https://roundcube.net/>
* *Version*: 1.3-beta, and probably previous versions
* *CVE*: CVE-2017-8114
* *Author*: Martino Sani
* *Release date*: 2017-04-28

## Executive Summary

Roundcube Webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an application-like user interface. Roundcube version 1.3-beta and probably previous versions do not properly sanitize client's inputs. This can lead to an arbitrary password resets by authenticated users.

Roundcube uses multiple plugins that extend its functionalities. They are not part of the core application but can be installed individually. Roundcube comes with a number of plugins, and more third-party plugins are available for download.

Official *password* plugin in its *virtualmin* driver allows to an attacker, that has a valid username/password to login in his web panel, to execute malicious inputs. This could allow to an attacker to reset victim's password and in some scenarios getting a system shell.

## Technical Details

`save()` method in `virtualmin.php` uses an `exec()` function without properly filter user-supplied inputs:

```
class rcube_virtualmin_password {

   function save($currpass, $newpass) {

      ...

      $username = escapeshellcmd($username);
      $domain   = escapeshellcmd($domain);
      $newpass  = escapeshellcmd($newpass);
      $curdir   = RCUBE_PLUGINS_DIR . 'password/helpers';

      exec("$curdir/chgvirtualminpasswd modify-user --domain $domain --user $username --pass $newpass", $output, $returnvalue);

      ...

   }

}
```

`escapeshellcmd()` escapes any characters in a string that might be used to trick a shell command into executing arbitrary commands. This function should be used to make sure that any data coming from user input is escaped before this data is passed to the `exec()` or `system()` functions, or to the backtick operator.

`escapeshellarg()` adds single quotes around a string and quotes/escapes any existing single quotes allowing you to pass a string directly to a shell function and having it be treated as a single safe argument. This function should be used to escape individual arguments to shell functions coming from user input. The shell functions include `exec()`, `system()` and the backtick operator.

Thanks to `escapeshellcmd()` an attacker can not execute arbitrary commands, but can use arbitrary `modify-user` parameters.

`chgvirtualminpasswd` is a simple wrapper to [virtualmin](https://www.virtualmin.com/) that must run as root, which makes this injection more interesting. For the list of `modify-user` parameters see [virtualmin-doc](https://www.virtualmin.com/documentation/developer/cli/modify_user).

As example, a malicious user can inject a custom string as `$newpass` resetting the password of an arbitrary user.
Attacker, authenticated as `mark`, can insert the following string as new password:

```
foo --user john --pass hacked

```

`exec()` will execute following command:

```
chgvirtualminpasswd modify-user --domain localhost --user mark --pass foo --user john --pass hacked

```

In the above command the last `--user` and `--pass` parameters will be evaluated by `chgvirtualminpasswd` and the victim’s (`john`) password will be changed.

If ssh service is open and reachable the attacker can login using the victim's credentials. Or, if ssh service is reachable but users can't login via an interactive shell (e.g. has `/bin/nologin` or `/dev/null` shell), the attacker can change his shell (e.g to `/bin/bash`) injecting the following string as `$newpass`:

```
pass --shell /bin/bash

```

Vendor promptly fixes the issue and a similar bug in `sasl` driver. See [Roundcube Project News](https://roundcube.net/news/2017/04/28/security-updates-1.2.5-1.1.9-and-1.0.11).

# RoundCube: Security bypass — GLSA **201707-11**

A vulnerability in RoundCube may allow authenticated users to
bypass security restrictions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/roundcube** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.5** |

### Background

Free and open source webmail software for the masses, written in PHP.

### Description

Authenticated users can arbitrarily reset passwords due to a problem
caused by an improperly restricted exec call in the virtualmin and sasl
drivers of the password plugin.

### Impact

Authenticated users can bypass security restrictions and elevate
privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All RoundCube users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/roundcube-1.2.5"

```
