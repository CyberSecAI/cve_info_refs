  "CVE-2017-8366": {
    "description": "The ettercap network security tool for traffic interception contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application crash by providing maliciously crafted filters.",
    "root_cause": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the `strescape` function within `ec_strings.c`, triggered during the parsing of a malformed filter. The `strescape` function did not correctly handle the escaped string length, leading to a buffer overflow when writing to the destination buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash)",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted filters"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to provide a maliciously crafted filter to the `etterfilter` utility.",
    "additional_details": [
       "The vulnerability is located in the `strescape` function in `src/ec_strings.c`.",
      "The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of a malformed filter.",
      "The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).",
        "The fix involves adding a size check inside the while loop in the strescape function in src/ec_strings.c"
