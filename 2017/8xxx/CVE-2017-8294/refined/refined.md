Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8294:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `yr_re_exec()` function within the YARA library. The issue stems from incorrect handling of word boundary (`\b`, `\B`) regular expression operators when scanning wide strings (where each character is represented by two bytes).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to read memory outside the bounds of the provided input buffer when processing a wide string with word boundary operators.
- **Improper handling of wide strings:** The logic for determining word boundaries in wide strings was flawed, leading to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Segmentation Fault:** The out-of-bounds read causes a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the YARA application. This could result in denial of service or prevent its correct operation.
- **Potential for information disclosure:** While the provided information indicates a crash due to the read outside buffer boundaries, in some cases, out-of-bounds reads could potentially leak sensitive information from memory, if the out-of-bounds read is not directly resulting in crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted YARA rule:** An attacker can create a YARA rule with a regular expression containing word boundary operators (`\b`, `\B`) applied to a wide string.
- **Scanning of malicious data:** When YARA is used to scan data containing such regular expression operators on specially crafted wide strings, the vulnerability is triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a YARA rule that contains a regular expression using `\b` or `\B` and wide strings.
- The attacker must be able to trigger YARA to scan data where the vulnerable regular expression will be executed.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue is located in `libyara/re.c` at line 2037 in the `yr_re_exec` function, where the code attempts to access memory outside the allocated region during the evaluation of `\b` and `\B` in a wide string.
- The fix for the issue involved changing the `IS_WORD_CHAR` macro with a new function `_yr_re_is_word_char` which takes into account character size and also correcting the logic for handling word boundaries in `yr_re_exec` to properly consider character sizes.
- The commit `83d799804648c2a0895d40a19835d9b757c6fa4e` addresses this vulnerability by correcting the flawed logic.
