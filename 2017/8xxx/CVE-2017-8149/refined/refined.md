- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of parameter validation in the boot loaders of some Huawei mobile phones leads to an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds memory access, specifically a buffer overflow, due to insufficient parameter validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to out-of-bounds memory read, which results in a continuous system reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application with root privileges on the Android system is required to modify specific data that triggers the vulnerability upon system reboot.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs root privileges on the Android system and must trick a user into installing a malicious application.
