**CVE-2017-8072 is UNRELATED**

The provided content primarily discusses various bug fixes and improvements in the Linux kernel, none of which relate to a specific vulnerability identified as CVE-2017-8072.  The content includes:

*   **Driver fixes**: Multiple fixes in different drivers (e.g., i915, iwlwifi, USB serial, HID, etc.) addressing issues like hangs, incorrect behavior, and data corruption.
*   **Core kernel fixes**: Patches for memory management, interrupt handling, power management, and other core functionalities.
*   **Security-related fixes**:  A few commits address potential security issues, such as preventing access violations and NULL pointer dereferences, but these are not related to CVE-2017-8072.

The most relevant piece of information is from openwall.com, which discusses a **CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM** bypass being "partially fixed" by commit `a4866aa812518ed1a37d8ea0c881dc946409de94`. However, this is not related to CVE-2017-8072.

**Summary of the CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM Bypass (not CVE-2017-8072)**

*   **Root Cause**: The kernel was making slab allocations in regions below 1MB, which are supposed to be protected by `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM`. This setting aims to prevent userland from directly modifying kernel memory. The kernel was allowing both read and write access to these allocations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:  A bypass of the intended `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` protection, allowing userland to potentially read and write to certain kernel memory regions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:  Theoretically, userland could modify kernel data structures, potentially leading to privilege escalation, denial of service or other malicious behavior.  However, the vulnerability was only partially fixed by the commit listed and the mmap read side of the vulnerability was not addressed by this patch.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Userland programs that attempted to access kernel memory below 1MB
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker with the ability to execute code in userland would need to find a way to reliably target and manipulate these specific memory allocations to achieve a full privilege escalation.
