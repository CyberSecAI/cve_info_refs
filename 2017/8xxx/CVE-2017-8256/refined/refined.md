  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm Wi-Fi driver when handling certain network traffic.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit of the vulnerability could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the processing of maliciously crafted network traffic.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker with the ability to send specifically crafted network packets to the vulnerable device's Wi-Fi interface could exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would likely need to be within Wi-Fi range of the device."
