Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8645

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect re-parsing process in the Chakra JavaScript engine of Microsoft Edge. When an asm.js module fails to link, Chakra attempts to re-parse the function as a normal JavaScript function. However, it incorrectly handles class declarations during this re-parse. Instead of starting from the constructor, it starts from the beginning of the class declaration, leading to misattribution of information to the constructor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect parsing logic when re-parsing asm.js module failures, specifically within class declarations.
- Improper handling of the constructor during re-parse, resulting in the binding of information from other class members to the constructor.
- Assertion failure in debug builds due to incorrect function starting point.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided information indicates that the vulnerability can cause a crash or assertion failure within the debug builds of the Chakra engine, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted JavaScript code with an asm.js module that fails to link, forcing the vulnerable re-parse path.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by embedding the exploit code within a webpage that is rendered by Microsoft Edge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious JavaScript code to a user of Microsoft Edge. This could be achieved through malicious websites or other methods where the browser renders the code.

**Technical Details:**
- Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how `ByteCodeGenerator::StartBindFunction` handles the case when a failed asm.js function is re-parsed as a normal javascript function. When a class is declared, the re-parse starts at the class declaration rather than the constructor, leading to an incorrect parsing context. The assertion failure happens when `this->pCurrentFunction` (which should be the constructor) is compared with `pnode` (which incorrectly refers to the method "f").
- The proof-of-concept (PoC) provided in the exploit demonstrates how the `f` method's information is incorrectly bound to the constructor when the asm.js module within the constructor fails to link, triggering the vulnerability.
