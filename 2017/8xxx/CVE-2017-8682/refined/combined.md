**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1273

We have encountered a number of Windows kernel crashes in the win32k.sys driver while processing corrupted TTF font files. The most frequent one occurring for the bug reported here is as follows:

---
  PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)
  Invalid system memory was referenced.  This cannot be protected by try-except,
  it must be protected by a Probe.  Typically the address is just plain bad or it
  is pointing at freed memory.
  Arguments:
  Arg1: 8273777f, memory referenced.
  Arg2: 00000000, value 0 = read operation, 1 = write operation.
  Arg3: 919c279f, If non-zero, the instruction address which referenced the bad memory
    address.
  Arg4: 00000000, (reserved)

We have observed the invalid memory addresses accessed by the win32k!bGeneratePath function to be seemingly "wild", e.g. 0x8273777f, 0xe9849de5, 0xc7617bc7, 0xf2edc7eb etc. The above crash dump comes from an old version of Windows 7 32-bit, because symbols for win32k.sys on the latest build are currently unavailable on the Microsoft Symbol Server. Nevertheless, a crash summary from an up-to-date system is as follows:

--- cut ---
  PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)

While the above crashes are the most common ones, we have also encountered bugchecks (likely caused by the same issue) at the following other locations on old Windows 7 32-bit:

---
  win32k!vQsplineToPolyBezier+43
  91522614 8b4608          mov     eax,dword ptr [esi+8]
---
  win32k!vQsplineToPolyBezier+83
  92292654 8941fc          mov     dword ptr [ecx-4],eax
---

... and on latest Windows 7 32-bit:

---
  win32k!EngDeleteRgn+3293
  91e0747c 8b460c          mov     eax,dword ptr [esi+0Ch]
---

The crash in win32k!vQsplineToPolyBezier+83 strongly suggests that the failures are caused or may lead to memory corruption, and consequently to arbitrary code execution.

While we have not determined the specific root cause of the vulnerability, we have pinpointed the offending mutations to reside in the "fpgm" table. In case of the few samples we have examined, the problem seems to stem from changing one of the instructions in the FPGM program to "FLIPPT".

The issue reproduces on Windows 7 (other platforms unchecked). It is easiest to reproduce with Special Pools enabled for win32k.sys (leading to an immediate crash when the bug is triggered), but it it also possible to observe a system crash on a default Windows installation. In order to reproduce the problem with the provided samples, it is necessary to use a custom program which calls the GetGlyphOutline() API with various parameters over all of the font's glyphs.

Attached is an archive with several proof-of-concept mutated TTF files.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
