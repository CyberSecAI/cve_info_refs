{
  "Root cause": "Incorrect usage of the `PushPopFrameHelper` class in `InterpreterStackFrame::ProcessLinkFailedAsmJsModule`. The `PushPopFrameHelper` is designed to push a stack frame in its constructor and pop it in the destructor when used as a stack object. However, it's incorrectly used as a function call, causing the stack frame to be pushed and immediately popped instead of being held for the duration of the function execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Incorrect usage of a helper class (`PushPopFrameHelper`) leading to an invalid stack frame object."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). The invalid stack frame object causes a crash when `BailOutRecord::ScheduleLoopBodyCodeGen` attempts to access `interpreterFrame->GetCurrentLoopNum()`, because `interpreterFrame` is invalid.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the JavaScript code uses an asm.js module that causes a bailout during JIT compilation. The provided PoC demonstrates this scenario.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute crafted JavaScript code in a vulnerable environment (e.g., a web page viewed in Microsoft Edge). The specific structure of the asm.js module in the PoC is needed to trigger the vulnerability."
