  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-8083",
    "description": "CompuLab Intense PC and MintBox 2 fail to properly write protect flash regions, allowing an attacker with local administrator privileges to write arbitrary code to the platform firmware. This could allow a remote attacker to install a persistent firmware level rootkit to the computer, or to erase the system firmware, causing a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to CompuLab not running *CloseMnf* prior to shipping. *CloseMnf* stands for “Close of Manufacturing” and hardens the system by setting write-protect flags for the various flash regions in the Master Access Section of the Descriptor Region.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of write protection on flash regions",
      "Unrestricted access to read and write system firmware for software running with local administrator privileges",
      "Firmware updates are not signed or verified before upgrade."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify the contents of the system firmware to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit, or to corrupt the firmware causing the computer to cease functioning. The modified firmware can be installed silently in the background, without user interaction, making it difficult to detect.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious executable with local administrator privileges",
      "Exploiting an OS-level vulnerability to gain local administrator privileges",
	  "Phishing email with malicious attachment"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local administrator privileges on the target system are required. No physical access is needed.",
    "additional_information": "The Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility can be used to silently update the firmware from the command line using the /remote2 option, which removes visual notifications. The vulnerability was present since the product release in 2013. A fix was provided by CompuLab, which enables write protection on the ME/BIOS/GbE regions of flash."
