# CVE-2017-8083: Intense PC lacks BIOS Write Protection

[6 Replies](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/#comments)

**Summary**

CompuLab Intense PC and MintBox 2 fail to properly write protect flash regions, allowing an attacker with local administrator privileges to write arbitrary code to the platform firmware. This could allow a remote attacker to install a persistent firmware level rootkit to the computer, or to erase the system firmware, causing a denial of service.

Installation of a modified firmware can occur entirely in the background, without any user interaction, and once performed is virtually impossible to difficult to detect using operating system utilities. Physical access is not required.

**Product description**

The CompuLab Intense PC is fanless mini-PC. A model pre-installed with Linux Mint is also marketed under the name *MintBox 2*. The system firmware is the same for the Intense PC and MintBox 2. CompuLab also sell the Intense PC with an extended temperature range for industrial applications.

The product was introduced in [mid-2013](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ready-to-run-desktop-linux-pc-mintbox-2/) and is still being sold through Amazon US, Amazon Canada, Amazon Germany, Amazon Spain, and directly from CompuLab.

**Affected products**

* Intense PC (Intense PC Value, Intense PC Business, Intense PC Pro)
* MintBox 2

At the time of discovery in March 2017, the [latest firmware](http://www.fit-pc.com/wiki/index.php/Intense_PC_BIOS_ROM_files) for CompuLab was dated 21 June 2016, and did not enable write protection on any flash regions.

**Impact**

Any software running with local administrator privileges has unrestricted access to read and write the system’s firmware.

An attacker can modify the contents of the system firmware to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit, or to corrupt the firmware causing the computer to cease functioning.

The attack only requires local administrator privileges, and can be executed either by using an existing OS-level exploit to gain local administrator, or via tricking the user into running an executable (e.g. via an attachment in a phishing email).

**Proof of Concept**

The firmware update from CompuLab was downloaded, decompressed, and loaded into [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool).

The default UEFI shell provided in Phoenix SecureCore was replaced with a newer version of the UEFI shell from [EDK2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/ShellBinPkg/UefiShell/X64):

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/UEFITool_replace_shell.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/UEFITool_replace_shell.png)

The Phoenix SecureCore UEFI Shell was replaced with the EDK2 UEFI Shell.

The modified update was then written to the system firmware using the Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/flashing.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/flashing.png)

Phoenix UEFI Winflash

It was later realized that the Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility includes a flag enabling a silent firmware update from the command line:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/winflash-remote2-crop.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/winflash-remote2-crop.png)

Phoenix UEFI Winflash supports silently updating the firmware from the command line

Using the */remote2* option removes all visual notifications that a firmware update is in progress. Additionally, when used with */console* or */remote2* options, the Winflash utility does not reboot the platform when finished. The system continues to function normally, and there is no indication to the user that a firmware update has taken place at all.

Output of the Intel Flash Programming Tool (FPT):

Intel’s fpt utility showing full write access to flash regions on the Intense PC

Through my discussion with CompuLab support, it has emerged that the issue is due to CompuLab not running *CloseMnf* prior to shipping. *CloseMnf* stands for “Close of Manufacturing” and hardens the system by setting write-protect flags for the various flash regions in the Master Access Section of the Descriptor Region.

Intel documentation regarding *CloseMnf*:

**Disclosure timeline**:

*1 March 2017:* Vulnerability is reported to CompuLab via their support email address

*2 March 2017:* CompuLab replies they will create a beta BIOS to address the vulnerability

*6 March 2017:* I request a timeline to fix the issue

*7 March 2017:* CompuLab replies they will create a beta BIOS for testing and they *“will provide an official public release in the future”*

*8 March 2017:* CompuLab replies with instructions to run closemnf via the Intel FPT tool

*8 March 2017:* I inform CompuLab I am waiting for the official BIOS update to resolve the issue

*8 March 2017:* CompuLab replies with copy of Intel FPT tool and requests *“not to publish or disclose this information”*

*8 March 2017:* CompuLab is informed that details of the vulnerability will be published on 4 June 2017

*23 April 2017:* Issue is reported to MITRE

*24 April 2017:* Vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-8083

*3 May 2017:* CompuLab communicates that they will delay fixing this vulnerability until Intel provides an updated ME firmware to address CVE-2017-5689

*4 May 2017:* I inform CompuLab that details of this vulnerability will be published on 4 June 2017 as previously discussed

*11 May 2017:* CompuLab sends a proposed fix for testing, the update script fails due to invalid command syntax for [flashrom](https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom)

*14 May 2017:* I inform CompuLab of the invalid syntax and provide the correct usage, and confirm that the fix enables write-protection on the ME/BIOS/GbE regions of flash

*15 May 2017:* CompuLab replies with a revised update script

*15 May 2017:* I inform CompuLab that the syntax of the revised script is correct, however my unit has already been updated so I cannot re-test

*4 June 2017:* Details of the vulnerability are published.

[CompuLab have provided an update](http://fit-pc.com/wiki/index.php/Security_updates) to address the issue.

I can confirm that the Phoenix update utility still functions so it is still possible to update the BIOS even after the FDR has been locked.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including

# CVE-2017-8083: Intense PC lacks BIOS Write Protection

[6 Replies](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/#comments)

**Summary**

CompuLab Intense PC and MintBox 2 fail to properly write protect flash regions, allowing an attacker with local administrator privileges to write arbitrary code to the platform firmware. This could allow a remote attacker to install a persistent firmware level rootkit to the computer, or to erase the system firmware, causing a denial of service.

Installation of a modified firmware can occur entirely in the background, without any user interaction, and once performed is virtually impossible to difficult to detect using operating system utilities. Physical access is not required.

**Product description**

The CompuLab Intense PC is fanless mini-PC. A model pre-installed with Linux Mint is also marketed under the name *MintBox 2*. The system firmware is the same for the Intense PC and MintBox 2. CompuLab also sell the Intense PC with an extended temperature range for industrial applications.

The product was introduced in [mid-2013](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ready-to-run-desktop-linux-pc-mintbox-2/) and is still being sold through Amazon US, Amazon Canada, Amazon Germany, Amazon Spain, and directly from CompuLab.

**Affected products**

* Intense PC (Intense PC Value, Intense PC Business, Intense PC Pro)
* MintBox 2

At the time of discovery in March 2017, the [latest firmware](http://www.fit-pc.com/wiki/index.php/Intense_PC_BIOS_ROM_files) for CompuLab was dated 21 June 2016, and did not enable write protection on any flash regions.

**Impact**

Any software running with local administrator privileges has unrestricted access to read and write the system’s firmware.

An attacker can modify the contents of the system firmware to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit, or to corrupt the firmware causing the computer to cease functioning.

The attack only requires local administrator privileges, and can be executed either by using an existing OS-level exploit to gain local administrator, or via tricking the user into running an executable (e.g. via an attachment in a phishing email).

**Proof of Concept**

The firmware update from CompuLab was downloaded, decompressed, and loaded into [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool).

The default UEFI shell provided in Phoenix SecureCore was replaced with a newer version of the UEFI shell from [EDK2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/ShellBinPkg/UefiShell/X64):

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/UEFITool_replace_shell.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/UEFITool_replace_shell.png)

The Phoenix SecureCore UEFI Shell was replaced with the EDK2 UEFI Shell.

The modified update was then written to the system firmware using the Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/flashing.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/flashing.png)

Phoenix UEFI Winflash

It was later realized that the Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility includes a flag enabling a silent firmware update from the command line:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/winflash-remote2-crop.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/winflash-remote2-crop.png)

Phoenix UEFI Winflash supports silently updating the firmware from the command line

Using the */remote2* option removes all visual notifications that a firmware update is in progress. Additionally, when used with */console* or */remote2* options, the Winflash utility does not reboot the platform when finished. The system continues to function normally, and there is no indication to the user that a firmware update has taken place at all.

Output of the Intel Flash Programming Tool (FPT):

Intel’s fpt utility showing full write access to flash regions on the Intense PC

Through my discussion with CompuLab support, it has emerged that the issue is due to CompuLab not running *CloseMnf* prior to shipping. *CloseMnf* stands for “Close of Manufacturing” and hardens the system by setting write-protect flags for the various flash regions in the Master Access Section of the Descriptor Region.

Intel documentation regarding *CloseMnf*:

**Disclosure timeline**:

*1 March 2017:* Vulnerability is reported to CompuLab via their support email address

*2 March 2017:* CompuLab replies they will create a beta BIOS to address the vulnerability

*6 March 2017:* I request a timeline to fix the issue

*7 March 2017:* CompuLab replies they will create a beta BIOS for testing and they *“will provide an official public release in the future”*

*8 March 2017:* CompuLab replies with instructions to run closemnf via the Intel FPT tool

*8 March 2017:* I inform CompuLab I am waiting for the official BIOS update to resolve the issue

*8 March 2017:* CompuLab replies with copy of Intel FPT tool and requests *“not to publish or disclose this information”*

*8 March 2017:* CompuLab is informed that details of the vulnerability will be published on 4 June 2017

*23 April 2017:* Issue is reported to MITRE

*24 April 2017:* Vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-8083

*3 May 2017:* CompuLab communicates that they will delay fixing this vulnerability until Intel provides an updated ME firmware to address CVE-2017-5689

*4 May 2017:* I inform CompuLab that details of this vulnerability will be published on 4 June 2017 as previously discussed

*11 May 2017:* CompuLab sends a proposed fix for testing, the update script fails due to invalid command syntax for [flashrom](https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom)

*14 May 2017:* I inform CompuLab of the invalid syntax and provide the correct usage, and confirm that the fix enables write-protection on the ME/BIOS/GbE regions of flash

*15 May 2017:* CompuLab replies with a revised update script

*15 May 2017:* I inform CompuLab that the syntax of the revised script is correct, however my unit has already been updated so I cannot re-test

*4 June 2017:* Details of the vulnerability are published.

[CompuLab have provided an update](http://fit-pc.com/wiki/index.php/Security_updates) to address the issue.

I can confirm that the Phoenix update utility still functions so it is still possible to update the BIOS even after the FDR has been locked.

# CompuLab MintBox 2 Review

[Leave a reply](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2014/02/mintbox-2-review/#respond)

**Update 11 December 2017: If you own a MintBox 2 or Intense PC and would like to run an open-source firmware which is not vulnerable to CVE-2017-8083 or CVE-2017-9457, [consider flashing coreboot](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/12/coreboot-compulab-intense-pc-mintbox/).**

**Update 30 July 2017: If you own a MintBox 2 or Intense PC your system is vulnerable to [CVE-2017-9457](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/07/cve-2017-9457-compulab-intense-pc-lacks-firmware-validation/). There is currently no planned fix for this vulnerability.**

**Update 6 June 2017: If you own a MintBox 2 or Intense PC, please update your system firmware to the [latest version (21 May 2017)](http://fit-pc.com/download/intense-pc/bios/21-05-2017/IPCBIOS-21-05-2017_2.2.400.3.zip). Your system is vulnerable to [CVE-2017-8083](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/).**

CompuLab’s MintBox 2 is a small embedded computer designed for home, office or industrial applications that retails for $599 US. The MintBox 2 ships with Linux Mint 15 “Olivia” on it, which was supported until January 2014 (last month).

The specifications of the MintBox 2 are:

Intel Core i5 3337U (Dual-core 1.8GHz, 2.7GHz turbo, 17W)

4GB RAM (2x2GB; DDR3 1333 CL9 SODIMMs)

500GB hard drive (2.5″, 5400RPM, Hitachi HCC547550A9E380)

Dual Gigabit Ethernet (Intel and Realtek 8111F; both integrated)

Realtek 802.11b/g/n 2.4GHz WiFi/Bluetooth 3.0 combo card (RTL8723AE; half-height mini-PCIe)

Also present are two eSATA ports (SATA 300), a full size mini-PCIe which can also double as mSATA, DisplayPort and HDMI (CEC is **not** supported) video outputs, and 3.5mm audio in/out which also support S/PDIF (coax).

The MintBox 2 comes with a 60 month warranty (5 years), with the hard drive being covered for 24 months (2 years).

The shipping configuration uses legacy booting and partitions instead of EFI booting and LVM.

> Disk /dev/sda: 465.8 GiB, 500107862016 bytes, 976773168 sectors
>
> Units: sectors of 1 \* 512 = 512 bytes
>
> Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
>
> I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
>
> Disklabel type: dos

>
> /dev/sda2 968752048 976773167 4010560 82 Linux swap / Solaris

Encrypting user’s home is supported and offers reasonable speeds, but since user data is stored on the same partition as the OS you may run into trouble if you try to upgrade Linux Mint or install another distribution.

The MintBox 2 supposedly supports up to 16GB of memory, and indeed I had no issues with the 4GB installed, or with an 8GB (2x4GB) kit from Patriot memory. I tried three different 16GB kits (G.SKILL, Patriot, Micron) in the MintBox 2, and all three were incompatible. As such, I **highly** recommend you consult the list of approved memory modules before purchasing a 16GB kit for the MintBox 2. I am awaiting a 16GB kit that was certified to work with the MintBox 2 and will update this post when it arrives.

People familiar with Linux Mint will know what the standard user interface is like, and the MintBox 2 does not deviate from it apart from a cheeky MintBox 2 wallpaper. Everything works out of the box, with ethernet and wireless configured for DHCP. Suspend to RAM works well and performance is on par with other dual-core computers running Linux Mint.

I installed Arch Linux on my MintBox 2 using EFI boot. This requires reformatting the hard drive completely to use a GPT partitioning scheme. An EFI service partition is required to store the grub boot loader, unless you opt to use the EFI stub in the linux kernel (which I did not). You will also have to boot from live media and use the efibootmgr tool to insert a boot record into EFI nvram to point to your boot loader or you will be sitting sadly in the [seemingly] useless EFI shell wondering why it won’t boot.

As with most other consumer electronics, there is little to no option to tweak in the EFI configuration utility (“BIOS”). There are no voltage monitors, and only the CPU temperature sensor is available over SMBus. Users do not have control over CPU speed, C-states, memory frequency or timings. There is an option for whether the full-height mini-PCIe slot is mSATA or regular mini-PCIe, and users can choose to enable or disable Virtualization (VT-x; VT-d is not supported by the HM76 chipset).

The December 2013 firmware update provides users with the ability to pre-define how much memory to share with the IGP (128MB, 256MB or 512MB) which is reserved and unavailable to the OS. I believe previous firmware versions dynamically allocate VRAM based on the Intel IGP driver requests from the OS.

Depending on the workload the CPU temperature can vary from mid-40s to mid-70s (Celsius), but is almost never hotter. This is average for a mobile CPU and well within safe limits. The stock RAM hits mid-60s in heavy use, but DIMMs with 16 chips (as opposed to 8) run in the mid-70s.

CompuLab support was a little lacklustre at first, but improved tremendously after I discussed my issues with the MintBox product manager. They issued an RMA and replaced the unit to see if the compatibility issue was isolated, but the replacement has the same issues.

Overall the MintBox 2 is a very nice computer. The MintBox 2 is a fanless design, which is very nice from a noise perspective but certainly won’t win it any awards in the design department. The connectivity options are very nice, and exceed what other manufacturers are offering in a small form-factor fanless PC.

I was torn between buying a MintBox 2 and a Mac Mini. I liked the MintBox 2 connectivity options, even though it lacks ThunderBolt, and the fanless design was a bonus. The MintBox 2 also uses a lower TDP CPU than the Mac Mini (17W versus 35W), but is clocked lower.

If you want to buy a computer that works out of the box with Linux and don’t mind paying a premium for it, then the MintBox 2 is an excellent choice. However, the Mac Mini does give you more connectivity options (4xUSB 3.0, FW800 and ThunderBolt) and is compatible with almost all 16GB memory kits available on the market.

**Pros:**

+ Low-power

+ Fanless

+ I/O options without purchasing expensive adaptors

+ 5-year warranty

+ **[coreboot](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/12/coreboot-compulab-intense-pc-mintbox/)!** (added December 2017)

**Cons:**

– Limited support for 16GB of RAM

– Limited I/O (no ThunderBolt)

– RMA requires shipping the unit to CompuLab’s US or Israel office which means about 2 weeks without your computer (as opposed to bringing the Mac Mini in to an Apple store and getting it fixed/replaced within a day or two)

– **Multiple security vulnerabilities present in the system firmware** (added July 2017)

Update: I installed the Corsair CT2CP102464BF1339 16GB kit and it seems to be working well in the MintBox. I also measured the power usage of the MintBox. At idle the MintBox draws 11W (110V mains) and under full load it draws around 27W.

Vendor:
====================
CompuLab (compulab.com)

Product:
====================
Intense PC / MintBox 2

Vulnerability type:
====================
Write-protection not enabled on system firmware

CVE Reference:
====================
CVE-2017-8083

Summary:
====================
Since 2013 CompuLab manufactures and sells the IntensePC/MintBox 2, which is a small Intel-based fanless PC sold to
end-users and industrial customers. It was discovered that in the default configuration write-protection is not enabled
for the BIOS/ME/GbE regions of flash.

CompuLab have created a patch to resolve the issue, however they have not yet released the patch publicly. This
vulnerability is being published as the 90 day disclosure deadline has been reached.

Affected versions:
====================
All firmware versions since product release (latest public firmware is 21 June 2016)

Attack Vector:
====================
An attacker tricks the user into running a malicious executable with local administrator privileges, which updates the
system firmware to include the attacker's code. The attacker may instead use a known OS exploit to perform the upgrade
remotely (without user interaction or notification).

Proof of concept:
====================
I have created a modified firmware update which replaces the stock UEFI shell with the UEFI shell from EDK2. The update
can be flashed from within Windows without any user interaction or notification. Firmware updates are not signed by
CompuLab or verified by the existing firmware before upgrade.

The modified update can be downloaded here:
<https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/update-IPC-20160621-edk2.zip>

Details of the full proof of concept can be found at the Source link above.

Disclosure timeline:
====================
1 March 2017: Vulnerability is reported to CompuLab via their support email address
2 March 2017: CompuLab replies they will create a beta BIOS to address the vulnerability
6 March 2017: I request a timeline to fix the issue
7 March 2017: CompuLab replies they will create a beta BIOS for testing and they “will provide an official public
release in the future”
8 March 2017: CompuLab replies with instructions to run closemnf via the Intel FPT tool
8 March 2017: I inform CompuLab I am waiting for the official BIOS update to resolve the issue
8 March 2017: CompuLab replies with copy of Intel FPT tool and requests “not to publish or disclose this information”
8 March 2017: CompuLab is informed that details of the vulnerability will be published on 4 June 2017
23 April 2017: Issue is reported to MITRE
24 April 2017: Vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-8083
3 May 2017: CompuLab communicates that they will delay fixing this vulnerability until Intel provides an updated ME
firmware to address CVE-2017-5689
4 May 2017: I inform CompuLab that details of this vulnerability will be published on 4 June 2017 as previously
discussed
11 May 2017: CompuLab sends a proposed fix for testing, the update script fails due to invalid command syntax for
flashrom
14 May 2017: I inform CompuLab of the invalid syntax and provide the correct usage, and confirm that the fix enables
write-protection on the ME/BIOS/GbE regions of flash
15 May 2017: CompuLab replies with a revised update script
15 May 2017: I inform CompuLab that the syntax of the revised script is correct, however my unit has already been
updated so I cannot re-test
4 June 2017: Details of the vulnerability are published.

The Gigabyte MJ11-EC1 motherboard is an ITX motherboard with an AMD EPYC 3151 (4C8T) onboard. These motherboards were being liquidated from the [Gigabyte G431-MM0 GPU server](https://web.archive.org/web/20240407012914/https%3A//www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G431-MM0-rev-100) in 2023, and could be purchased for [around 60 Euros](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/gigabyte-mj11-ec1-epyc-3151-mystery.41395/) in the EU. The bare-bones G431-MM0 can still be purchased for around 170 Euros.

The MJ11-EC1 is very similar to the [Gigabyte MJ11-EC0](https://web.archive.org/web/20220127172803/https%3A//www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/Server-Motherboard/MJ11-EC0-rev-12) with the main difference being the MJ11-EC0 has a PCIe x16 slot while the MJ11-EC1 has a SlimSAS (SFF-8654 8i) connector for use with the GPU riser in the G431-MM0.

You can purchase the SlimSAS cable (~18 Euros) and a PCIe riser (~15 Euros) from several AliExpress sellers. The added cost of the cable and PCIe riser does reduce the value proposition of the motherboard somewhat. Additionally, [user testing](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/gigabyte-mj11-ec1-epyc-3151-mystery.41395/page-4#post-397607) showed that PCIe bifurcation was non-functional on the SlimSAS port, meaning only a single PCIe device could be recognized on the SlimSAS 8i port unless a PCIe switch was used.

However, I can demonstrate that bifurcation does work on the MJ11-EC1, and in fact it is possible to access all PCIe x16 lanes if you add the unpopulated U2\_1 SFF-8654 connector. All the passive components for the SFF-8654 connector are already present on the motherboard, so only the physical connector needs to be added to unlock an additional 8 lanes of PCIe.

Two MJ11-EC1 motherboards, one with U2\_1 unpopulated and one with a SlimSAS 8i connector soldered

However, PCIe Bifurcation does not work under every condition. The following scenarios **do not work**:

| Cable | Adapter | Bifurcation working |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SlimSAS 8i to dual 4i | SlimSAS 4i to PCIe x4 | **No** |
| SlimSAS 8i to 8i | SlimSAS 8i to Dual NVMe | **No** |
| Dual SlimSAS 8i to 8i | PCIe x16 (JHHP1B) | **No** |

The first attempt was with a SlimSAS 8i to dual 4i cable. Unfortunately, bifurcation did not work with this cable, only one device was visible.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-4i-cable.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-4i-cable.png)

Only one device is recognized

The second attempt was with a SlimSAS 8i to dual NVMe adapter. Again, only the first NVMe device was visible, so I do not recommend purchasing this for use with the MJ11-EC1.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-DualNVMe.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-DualNVMe.png)

Only one device is recognized

I then tried this dual SlimSAS 8i to PCIe x16 adapter, which did not work **at all**. In my subsequent discussion with the vendor in the AliExpress dispute, it appears this adapter is **only compatible with their PCIe x16 to SlimSAS riser**. So despite using the SFF-8654 connector, it is not standards compliant with SlimSAS 8i and cannot be used with the MJ11-EC1. Do not purchase this.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-PCIex16-JHHP1B-2.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-PCIex16-JHHP1B-2.png)

This adapter does not work at all. Avoid purchasing the “2 Port SlimSAS 8i x2 to PCIe 4.0 x16 Slot Adapter Card SFF8654 Riser Card GEN4”

---

The following combinations are fully functional:

| Cable | Adapter | BIOS configuration | PCIe devices | Bifurcation working |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SlimSAS 8i to 8i | PCIe x8 | x8x8 | 2 | **Yes** |
| SlimSAS 8i to 8i | PCIe x8 with 4xNVMe riser, 2xNVMe | x8x4x4 | 3 | **Yes** |
| SlimSAS 8i to 8i | PCIe x8 with 4xNVMe riser, 2xNVMe | x4x4x4x4 | 4 | **Yes** |

The following SlimSAS 8i to PCIe x8 adapters were used during testing and worked as expected. The adapters were purchased with my own funds and I have no relationship to the brands or sellers.

CEACENT CNS41CX16W

The CEACENT CNS41CX16W places a decoupling capacitor (C21) in the path of the power connector. Cover this in glue/epoxy or it will get knocked off the board.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/N-P548-A.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/N-P548-A.png)

“SFF-8654 8i to PCIe 4.0 x16 External Graphics Card Adapter SFF-8654 8i Adapter Card” N-P548-A

The designer of this adapter does not seem to have considered the lack of clearance between the SFF-8654 and SATA power connector. I would call it “challenging” to plug in the SFF-8654 connector.

Most SFF-8654 to PCIe x8 adapters from China seem to have fundamentally flawed physical layouts, which is unfortunate given they are otherwise inexpensive and effective.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PH44PRO.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PH44PRO.png)

This NVMe adapter is great, my only wish is that they made a 1U compatible 2 NVMe version as inexpensive as the 4 NVMe model.

There are dual SlimSAS 8i to PCIe x16 adapters available, however they are cost prohibitive. Given the PCIe bifurcation options available in BIOS and the fact that there are 16 accessible PCIe lanes, I suspect a standards-compliant adapter (e.g. Ceacent CNS52CX16R) would work to expose all 16 lanes.

This was a fun modification but the economic case is dubious at best. With the SFF-8654 8i cables being roughly 18 Euros each, and SlimSAS 8i to PCIe x8 adapters ranging in price from 18-22 Euros (+shipping) the additional cost to fully utilise 16 PCIe lanes easily exceeds the entire cost of the motherboard.

The SFF-8654 connector (Amphenol U10-B074-200T) proved very hard to source from Western Distributors as they are discontinued, and are not available at a reasonable price on AliExpress. I ended up purchasing them on Taobao via a Chinese based forwarding service. The cost for QTY 20 was 523¥ on Taobao, plus forwarding agent fees, shipping to Europe, and VAT.

Soldering the connector is also a nightmare. The ground plane on the MJ11-EC1 is very effective at dissipating heat. I used a pre-heater, hot air station (set to 200C with high flow to avoid melting the plastic), leaded solder, sticky flux, and still required some touch up work with a very fine tip on the soldering iron to fix bad connections.

It should be noted that bifurcation of the populated `U2_2` SFF-8654 port works. Anyone owning the MJ11-EC1 wishing to do that just needs to flash the MJ11-EC0 BIOS via the BMC to expose PCIe bifurcation settings in BIOS, and they should be able to install two PCIe x4 devices (subject to the limitations mentioned above regarding cables/risers).

# [Meraki MG21 hardware overview and secure boot bypass](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/09/meraki-mg21-hardware-overview-and-secure-boot-bypass/)

[Leave a reply](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/09/meraki-mg21-hardware-overview-and-secure-boot-bypass/#respond)

The Meraki MG21, introduced in 2019, is a Cat 6 LTE gateway intended for fail-over connectivity. It features a soldered modem module and either two internal (MG21) or two external (MG21E) antennas.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-HW.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-HW.jpg)

Meraki MG21 LTE gateway

Here is a summary of the MG21 specs:

* Qualcomm [IPQ4029](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/networking/wi-fi-networks/ipq4029) (ARM A7, 4 cores @ ~700MHz)
* 512MB DDR3 RAM (soldered)
* 128MB of NAND flash ([Winbond W29N01HV](https://web.archive.org/web/20240827113306/https%3A//www.winbond.com/hq/product/code-storage-flash-memory/slc-nand-flash/?__locale=en&partNo=W29N01HV))
* Cinterion PLAS9-X LTE Cat 6 modem module (LCC, soldered)
* Gigabit Ethernet (x2, QCA8072 PHY)
* Nano-SIM slot

---

There are no screws holding the MG21 together, the case is glued. As Meraki used glue and not adhesive to hold the MG21 together, heat does not help in opening the device. To open the MG21/MG21E: guitar picks and Isopropyl alcohol are recommended, with a lot of patience.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-disassembly.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-disassembly.jpg)

Opening the MG21 with guitar picks and Isopropyl alcohol

The 3.3V UART header in the MG21 is J5, which is unpopulated, and follows the standard Meraki pinout (1: VCC, 2: Tx, 3: Rx, 4: GND) with a 115200 baud rate. It looks like Meraki may have planned to ship the MG21 with an integrated u-blox module (U22), however on my production units the module is absent.

With the summary aside, let us focus on the secure boot status of the device. For context, see [Breaking secure boot on the Meraki Z3 and Meraki Go GX20](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/04/breaking-secure-boot-on-the-meraki-z3-and-meraki-go-gx20/).

*Foreshadowing*: You will notice that this output is very similar to that of the Z3 and GX20.

Unfortunately changing the EEPROM value to the MR33 (stinkbug) does not work, because Meraki have removed support for the legacy non-secure boot devices from recent U-Boot builds:

```

Removing the BGA NAND and replacing the `u-boot` region with a dump of the Z3 2018 U-Boot build, U-Boot is still performing signature validation:

```

U-Boot 2017.07-RELEASE-g39cabb9bf3 (May 24 2018 - 14:07:32 -0700)

DRAM:  242 MiB
machid : 0x8010001
NAND:  ONFI device found
128 MiB
Using default environment

(...)

Secure boot enabled.

```

The reason for this is that the EEPROM is not found. But why? We have a clue from the stock bootlog of the device:

```

[   15.287320] i2c /dev entries driver
[   15.302889] at24 0-0056: 8192 byte 24c64 EEPROM, writable, 32 bytes/write

```

The EEPROM in the MG21 has the address `0x56` instead of `0x50` as on the Z3. This causes the downgraded Z3 U-Boot build to not detect the EEPROM.

The Meraki Go GR10 (Maggot) [also has the EEPROM at address `0x56`](https://github.com/halmartin/u-boot-z3/blob/main/U-boot.Z3/board/qca/arm/ipq40xx/meraki_config.c#L57-L62):

```

struct eeprom_i2c_config
{
	uint16_t gpio_scl;
	uint16_t gpio_scl_func;
	uint16_t gpio_sda;
	uint16_t gpio_sda_func;
	uint16_t eeprom_addr;
};
/* valid eeprom configuration for insects */
static const struct eeprom_i2c_config valid_eeprom_i2c_config[] = {
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x50 }, // Stinkbug, Ladybug, Noisy Cricket
    { 10, 4, 11, 4, 0x56 }, // Maggot
};

```

However, the GR10 uses different GPIO pins to access the EEPROM.

I do not have the U-Boot source code of the MG21 to review (see endnote). Lacking the U-Boot source code, we can `hexdump` the Z3 and MG21 U-Boot regions from the flash dumps and compare.

Z3:

```

Decoding the structs from the `hexdump` we can infer the C source code used in the MG21 U-Boot build:

```

static const struct eeprom_i2c_config valid_eeprom_i2c_config[] = {
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x50 }, // Fuzzy Cricket, Fairyfly, Heart of Gold
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x56 }, // Tie Fighter
};

```

The only difference between the MG21 and Z3 is in the EEPROM address, the GPIO configuration remains the same.

Reviewing the datasheet of the at24 EEPROM, we can see that the address is set by the first 3 pins (A0-A2) being pulled to ground or Vcc. Since the EEPROM has the address 0x56, that must correspond to the bitmask 110 or: A0: 0, A1: Vcc, A2: Vcc.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/at24c64-MG21.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/at24c64-MG21.png)

After some verification on the PCB, removing the surface mount resistor R50 (4.7k) above U6 will remove Vcc from A1 and A2, changing the EEPROM address from `0x56` to `0x50`.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-U6-EEPROM.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-U6-EEPROM.jpg)

The signed Z3 2018 U-Boot build now properly detects the EEPROM at address `0x50` and disables signature validation on the payload.

The chain-loaded U-Boot I used as a proof-of-concept is based on the [Z3 GPL source code provided by Meraki in 2021](https://github.com/halmartin/u-boot-z3), which does not include support for the MG21. Networking is non-functional, which makes further development challenging as images must be (slowly) transferred via UART.

---

Some readers may be wondering about the MG41. This secure boot bypass does not work on the MG41.

Meraki has signed the MG41 bootloader with a unique device certificate (`x-wing`), so cross-flashing U-Boot from another device such as the Z3 will not work.

Although the FCC internal photos of the MG41 show both NAND and EMMC, the production MG41 has only EMMC present. The `boot_meraki_qca` function has been re-written as `boot_meraki_mmc_qca`. During this re-write, Meraki removed the vulnerable `switch` statement that aborts enforcing signature validation on legacy products.

---

tl;dr

1. MG21 uses the same device signing certificate as the Z3 and GX20
2. Overwrite `u-boot` on NAND with dump from Z3 running 2018 release
3. Change Product ID in EEPROM to device without secure boot (MR33)
4. Desolder R50 to change EEPROM address

The MG41 is not vulnerable to this technique.

| MG21E | Tie Fighter | 600-89010 |
| MG41 | X-Wing | 600-119020 |
| MG41E | X-Wing | (unknown, let me know in comments) |

---

There is still a long road ahead to support the MG21 with any custom firmware such as OpenWrt. Downgrading U-Boot on the device is not easy due to the weather proofing of the device, and the use of BGA NAND.

The GPL source code for the MG21 and MG41 was [requested from Meraki](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b7a8bdb6f5abb7adaabbbd98b5bdaab9b3b1f6bbb7b5e7abadbab2bdbbace59f8894f88bb7adaabbbdf89bb7bcbdf88abda9adbdabac) in April 2024. At the time of writing Meraki has not provided any of the requested source code.

Meraki [announced the end of sale of the MG21 and MG41 in March 2024](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Meraki_End-of-Life_%28EOL%29_Products_and_Dates), and stopped selling the MG21 and MG41 on 2024-09-18.

Meraki tries to be the Apple of SMB networking, and frequently uses premium materials like aluminum in their product designs (MS220, MS320, [MS225](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2022/10/meraki-ms210-ms225-hardware-overview/), [MS350](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2023/12/meraki-ms350-hardware-overview/), [MX84](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2023/02/meraki-mx84-overview/)). This is a bit silly for something that sits in a rack, but it is the brand image they were trying to cultivate.

The MX85 does not appear to use any aluminum in the chassis. Like the budget-oriented MS120 series, the entire MX85 chassis is made of steel. Meraki marketing will tell you this was for better cooling and is definitely not related to any cost reduction.

Meraki engineers even included thermal pads and metal spacers on top of the SFP ports (and below the PCB) to dissipate heat through the chassis. You could be forgiven for assuming they are SFP+ ports (they are not) with so much attention given to heat dissipation.

All for a device which consumes less power at idle than the (also) passively-cooled MX84, and no longer includes a spinning hard drive.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-ledboard.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-ledboard.jpg)

Unlike previous products, Meraki use glue to secure the front panel ribbon cable

---

The UART header is J3 on the MX85 and follows the standard Meraki UART pinout (1: VCC, 2: Tx, 3: Rx, 4: GND) at 3.3V and 115200 baud.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-uart.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-uart.jpg)

**Note**: R6 and R7 are 0 ohm resistors which (dis)connect Tx and Rx lines of the SoC to the UART header. R6/R7 are **not populated by default**. You must populate them, or bridge the pads, for the UART header to function.

---

The U-Boot release on the MX85 is `2018.09julia-spl-boxwine` and, like all other recent Meraki products, it does not allow interrupting boot.

As we can see from the above `ECC off` output, the MX85 is using non-ECC RAM. This is a downgrade from the MX84 which did use ECC memory.

The MX85 also contains the Cisco TAM, implemented using a SmartFusion2 M2S010. The TAM is used for secure boot.

It would seem that Meraki prefers their customers purchase an MG41 or MG51 than plug in their own USB LTE modem. Better margins and less to support, win-win!

# CVE-2017-9457: CompuLab Intense PC lacks firmware signature validation

[5 Replies](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/07/cve-2017-9457-compulab-intense-pc-lacks-firmware-validation/#comments)

**Summary**

CompuLab have not enabled signature checking of firmware updates for the Intense PC product line. This allows anyone in possession of the Phoenix UEFI update program to write a modified UEFI firmware to system flash. DOS/Windows versions of the Phoenix utility are easily obtained online, allowing a local or remote attacker to install a persistent firmware level rootkit to the computer, or to corrupt the system firmware, causing a denial of service.

Installation of a modified firmware can occur entirely in the background, without any user interaction, and once performed is virtually impossible to difficult to detect using operating system utilities. Physical access is not required.

**Product description**

The CompuLab Intense PC is fanless mini-PC. A model pre-installed with Linux Mint is also marketed under the name *MintBox 2*. The system firmware is the same for the Intense PC and MintBox 2. CompuLab also sell the Intense PC with an extended temperature range for industrial applications.

The product was introduced in [mid-2013](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ready-to-run-desktop-linux-pc-mintbox-2/) and is still being sold through Amazon US, Amazon Canada, Amazon Germany, Amazon Spain, and directly from CompuLab.

**Affected products**

* Intense PC (Intense PC Value, Intense PC Business, Intense PC Pro)
* MintBox 2

**Impact**

Any software running with local administrator privileges has unrestricted access to read and write the system’s firmware.

An attacker can modify the contents of the system firmware to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit, or to corrupt the firmware causing the computer to cease functioning.

The attack only requires local administrator privileges, and can be executed either by using an existing OS-level exploit to gain local administrator, or via tricking the user into running an executable (e.g. via an attachment in a phishing email).

**Proof of Concept**

The proof of concept provided for CVE-2017-8083 can be leveraged for this vulnerability as well. The proof of concept uses the Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility to write a modified firmware to flash. Please [refer to the article about CVE-2017-8083](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/) for a detailed description of the proof of concept.

The latest CompuLab firmware for the Intense PC (20170521) modified with the upstream EDKII shell can be downloaded [here](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-IPC-20170521-edk2.zip).

**Mitigation**

At this time there is no means for the end user to enable Capsule Signature verification or to prevent the Phoenix update utility from updating the system firmware.

Therefore Intense PC owners should consider the following options:

* Ensure your operating system is up to date with the latest security patches. Do not run software from untrusted sources.
* Do not connect your Intense PC to any networks with internet access (i.e. air-gap the computer).
* Discontinue your use of the Intense PC and *consider replacing the computer with one from a different manufacturer who implements signature validation for firmware updates*.

Should CompuLab decide to improve the security of the Intense PC firmware by enabling Capsule Signature validation, then the above recommendations would no longer apply. However, in my communication with CompuLab regarding this issue no indication was given that they have any plans to enable Capsule Signature verification in a future update. Therefore, it seems very unlikely to me CompuLab will issue an update which enables Capsule Signature verification.

**Disclosure timeline**:

*6 June 2017:* Issue reported to CompuLab

*6 June 2017:* CompuLab confirms that “Default settings of this source tree [Phoenix SecureCore Tiano Enhanced Intel Ivy Bridge CPU Panther Point M] has disabled Capsule Signature option.”

*6 June 2017:* Issue is reported to MITRE

*6 June 2017:* Vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-9457

*7 June 2017:* CompuLab are informed that the vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2017-9457 and details of the vulnerability will be published after 45 days

   I do disagree with the idea that firmware signature validation should be mandatory (which you seem to promote), as it usually makes it impossible for free software projects like Coreboot to make compatible ports. The benefits with Coreboot are that we can get a better idea of what is running on the computer (therefore more secure) and faster boot times. Some vendor BIOSes restricts what wifi cards can be used and that is not in the user’s interest, too.

   I think it would be better with firmware signature validation that can be turned off by the user (of course in the BIOS, not from OS level).

      > I think it would be better with firmware signature validation that can be turned off by the user (of course in the BIOS, not from OS level).

      I didn’t mean to imply that the only way forward was to strictly enforce firmware signature validation. So I agree with you that the option to enforce signed firmware updates should be a requirement for anyone designing a computer.

      In the old days of BIOS, there was a write-protect jumper you could select to prevent BIOS updates. With UEFI, such a jumper is not possible anymore as flash is partitioned between ROM and EEPROM components (e.g. saving UEFI boot entries) and a write-protect jumper on the hardware part would prevent fundamental parts of UEFI from correctly functioning. Therefore write-protection must be implemented at a software level.

      The fact that a firmware signature validation option is missing completely is a huge security oversight by CompuLab and leaves their users open to malicious software installing rogue firmware updates or bricking the device. Sadly they have not shown any interest in including a firmware signature validation option.

      > The benefits with Coreboot are that we can get a better idea of what is running on the computer (therefore more secure)

      This isn’t necessarily true. Most complaints about x86 platform security stem from the [Intel Management Engine (IME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology) which Coreboot can’t disable on newer platforms (such as this one). Additionally, at a firmware level a lot of code is very specific to the exact hardware in question, and may rely on proprietary/NDA-level information (e.g. IOMMU) to achieve the same functionality as proprietary code it aims to replace.

      Having a FLOSS firmware will not necessarily lead to more people being able to improve it or fix bugs. I think this is well illustrated in the extremely small number of targets Coreboot supports.

   Gustaf, you may be pleased to hear that [I have ported coreboot to this hardware](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/12/coreboot-compulab-intense-pc-mintbox/), so the vendor’s lack of signature verification/enforcement is no longer a concern 🙂

This allows anyone in possession of the Phoenix UEFI update program to write a modified UEFI firmware to system flash. DOS/Windows versions of the Phoenix utility are easily obtained online, allowing a local or remote attacker to install a persistent firmware level rootkit to the computer, or to corrupt the system firmware, causing a denial of service.

Installation of a modified firmware can occur entirely in the background, without any user interaction, and once performed is virtually impossible to difficult to detect using operating system utilities. Physical access is not required.

**Product description**

The CompuLab Intense PC is fanless mini-PC. A model pre-installed with Linux Mint is also marketed under the name *MintBox 2*. The system firmware is the same for the Intense PC and MintBox 2. CompuLab also sell the Intense PC with an extended temperature range for industrial applications.

The product was introduced in [mid-2013](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ready-to-run-desktop-linux-pc-mintbox-2/) and is still being sold through Amazon US, Amazon Canada, Amazon Germany, Amazon Spain, and directly from CompuLab.

**Affected products**

* Intense PC (Intense PC Value, Intense PC Business, Intense PC Pro)
* MintBox 2

**Impact**

Any software running with local administrator privileges has unrestricted access to read and write the system’s firmware.

An attacker can modify the contents of the system firmware to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit, or to corrupt the firmware causing the computer to cease functioning.

The attack only requires local administrator privileges, and can be executed either by using an existing OS-level exploit to gain local administrator, or via tricking the user into running an executable (e.g. via an attachment in a phishing email).

**Proof of Concept**

The proof of concept provided for CVE-2017-8083 can be leveraged for this vulnerability as well. The proof of concept uses the Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility to write a modified firmware to flash. Please [refer to the article about CVE-2017-8083](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/) for a detailed description of the proof of concept.

The latest CompuLab firmware for the Intense PC (20170521) modified with the upstream EDKII shell can be downloaded [here](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-IPC-20170521-edk2.zip).

**Mitigation**

At this time there is no means for the end user to enable Capsule Signature verification or to prevent the Phoenix update utility from updating the system firmware.

Therefore Intense PC owners should consider the following options:

* Ensure your operating system is up to date with the latest security patches. Do not run software from untrusted sources.
* Do not connect your Intense PC to any networks with internet access (i.e. air-gap the computer).
* Discontinue your use of the Intense PC and *consider replacing the computer with one from a different manufacturer who implements signature validation for firmware updates*.

Should CompuLab decide to improve the security of the Intense PC firmware by enabling Capsule Signature validation, then the above recommendations would no longer apply. However, in my communication with CompuLab regarding this issue no indication was given that they have any plans to enable Capsule Signature verification in a future update. Therefore, it seems very unlikely to me CompuLab will issue an update which enables Capsule Signature verification.

   I do disagree with the idea that firmware signature validation should be mandatory (which you seem to promote), as it usually makes it impossible for free software projects like Coreboot to make compatible ports. The benefits with Coreboot are that we can get a better idea of what is running on the computer (therefore more secure) and faster boot times. Some vendor BIOSes restricts what wifi cards can be used and that is not in the user’s interest, too.

   I think it would be better with firmware signature validation that can be turned off by the user (of course in the BIOS, not from OS level).

      > I think it would be better with firmware signature validation that can be turned off by the user (of course in the BIOS, not from OS level).

      I didn’t mean to imply that the only way forward was to strictly enforce firmware signature validation. So I agree with you that the option to enforce signed firmware updates should be a requirement for anyone designing a computer.

      In the old days of BIOS, there was a write-protect jumper you could select to prevent BIOS updates. With UEFI, such a jumper is not possible anymore as flash is partitioned between ROM and EEPROM components (e.g. saving UEFI boot entries) and a write-protect jumper on the hardware part would prevent fundamental parts of UEFI from correctly functioning. Therefore write-protection must be implemented at a software level.

      The fact that a firmware signature validation option is missing completely is a huge security oversight by CompuLab and leaves their users open to malicious software installing rogue firmware updates or bricking the device. Sadly they have not shown any interest in including a firmware signature validation option.

      > The benefits with Coreboot are that we can get a better idea of what is running on the computer (therefore more secure)

      This isn’t necessarily true. Most complaints about x86 platform security stem from the [Intel Management Engine (IME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology) which Coreboot can’t disable on newer platforms (such as this one). Additionally, at a firmware level a lot of code is very specific to the exact hardware in question, and may rely on proprietary/NDA-level information (e.g. IOMMU) to achieve the same functionality as proprietary code it aims to replace.

      Having a FLOSS firmware will not necessarily lead to more people being able to improve it or fix bugs. I think this is well illustrated in the extremely small number of targets Coreboot supports.

   Gustaf, you may be pleased to hear that [I have ported coreboot to this hardware](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/12/coreboot-compulab-intense-pc-mintbox/), so the vendor’s lack of signature verification/enforcement is no longer a concern 🙂
