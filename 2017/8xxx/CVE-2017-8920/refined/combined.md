Certain places firewall TCP ports other than the most common ports. There are
[many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol#SSH_tunneling) [techniques](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH_VPN) for [bypassing](http://www.daemon.be/maarten/dnstunnel.html) such [restrictions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549). One
simple approach is to run a SSH daemon on port 443, however a downside of this
is you need to dedicate an IP address to this SSH service.

There's a new release out, with a security fix:

* CVE-2017-8920: XSS in 'R' parameter. Thanks to Niklaus Schiess for discovering this.
