Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8920:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the 'R' parameter within the `irc.cgi` script of CGI:IRC. Specifically, the `error('Communication socket name is invalid') if $cgi->{R} =~ /[^A-Za-z0-9]/;` check was missing prior to the fix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious code into the 'R' parameter, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to perform malicious actions on behalf of the victim user, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other unwanted actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The 'R' parameter is likely part of the URL used to access `irc.cgi`. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing injected JavaScript code within this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs with malicious content in the 'R' parameter. This could involve sending the crafted link to a target through various channels, or using other methods to trick them into visiting the vulnerable URL.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix in commit `46dd48442204207b52c16065ad67d294194afd8d` adds the missing validation for the 'R' parameter, which now checks that it contains only alphanumeric characters. This prevents the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within this parameter.
- The blog post on cgiirc.org explicitly mentions "XSS in 'R' parameter" as the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8920.
