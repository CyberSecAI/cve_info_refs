  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it to construct HTML output.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, cookie theft, information disclosure, and redirection to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by sending a POST request to the 'param' parameter of the `/home/seos/courier/user_add.html` page. The injected script is then executed when the server reflects this unsanitized input back to the user's browser.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can craft a malicious POST request to the affected URL, injecting the JavaScript payload within the 'param' parameter."
