- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation on four TCP listening ports in FusionSphere OpenStack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can gain root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malicious commands through the vulnerable TCP listening ports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be in the adjacent network where FusionSphere OpenStack resides.

The advisory provides more detail than the official CVE description by identifying the specific affected product (FusionSphere OpenStack), affected and fixed versions, the specific TCP ports, and the specific attack vector (sending malicious commands). It also provides a CVSS v3 score and details on the required attacker capabilities (adjacent network).
