Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8441:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Document Level Security (DLS) is applied to index aliases within X-Pack Security.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper DLS enforcement:** Document Level Security was not consistently applied to index aliases. This allowed users to bypass intended access restrictions.
- **Bypass of Permissions:**  Users with restricted permissions could access data they were not authorized to view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to potential confidentiality breaches.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not a direct privilege escalation in the traditional sense, users could gain access to data they would not normally be permitted to see.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Index Aliases:** Exploitation occurs through operations performed against index aliases.
- **Specifically Crafted Queries:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting specific queries against an index alias that are not properly restricted by DLS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Existing User Account:** The attacker must have an existing user account with some level of access to Elasticsearch.
- **Knowledge of Index Structure:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the index and how DLS is intended to function.
- **Ability to Execute Queries:** The attacker needs to be able to execute search queries against the affected index aliases.

**Additional Details**
- The issue is present in X-Pack Security versions 5.0.0 to 5.4.0.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading to X-Pack 5.4.1 or 5.3.3, or by disabling the shard request cache for affected indices.
- The shard request cache is involved in the vulnerability, as disabling it mitigates the issue.
