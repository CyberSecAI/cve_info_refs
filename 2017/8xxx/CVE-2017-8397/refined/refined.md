The provided content relates to CVE-2017-8397.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in `objdump` when processing a corrupt binary containing relocations with negative addresses. The issue occurs because `bfd_perform_relocation` does not check for negative addresses in relocations, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow vulnerability due to missing check for negative relocation addresses.
- Out-of-bounds read and write during relocation processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service due to crashes from the heap buffer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted binary file with negative relocation addresses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a malicious binary file.
- Entice a user to process the malicious binary with `objdump`.
