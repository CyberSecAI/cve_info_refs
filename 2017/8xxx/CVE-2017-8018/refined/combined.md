ESA-2017-115: EMC AppSync Host Plug-in Denial of Service Vulnerability

EMC Identifier: ESA-2017-115
CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-8018
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

Affected products:
EMC AppSync host plug-in versions 3.5 and below (Windows platform only)

Summary:
EMC AppSync host plug-in on Windows platform includes a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that could potentially be
exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system.

Details:
EMC AppSync Host Plug-in (AppSync agent) on Windows platforms may be vulnerable when processing a large amount of
network packets. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specifically crafted packets to the vulnerable service
(port 10004) and cause denial of service situation.

Resolution:
*       Upgrade to EMC AppSync Host Plug-in version 3.1 followed by deploying Host Plug-in patch version 3.1.0.3 on top
of 3.1
*       Upgrade to EMC AppSync Host Plug-in version 3.5 followed by deploying with AppSync security update for Windows
Host Plug-in Denial of Service Vulnerability Hot Fix at location on top of 3.5
EMC recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.

Customers are advised to follow security best practices and block all traffic to AppSync agents by default and
explicitly allow only specific traffic from known AppSync servers. This strategy provides good control over the traffic
and helps minimize the attack surface. See EMC AppSync Security Configuration Guide for more information.

EMC would like to thank Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs for reporting this vulnerability.
