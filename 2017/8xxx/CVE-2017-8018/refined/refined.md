- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The EMC AppSync Host Plug-in on Windows platforms is vulnerable when processing a large amount of network packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to the improper handling of large amounts of network packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service situation by sending specifically crafted packets to the vulnerable service.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specifically crafted packets to the vulnerable service (port 10004).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service on port 10004. No authentication is required.
