Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8779:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from multiple sources, including Red Hat bugzilla, Red Hat Security Advisories, Debian Security Advisory, and the NetApp security advisory, explicitly mentions CVE-2017-8779. These sources confirm that this CVE is related to a memory leak vulnerability in `libtirpc` (and sometimes `libntirpc`) used by `rpcbind` and other programs. Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2017-8779.

**2. Extraction of Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause is an improper memory management in `libtirpc` and `libntirpc` when parsing specially crafted XDR (External Data Representation) strings or byte arrays, leading to a memory leak if parsing fails. Additionally, rpcbind is reported to use the library incorrectly and may fail to free allocated memory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   Memory leak in `libtirpc`/`libntirpc` when parsing invalid XDR messages. Specifically, if XDR parsing fails, allocated memory is not freed.
    *   `rpcbind` incorrectly specifies a maximum message length of `UINT_MAX` instead of `RPC_MAXDATASIZE`.
    *   `rpcbind` may fail to call the `svc_freeargs()` function when `svc_getargs()` fails.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion.
    *   If the memory overcommit setting is off, the affected process can be terminated by the operating system.
    *   The attack can be tweaked to consume the entire address space of the rpcbind process, making it incapable of handling legitimate requests
    *   On 32-bit systems, the address space can be exhausted faster than on 64-bit systems.
    *   A similar, but less efficient attack, may be possible against NFS, which uses XDR parsing in the kernel.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   Remote attackers can send specially crafted UDP packets to port 111 (rpcbind).
    *  An attacker able to run 'showmount -e' could potentially attack an NFS server.
*  **Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *  A remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
    *  Basic network access to the target's port 111 is required.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is described as easily exploitable with a small (approximately 60 byte) UDP packet.
*  The vulnerability is also referred to as "rpcbomb" due to the nature of the attack.
*   The issue was discovered by Guido Vranken.
*   Patches for both `libtirpc`/`libntirpc` and `rpcbind` are recommended for complete remediation. The patch for `libtirpc`/`libntirpc` addresses the core memory leak, while the patch for `rpcbind` addresses its incorrect use of the library.
*   Mitigation involves rate-limiting via iptables and enforcing memory limits on the rpcbind service.
*   Some sources mention that the issue was initially fixed (in a patch which ended up crashing rpcbind) and then subsequently fixed again.

**4. Summary of extracted information:**

The vulnerability, known as rpcbomb (CVE-2017-8779), stems from a memory leak in `libtirpc`/`libntirpc` when processing malformed XDR strings, and `rpcbind`'s improper usage of the library. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted UDP packets to port 111, leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service. Patches for both the library and `rpcbind` are necessary to mitigate the vulnerability fully.
