Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `t1_decoder_parse_charstrings` function in `src/psaux/t1decode.c` of the FreeType library. Specifically, the issue is in how the code handles 'flex' operators within Type 1 fonts. Malformed fonts can call arbitrary operators after a 'flex' operator has begun, which could lead to adding extra points without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Bounds Checking:** The code doesn't adequately check if there's sufficient space to add a new point when processing 'flex' operators. It increments `num_flex_vectors` without verifying if more points can be added, based on the outline buffer size and existing points.
- **Type Confusion/Logic Error:** The `callothersubr` instruction doesn't behave as a single flex operator but calls a series of subroutines which could execute arbitrary operations, which can bypass the intended check on 'flex' instruction and add more points to outline.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By providing a maliciously crafted font file, an attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the FreeType library.
- **Denial of Service:** If the code doesn't crash outright, it might lead to a denial of service condition due to memory corruption and/or excessive resource consumption when processing the crafted font.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Font File:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted font file that exploits the vulnerability in the 'flex' operator handling within the Type 1 font parsing logic.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice the user to open or use this malformed font file. This could happen through a website embedding a malicious font, an email attachment containing the font, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious font file that triggers the vulnerability.
- They require a way to deliver this font file to the victim, and that the application using FreeType would attempt to process it.
- The attacker would need some understanding of the internal workings of the FreeType library's Type 1 font handling logic, particularly the 'flex' operator processing.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding checks to ensure there is enough space in the outline buffer before adding a point in the 'flex' operator handler.
- The provided git commit log shows the exact lines of code changed to address the vulnerability.
- The Debian security advisory DSA-3839-1 confirms that this CVE has been addressed in the stable distribution.
- The Gentoo security advisory GLSA 201706-14 includes CVE-2017-8105.
