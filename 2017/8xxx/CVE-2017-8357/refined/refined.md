Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8357:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ReadEPTImage` function in the `ept.c` file of ImageMagick.
*   The code has memory management issues, specifically a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The `ReadEPTImage` function allocates memory but fails to free it in certain cases, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly triggering the memory leak can exhaust available memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted EPT File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted EPT file to ImageMagick for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted EPT file to a system using a vulnerable version of ImageMagick.
*   No specific privileges are explicitly mentioned, so it's likely exploitable by any user who can submit files to ImageMagick.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided GitHub issue #453 contains a stack trace showing the allocation and the location of the leak
*   A test case is provided in the GitHub issue, demonstrating the crafted EPT file that triggers the leak.
*   Debian Security Advisory DSA-3863-1 confirms that CVE-2017-8357 is a memory handling problem within ImageMagick that can lead to DoS
