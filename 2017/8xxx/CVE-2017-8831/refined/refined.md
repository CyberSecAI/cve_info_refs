Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8831:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `saa7164` video capture driver in the Linux kernel re-reads data from a PCI device after validating it. This double-fetch of data could lead to inconsistencies if the data changes between the first read and the second read, potentially causing a use-after-free or other memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition:** The core issue is a race condition where data fetched from the device can change between two reads.
- **Double fetch:** The driver reads data from the device twice without ensuring consistency between the reads.
- **Lack of validation after second fetch:** The driver does not validate the data fetched in the second read against the conditions checked during the first read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** A physically present user could exploit this vulnerability to achieve privilege escalation.
- **Denial of service (system crash):** The vulnerability could also be exploited to cause a system crash.
- **Memory corruption**: If the size or sequence number of the fetched message changes between reads, it could lead to memory access related issues, such as out-of-bounds access.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Physical access:** An attacker needs physical access to the system to attach a specially designed PCI device.
- **Malicious PCI device:** The attacker needs to be able to control the response from a connected PCI device in order to manipulate the data returned between the two fetches.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Physical proximity:**  The attacker must be physically present to connect a malicious PCI device.
- **Hardware manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious PCI device that can alter the data returned on subsequent reads.

**Additional technical details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `saa7164_bus_get` function in `drivers/media/pci/saa7164/saa7164-bus.c`.
- The function first fetches data into `msg_tmp`, performs validation, and then fetches the data again into `msg` without re-validation.
- The `seqno` field of the message, which is used to access an array, is susceptible to modification between reads leading to an array out of bounds access.
- The fix involves ensuring that the second fetch of the message is consistent with the first by reusing the values from the first transfer.
- A patch was created to address the double fetch issue by re-using the data from the initial fetch, rather than fetching it again from the PCI device.
- The patch avoids a double fetch by reusing the values from the prior transfer.
- The vulnerability was originally reported in Linux kernel 4.10.1.
- A fix for this vulnerability was included in Debian LTS security update DLA-1200-1.

The information provided from the multiple sources gives a clear picture of the vulnerability, its causes, how it can be exploited, and the fix that was implemented.
