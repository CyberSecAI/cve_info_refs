  "CVE-2017-8759": {
    "description": "The Microsoft .NET Framework has a code injection vulnerability in the System.Runtime.Remoting component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document or application that contains an embedded WSDL file with a malicious URL that contains a CRLF character sequence. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `IsValidUrl` method within the `WsdlParser` class of `System.Runtime.Remoting`. This method fails to properly sanitize URLs, particularly by not checking for CRLF characters. Before the patch, the method directly uses the unsanitized URL in the generated C# file, causing code injection when the URL contains `\\r\\n`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Code injection due to lack of CRLF sanitization in WSDL URL parsing.",
      "Failure to properly encode special characters in URLs when generating C# code from WSDL files."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This is achieved by injecting malicious code into the generated C# file during WSDL processing, which is then compiled and executed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploitation through specially crafted RTF documents containing a malicious URL. This can be triggered when the document is opened and the WSDL file is processed.",
        "Exploitation via crafted PPSX files using OLE object and a SOAP moniker.",
        "Exploitation through specially crafted CSV files that contain a formula using a SOAP moniker."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create documents (RTF, PPSX, CSV), or a malicious webserver hosting the files, that contain a crafted WSDL file with a malicious URL, and convince the victim to open them. The attacker also needs to host the malicious payload.",
    "notes": "The vulnerability can be exploited in various Microsoft Office applications, including Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, as the core vulnerability is in the .NET Framework. The vulnerability can be triggered using OLE object and monikers (URL, SOAP, script). The patch for this CVE implements a new method called `TransliterateString` that encodes non-alphabetic characters, preventing CRLF injection, unless an application setting is specifically set to allow unsanitized URLs."
