The provided content is related to CVE-2017-8857.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 'bprd' process on a NetBackup master server allows an unauthenticated user to copy any file to any other file on any NetBackup host in the master server domain.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated file copy vulnerability.
- Ability to overwrite files on any NetBackup host within the master server domain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file copy allows an attacker to copy malicious executable to a target system.
- Combined with the ability to execute the copied file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary remote command execution as root/administrator.
- Full compromise of affected NetBackup master servers and potentially connected media servers and clients.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Unauthenticated user can send malicious requests to the vulnerable 'bprd' process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the 'bprd' process on a NetBackup master server.
- No authentication is required.
