{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `win32k!NtGdiGetGlyphOutline` system call handler allocates memory with a user-controlled size, then fills it with outline data via `win32k!GreGetGlyphOutlineInternal`. If the data written is smaller than the allocated memory, the remaining part remains uninitialized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure due to uninitialized memory being copied to user-mode.",
      "Lack of proper memory initialization after allocation."
    ],
    "impact": "Disclosure of arbitrary kernel memory, potentially leading to the defeat of exploit mitigations (kernel ASLR) or the exposure of secrets stored in kernel address space.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Triggering the `NtGdiGetGlyphOutline` system call via the `GetGlyphOutline()` API."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Local authenticated user capable of calling Win32 API."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists on Windows 7 and 8, but was fixed in Windows 10 by adding a `memset()` call to pad the memory area with zeros, preventing information disclosure. The `win32k!AllocFreeTmpBuffer` routine attempts to return a static block of 4096 bytes for optimization; otherwise, it makes a pool allocation."
