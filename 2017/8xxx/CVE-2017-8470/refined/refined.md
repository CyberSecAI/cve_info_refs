{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Windows handles logical font structures (LOGFONT). When creating a logical font using functions like CreateFont() or CreateFontIndirect(), the lfFaceName field within the LOGFONT structure, a 32-character array for the typeface name, is not fully initialized. This means that the trailing bytes of this array, beyond the actual font name, can contain remnants of kernel stack data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory: The lfFaceName field of the LOGFONT structure is not completely initialized, leading to the presence of leftover kernel stack data.",
       "Information Disclosure: The uninitialized portion of the LOGFONT structure, containing kernel stack data, can be read by user-mode applications through the `GetObject()` function."
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability allows a local attacker to disclose portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory, which can include kernel pointers and other sensitive information. This information can be used to bypass Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (kASLR) and may potentially lead to further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a local user-mode application creating a logical font and then using the `GetObject()` function to retrieve the LOGFONT structure. By examining the uninitialized portions of the structure, an attacker can leak kernel stack memory.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code locally on the target system. They also need to be able to use the GDI API functions (e.g., CreateFont, GetObject)."
