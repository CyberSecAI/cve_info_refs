**Vulnerable App:**

```
/*
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1178

We have discovered that it is possible to disclose portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory in Windows 7-10 through the win32k!NtGdiExtGetObjectW system call (accessible via a documented GetObject() API function) to user-mode applications.

The reason for this seems to be as follows: logical fonts in Windows are described by the LOGFONT structure [1]. One of the structure's fields is lfFaceName, a 32-character array containing the typeface name. Usually when logical fonts are created (e.g. with the CreateFont() or CreateFontIndirect() user-mode functions), a large part of the array remains uninitialized, as most font names are shorter than the maximum length. For instance, the CreateFont() API only copies the relevant string up until \0, and leaves the rest of its local LOGFONT structure untouched. In case of CreateFontIndirect(), it is mostly up to the caller to make sure there are no leftover bytes in the structure, but we expect this is rarely paid attention to. The structure is then copied to kernel-mode address space, but can be read back using the GetObject() function, provided that the program has a GDI handle to the logical font.

Now, it turns out that the trailing, uninitialized bytes of the LOGFONT structure for some of the stock fonts contain left-over kernel stack data, which include kernel pointers, among other potentially interesting information. An example output of the attached proof-of-concept program (which obtains and displays the LOGFONT of the DEVICE_DEFAULT_FONT stock font) started on Windows 7 32-bit is as follows:

--- cut ---
00000000: 10 00 00 00 07 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
00000010: bc 02 00 00 00 00 00 ee 01 02 02 22 53 00 79 00 ..........."S.y.
00000020: 73 00 74 00 65 00 6d 00 00 00 29 92 24 86 6d 81 s.t.e.m...).$.m.
00000030: fb 4d f2 ad fe ff ff ff 63 76 86 81 76 79 86 81 .M......cv..vy..
00000040: 10 38 c7 94 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 .8..............
00000050: d0 03 69 81 10 38 c7 94 04 7a 00 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? ..i..8...z......
--- cut ---

After the "System" unicode string, we can observe data typical to a function stack frame: a _EH3_EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION structure at offset 0x28:

.Next             = 0x9229???? (truncated)
.ExceptionHandler = 0x816d8624
.ScopeTable       = 0xadf24dfb
.TryLevel         = 0xfffffffe

as well as pointers to the ntoskrnl.exe kernel image (0x81867663, 0x81867976, 0x816903d0) and paged pool (0x94c73810). This information is largely useful for local attackers seeking to defeat the kASLR exploit mitigation, and the bug might also allow disclosing other sensitive data stored in the kernel address space. We have confirmed that more data can be easily leaked by querying other stock fonts. It is unclear whether disclosing junk stack data from other user-mode processes which create logical fonts is possible, but this scenario should also be investigated and addressed if necessary.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
