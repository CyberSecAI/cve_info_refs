{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization in the `report_error.php` script. The value of the `year1` parameter obtained from the GET request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or denial-of-service attacks, and can lead to code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted GET request to the `report_error.php` endpoint, with a malicious payload in the `year` parameter, which is then used in SQL query.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable Accellion FTA server."
