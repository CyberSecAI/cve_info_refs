The provided content describes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in MikroTik RouterBoard v6.38.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the software's inability to properly handle a flood of UDP packets on port 500 (used for L2TP over IPsec).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The software is susceptible to resource exhaustion when flooded with UDP packets.
- Lack of proper rate-limiting or input validation for UDP packets on port 500.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The router becomes unresponsive, preventing new connections.
- Existing devices are disconnected from the router.
- System logs are automatically removed.
- The router may reboot due to watchdog timer.
- 100% CPU usage on all cores is observed during the attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a flood of UDP packets to the affected router on port 500.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the targeted router.
- No user account or user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote.

The vulnerability is demonstrated with the following `hping3` command:
```
hping3 --udp -p 6000 --destport 500 --flood [router's IP]
```
This command sends a flood of UDP packets to the target router's IP address on destination port 500.
