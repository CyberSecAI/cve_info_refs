- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The driver of some Huawei smartphones has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to a lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to system reboot or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious app with root privileges. This app then sends a specific, malicious parameter to the vulnerable driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application.
    - The malicious application requires root privileges on the Android system.
    - The attacker needs to know the specific parameter required to trigger the vulnerability in the driver.
