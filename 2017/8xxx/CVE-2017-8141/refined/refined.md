Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory double free vulnerability present in the Touch Panel (TP) driver of certain Huawei smartphones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to free the same memory location twice within the TP driver. This double free can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** Exploiting the double free can lead to the system crashing.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability may also allow for arbitrary code execution on the affected device, potentially granting the attacker further control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** The attack requires a malicious application to be installed on the device.
- **Multiple Threads:** The application exploits the vulnerability by creating multiple threads that attempt to free specific memory locations within the TP driver.
- **User Interaction:** The user must be tricked into installing the malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Root Privilege:** The attacker needs to have root privileges on the Android system of the target device. This suggests the attacker might already have compromised the device or used an exploit to gain root access.
- **Malicious Application Installation:** The attacker needs to successfully trick the user into installing a malicious application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Yonggang Guo of IceSword Lab, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd.
- Huawei released a software update to fix the vulnerability.
- The CVSSv3 base score is 6.5 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The specific affected product and resolved version is for the P10 Plus: Versions earlier than VKY-AL00C00B153 are affected, and VKY-AL00C00B153 resolves it.
