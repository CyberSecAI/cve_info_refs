Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities fixed in wolfSSL version 3.11.0, some of which are likely candidates for CVE-2017-8855:

**Vulnerabilities Fixed in wolfSSL 3.11.0:**

1.  **Out-of-bounds memory access in `wc_DhParamsLoad()`:**
    *   **Root cause:**  The function `wc_DhParamsLoad()` could read out of bounds memory if `GetLength()` returns zero.
    *   **Weakness:**  Improper bounds checking when handling lengths in the `wc_DhParamsLoad` function.
    *   **Impact:**  Out-of-bounds read can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially information disclosure.
    *   **Attack vector:** Exploitable through crafted inputs leading to `GetLength()` returning zero when processing Diffie-Hellman parameters.
    *   **Required capabilities:** An attacker capable of manipulating/providing DH parameters during a handshake.

2.  **Malformed DH key accepted by `wc_DhAgree`:**
    *   **Root cause:** The function `wc_DhAgree` would accept a malformed DH key.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of Diffie-Hellman keys before agreement.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential compromise of session keys, leading to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Attack vector:** Exploitable by providing a malformed DH key during the key exchange process.
    *   **Required capabilities:** An attacker positioned in a network path to manipulate or inject a crafted DH key.

3.  **Double free in CA certificate handling:**
    *   **Root cause:** A double free could occur when adding a CA certificate into the `X509_store`.
    *   **Weakness:**  Memory management error when handling CA certificates.
    *   **Impact:** Potential crash or denial of service.
    *   **Attack vector:** Triggerable when adding a specially crafted CA certificate.
    *    **Required capabilities:** An attacker who can influence which CA certificate will be added to the X509 store.

4.  **Memory management issue with static memory enabled:**
    *   **Root cause:** A memory management issue when the static memory feature is enabled. This feature is disabled by default.
    *   **Weakness:**  Improper memory management when using static memory.
    *   **Impact:** Potential heap corruption or other unexpected memory related issues.
     *   **Attack vector:** Exploitable through usage of static memory allocation with specific configurations
    *    **Required capabilities:** Requires specific use of static memory allocation, not a default feature.

5.  **Out-of-bounds write in `wolfSSL_X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID`:**
    *   **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds write can occur in `wolfSSL_X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID`. This function is not used in TLS or crypto operations, but can be called explicitly by an application.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper bounds checking in the function.
    *   **Impact:**  Buffer overflow. Potential code execution.
     *   **Attack vector:** Exploitable through explicit call to the function with crafted input.
    *    **Required capabilities:** Requires the application to make an explicit call to this function with a crafted input.

6.  **Improper signature check on peer certificates:**
    *   **Root cause:** In versions 3.9.10, 3.10.0, and 3.10.2, a corrupted signature on a peer certificate would not be flagged properly.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate validation of peer certificate signatures.
    *   **Impact:**  The library may accept a malicious certificate, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks or other forms of compromise.
    *   **Attack vector:** Exploitable by presenting a peer certificate with a corrupted signature.
    *   **Required capabilities:** Ability to control the peer certificate during the TLS handshake.

**Summary of relevant information for CVE-2017-8855:**

While the document doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2017-8855, it details several security vulnerabilities patched in wolfSSL version 3.11.0. The most relevant of these for a potential CVE assignment would be:
