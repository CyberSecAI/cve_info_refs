**X-Pack 5.4.1 privilege escalation (ESA-2017-06)**

X-Pack 5.4.1 has been released which fixes a privilege escalation bug in the run\_as functionality. This bug prevents transitioning into the specified user specified in a run\_as request. If a role has been created using a template that contains the \_user properties, the behavior of run\_as will be incorrect. Additionally if the run\_as user specified does not exist, the transition will not happen.

Generally when using the run as functionality a user will transition to a different user. This bug will cause the role query to execute as the user which authenticated to Elasticsearch, not the user specified via run as. This could result in a query returning incorrect or unexpected results.

If you are not using run\_as functionality or the \_user properties you are not affected by this issue.

**Affected versions**

X-Pack Security 5.0.0 to 5.4.0 is affected by this flaw

**Solution and Mitigations**

If you are affected by this issue, we suggest you upgrade your Elastic Stack to version 5.4.1

If you are unable to upgrade, removing use of the {{\_user.username}} placeholder and ensuring the run\_as setting cannot be modified by untrusted users is a valid solution.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8438

---

**Kibana 5.4.1 Cross Site Scripting (ESA-2017-07)**

Kibana 5.4.1 has been released which fixes a cross site scripting bug in the Time Series Visual Builder. This bug could allow an attacker to construct a visualization in such a way that when viewed by another Kibana user could leak sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of the Kibana user.

**Affected versions**

Kibana 5.4.0 is affected by this flaw

**Solution and Mitigations**

We strongly advise users to update to Kibana version 5.4.1.

If you are unable to upgrade at this time, the Time Series Visual Builder can be disabled by adding ‘metrics.enabled: false’ to your kibana.yml configuration file. Note that this will trigger an optimize cycle when you next start Kibana.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8439

---

**Kibana 5.4.1 and 5.3.3 Cross Site Scripting (ESA-2017-08)**

Kibana 5.4.1 and 5.3.3 have been released which fix a cross site scripting bug in the Discover page. An attacker who is able to insert arbitrary data into elasticsearch that when viewed by another Kibana user on the Discover page could leak sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of the Kibana user.

**Affected versions**

Kibana versions between 5.3.0 and 5.4.0 are affected by this flaw

**Solution and Mitigations**

We strongly advise users to update to Kibana version 5.4.1 or 5.3.3.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8440

Elastic would like to thank Thomas Gøytil for reporting this issue.

**X-Pack 5.4.1 and 5.3.3 improper DLS alias enforcement (ESA-2017-09)**

X-Pack 5.4.1 and 5.3.3 have been released with a fix for a bug in the way Document Level Security is applied to index aliases. This bug could allow a user with restricted permissions to view data they should not have access to when performing certain operations against an index alias.

**Affected versions**

X-Pack Security 5.0.0 to 5.4.0 is affected by this flaw

**Solution and Mitigations**

If you are affected by this issue, we suggest you upgrade your Elastic Stack to version 5.4.1 or 5.3.3.

If you are unable to upgrade, the shard request cache can be disabled for indices that use aliases. Instructions to disable the request cache can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/shard-request-cache.html#_enabling_and_disabling_caching)

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8441

# Elasticsearch 5.4.1 and 5.3.3 released

Today we are pleased to announce bug fix releases of **Elasticsearch 5.4.1**, based on **Lucene 6.5.1**, and **Elasticsearch 5.3.3**, based on **Lucene 6.4.2**. Elasticsearch 5.4.1 is the latest stable release, and is already available for deployment on [Elastic Cloud](/cloud), our Elasticsearch-as-a-service platform. This release includes two security bug fixes — all users of X-Pack Security should upgrade.

Latest stable release in 5.x:

* [Download Elasticsearch 5.4.1](/downloads/elasticsearch)
* [Elasticsearch 5.4.1 release notes](/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/release-notes-5.4.1.html)
* [Elasticsearch 5.4 breaking changes](/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/breaking-changes-5.4.html)
* [X-Pack 5.4.1 release notes](/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-release-notes.html#xpack-5.4.1)

Bugfix release in 5.3:

* [Download Elasticsearch 5.3.3](/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-5-3-3)
* [Elasticsearch 5.3.3 release notes](/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/release-notes-5.3.3.html)
* [Elasticsearch 5.3 breaking changes](/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/breaking-changes-5.3.html)
* [X-Pack 5.3.3 release notes](/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-release-notes.html#xpack-5.3.3)

You can read about all the changes in the release notes linked above, but there are a few changes which are worth highlighting below.

## X-Pack Document Level Security and Aliases (ESA-2017-09)

X-Pack Security versions prior to 5.4.1 and 5.3.3 did not always correctly apply Document Level Security to index aliases. This bug could allow a user with restricted permissions to view data they should not have access to when performing certain operations against an index alias.

### Affected versions

X-Pack Security 5.0.0 to 5.4.0 is affected by this flaw.

### Solution and Mitigations

All users of X-Pack security should upgrade to version 5.3.3 or 5.4.1. If you cannot upgrade, [disabling the request cache](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/shard-request-cache.html#_enabling_and_disabling_caching) on the index will mitigate this bug.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8441

## X-Pack Privilege Escalation (ESA-2017-06)

This release fixes a privilege escalation bug in the `run_as` functionality. This bug prevents transitioning into the specified user specified in a `run_as` request. If a role has been created using a template that contains any of the `_user` properties, the behavior of `run_as` will be incorrect. Additionally if the `run_as` user specified does not exist, the transition will not happen.

Generally when using the `run_as` functionality a user will transition to a different user. This bug will cause the role query to execute as the user which authenticated to Elasticsearch, not the user specified via `run_as`. This could result in a query returning incorrect or unexpected results.

If you are not using `run_as` functionality or the `_user` properties you are not affected by this issue.

### Affected versions

X-Pack Security 5.0.0 to 5.4.0 is affected by this flaw.

### Solution and Mitigations

If you are affected by this issue, we suggest you upgrade your Elastic Stack to version 5.4.1 If you are unable to upgrade, removing use of the `{{_user.username}}` placeholder and ensuring the `run_as` setting cannot be modified by untrusted users is a valid solution.

**CVE ID****:** CVE-2017-8438

## Other important changes

* A bug with single-shard scroll could result in X-Pack Security causing a node to die with OOM.
* Elasticsearch 5.4.0 with TLS enabled could not authenticate nodes from 5.3.x and before.
* Authenticated LDAP users could remain cached after their authentication had been revoked.
* Netty now respects the `processors` setting when sizing thread pools, buffer pools, and other resources, instead of potentially oversizing these resources when running on a node with other containers.
* Index setting updates on a closed index are now validated, to protect users from creating bad settings which may prevent the index from being reopened.
* Bugs have been fixed in the sniffing protocol of the transport client which could result in the client hanging.
* The HDFS repository plugin in `KERBEROS` security mode clashed with the Java Security Manager.
* Snapshot/restore retrieval of all snapshots in Elasticsearch 5.2.x and above was very slow.

# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).
