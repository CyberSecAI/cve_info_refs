Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-8438:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A privilege escalation bug exists in the `run_as` functionality of X-Pack Security.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `run_as` functionality fails to transition to the specified user.
- If a role is created using a template with `_user` properties, the `run_as` behavior will be incorrect.
- If the `run_as` user does not exist, the transition will not occur.
- The role query is executed as the authenticated user instead of the user specified via `run_as`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can cause a query to return incorrect or unexpected results.
-  A user might be able to view or modify data they should not have access to if the query is executed with the authenticated user's privileges rather than the intended `run_as` user.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user could exploit this vulnerability by using the `run_as` functionality with roles created using templates containing `_user` properties or by specifying a non-existent user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Elasticsearch and must have the ability to utilize the `run_as` feature.

**Affected versions:**
- X-Pack Security 5.0.0 to 5.4.0 are affected by this flaw.

**Solution and Mitigations**
- Upgrade to Elastic Stack version 5.4.1
- If upgrading is not possible, remove use of the `{{_user.username}}` placeholder, and ensure the `run_as` setting cannot be modified by untrusted users.
