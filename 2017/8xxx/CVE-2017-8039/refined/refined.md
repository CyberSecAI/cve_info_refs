- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Malicious Expression Language (EL) expressions can be injected into view states that process form submissions, leading to remote code execution. This occurs when the `MvcViewFactoryCreator useSpringBinding` property is not explicitly set to `true` (it is `false` by default) and the view state does not have a `<binder>` sub-element to declare explicit data binding property mappings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted data binding with EL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious EL expressions via form submissions.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted form submission to a vulnerable view state.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application and target a vulnerable form submission endpoint.
