Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-8812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how MediaWiki handles `id` attributes within headlines. Specifically, the software was not properly sanitizing or escaping the `>` character within headline `id` attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core issue is that the software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when generating `id` attributes for headlines, allowing raw `>` characters to be included.
- **HTML Injection**: By including raw `>` characters in the `id` attribute, it becomes possible to potentially inject arbitrary HTML code or manipulate existing HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **HTML Mutilation**: An attacker could inject a `>` character within the `id` attribute, which could lead to unexpected formatting or break the intended structure of the webpage. This could be used for cosmetic changes or disrupt the user experience.
- **Potential XSS:** Although not explicitly mentioned as a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the description, the ability to inject raw characters in attributes could be a potential vector to deliver malicious scripts under certain conditions, if combined with other weaknesses. However, this requires the specific context to be suitable for such attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Headline Manipulation:** An attacker could include a `>` character when creating or editing a page headline, where the headline text is used to generate the `id` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Content Creation/Editing Access:** The attacker would need the ability to create or edit page content, specifically headlines, on the affected MediaWiki instance.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-8812 is a vulnerability within MediaWiki that arises from the improper handling of `>` characters in headline `id` attributes.  This allows an attacker who can edit page content to inject a raw `>` character in the `id` attribute, leading to potential HTML mutilation, and in some cases, potentially opening the door for XSS. The primary attack vector involves manipulating the headline content when creating or editing a page.
