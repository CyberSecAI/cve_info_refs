{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A type confusion vulnerability occurs in Microsoft Edge when processing CSS styles.",
    "weaknesses": "The vulnerability stems from a type confusion within the `CssParser::RecordProperty` function. Specifically, a `CAttrArray` object is expected, but a `CAttribute` object is received, leading to incorrect memory operations.",
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition due to an access violation. It is also possible that the type confusion could lead to more serious consequences such as arbitrary code execution, but this is not explicitly detailed.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is triggered by crafting a malicious HTML page that manipulates the `cssText` property of an element's style, specifically using `clip-path` with a `url()` reference. This causes the incorrect type to be passed to the vulnerable function.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to serve or have the victim load a malicious webpage. The vulnerability is triggered within the browser when processing the crafted CSS."
