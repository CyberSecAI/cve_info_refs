Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-8787:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer over-read in the `PoDoFo::PdfXRefStreamParserObject::ReadXRefStreamEntry` function. This function reads data from a buffer based on calculated offsets. The offsets are derived from a 'W' array in the PDF file, specifically from values read from a PDF stream representing cross-reference (xref) data. The code calculates `entryLen` using  `nW[0] + nW[1] + nW[2]`. If the values in the 'W' array lead to a large `entryLen` (e.g., when adding negative values), a subsequent increment of the buffer pointer `pBuffer` by  `entryLen` in a loop can cause the pointer to wrap around due to integer overflow, resulting in reading data from an out-of-bounds memory location within the heap, specifically when the ReadXRefStreamEntry function is called later in the loop, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The primary vulnerability is an attempt to read data from memory outside the allocated buffer on the heap.
*   **Integer Overflow:** The lack of validation or sanitization of the values read from the 'W' array allows for integer overflow during `entryLen` calculation, which is then used to increment a pointer, resulting in memory corruption.
*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The code does not validate or sanitize the values from the 'W' array read from the file and does not check if the buffer is still valid after multiple pointer arithmetic operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a crash due to a heap-based buffer over-read, effectively causing a denial of service. This can be triggered when the program tries to parse a malicious PDF file, and the PDF parsing application/library will terminate.

*   **Unspecified Impact:** The CVE description mentions a "possibly have unspecified other impact". This suggests there might be other potential effects, possibly information disclosure or further code execution if the attacker can precisely control the overflow to overwrite other data structures in memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PDF File:** The attack vector involves a maliciously crafted PDF file. This file contains specific values in the 'W' array within the xref stream dictionary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered by simply opening a malicious PDF file.
*   **Crafting a malicious PDF file:** The attacker must be able to craft or modify a PDF file to include the specific 'W' array values which causes integer overflow and subsequently a heap-based out-of-bounds read.
