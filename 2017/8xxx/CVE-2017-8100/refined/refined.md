Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential CVE-2017-8100:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress CopySafe Web plugin version < 2.6 lacks sufficient CSRF protection when handling plugin settings updates.
*   **Weakness:** The plugin doesn't properly validate the origin of the request when modifying its settings.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly making changes to the plugin's settings.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to the plugin's settings page (`wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpcsw_settings`). This form contains pre-filled values for the settings the attacker wants to change (e.g., `admin_only`, `asps`, `upload_path`, `max_size`, `mode`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage or inject HTML into a site that a logged-in WordPress administrator is likely to visit. The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress server.
*   **POC:** The provided HTML form demonstrates how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability. When a logged-in administrator visits this page and the form is submitted (either automatically or by tricking the admin to click submit), the plugin settings are modified to the values specified in the form.
*   **Mitigation:** The reporter suggests disabling the plugin until a fixed version is released. Version 2.6 addresses this vulnerability.
