{
  "Root cause": "The IOCTL sent to the \\Device\\KsecDD device by the BCryptOpenAlgorithmProvider documented API returns some uninitialized pool memory in the output buffer.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Information Disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact": "Local authenticated attackers can defeat certain exploit mitigations (kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specific IOCTL to the \\Device\\KsecDD device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Local authenticated access to the system."
