{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A type confusion vulnerability exists in the `JavascriptArray::ConcatArgs` function within the Chakra JavaScript engine. The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect handling of spreadable items during array concatenation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Type confusion in JavascriptArray::ConcatArgs. When a non-spreadable item is encountered after a spreadable item, the code incorrectly sets a 'spreadable' flag to true, leading to type confusion when the non-spreadable item is later treated as a spreadable array.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS). The type confusion leads to an attempt to access an object as if it were an array which causes a crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a JavaScript array concatenation operation (`concat`) with specific arguments. The attacker needs to use a getter on an object to modify the arguments at runtime.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable application using the Chakra engine. Specifically, the attacker needs to control the arguments of an array concatenation operation.",
   "Additional Information": "The vulnerability occurs specifically in the `JavascriptArray::ConcatArgs` function when the `firstPromotedItemIsSpreadable` flag is set and the following items in the arguments are modified via a getter. This causes a type confusion when a non-spreadable argument is later treated as a spreadable array."
