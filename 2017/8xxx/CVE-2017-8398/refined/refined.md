Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow in the `printf_common` function within the binutils library, specifically when processing DWARF debug information. The root cause is the assumption that strings extracted from a section are null-terminated, which is not always the case in corrupt or maliciously crafted binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The `printf_common` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing a non-null-terminated string extracted from a DWARF section.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't properly validate or handle strings extracted from the debug information sections, leading to the overflow. Specifically, the functions `process_extended_line_op`, `fetch_indirect_string`, `fetch_indirect_line_string`, and `fetch_indexed_string` are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash due to memory corruption. This can be triggered by processing specially crafted ELF files, PE files, or other binary files with malicious DWARF debug information.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, a heap buffer overflow can potentially be leveraged for more serious attacks, such as arbitrary code execution, under specific circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Binary Files:** An attacker can create malicious ELF, PE, or other binary files with crafted DWARF debug information to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious Binaries:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious binaries with specific DWARF debug information.
- **Entice User to Process the Binary:** The attacker must entice a user to use affected binutils tools (like `objdump` or `readelf`) to process the malicious binary.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was identified through AddressSanitizer (ASAN) and Valgrind during testing with a directed version of AFL (AFLGo).
- The vulnerable code is located in `dwarf.c`.
- The fix involves ensuring that strings extracted from DWARF sections are not assumed to be null-terminated and returning error messages when strings lack null termination.
- The bug was found in `binutils` version 2.28.
- The provided bug report includes example input files to trigger the vulnerability.
