The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in PoDoFo, specifically within the `PoDoFo::PdfParser::ReadDocumentStructure` function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Infinite recursion between `PoDoFo::PdfParser::ReadXRefContents` and `PoDoFo::PdfParser::ReadXRefStreamContents` functions due to the way they call each other when specific conditions related to xref tables and XRefStm streams are met.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability due to unbounded recursion, eventually exhausting stack space and causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). The program crashes due to stack overflow, preventing it from processing PDF files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted PDF files that trigger the recursive calls between `ReadXRefContents` and `ReadXRefStreamContents` functions, leading to a stack overflow.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted PDF file with a specific structure involving cross-reference tables and streams.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted PDF file to a vulnerable PoDoFo-based application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is in `PdfParser.cpp` in `PoDoFo::PdfParser::ReadDocumentStructure`, `PoDoFo::PdfParser::ReadXRefContents`, and `PoDoFo::PdfParser::ReadXRefStreamContents`.
- The specific conditions for the recursion involve how "Prev" chains are handled in xref objects.
- The provided crash log and debugging backtrace show the recursive function calls before the stack overflow occurs.
- The vulnerable code is found in PoDoFo version 0.9.5.
- A sample crashing file is provided (a link to a file on google drive), which can be used to reproduce the crash.
