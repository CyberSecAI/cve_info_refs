**X-Pack alerting privileged user multiple issues**

An error was found in the permission model used by X-Pack alerting whereby users mapped to certain built-in roles could create a watch that results in that user gaining elevated privileges.

**Affected Versions:** 5.0.0 to 5.6.0

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Deployments of the Elastic Stack that utilize X-Pack alerting should be upgraded to version 5.6.1 to fix the privilege escalation issue.

Users mapped to the built-in “watcher\_admin” or “machine\_learning\_admin” roles, or any other role to which the “manage\_ml” or “manage\_watcher” cluster privilege has been assigned, should be reviewed and granted only to personnel with appropriate trust levels to read and write all indices.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8448

**Kibana Timelion Cross Site Scripting (XSS) error (ESA-2017-20)**

Kibana versions prior to 5.6.1 had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Timelion that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users.

**Affected Versions:** 5.0.0 to 5.6.0

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 5.6.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11479
