- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An error in the permission model of X-Pack alerting allowed users with specific built-in roles or those assigned the "manage_ml" or "manage_watcher" cluster privileges to create a watch that resulted in elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to incorrect permission model.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users can gain elevated privileges, potentially allowing them to read and write all indices.
- **Attack vectors:** Creation of a malicious watch by a user with the required permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Users must have been mapped to either the built-in "watcher_admin" or "machine_learning_admin" roles, or any other role to which the "manage_ml" or "manage_watcher" cluster privilege has been assigned.
