{
  "CVE-2017-8824": {
    "description": "The dccp_disconnect function in net/dccp/proto.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.3 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via an AF_UNSPEC connect system call during the DCCP_LISTEN state.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The dccp_disconnect() function in the DCCP implementation forgets to free dccps_hc_rx_ccid/dccps_hc_tx_ccid when a socket object is in DCCP_LISTEN state and connect() is being called with AF_UNSPEC. Later when connect() is called with AF_INET6 sockaddr family, a new socket object is cloned from the old one, which holds references to the same dccps_hc_rx_ccid/dccps_hc_tx_ccid. This leads to multiple socket objects using the same memory.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "A local unprivileged user can cause a denial of service (system crash), data corruption, or possibly privilege escalation by exploiting the use-after-free condition.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local"
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged attacker."
