- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Bastet driver in certain Huawei smartphones has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application with root privileges. This app then sends a crafted parameter to the Bastet driver, triggering the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to develop a malicious app, have the user install it, and obtain root privileges for the app to exploit the vulnerability.
