The provided content relates to CVE-2017-8401.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read of heap data occurs within the `png_load()` function (specifically at `lib/png.c:724` and later observed at line 736 during debugging). This is triggered by a malformed PNG file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow read.

**Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). The out-of-bounds read causes a segmentation fault, crashing the application.

**Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted PNG files are used as input to `png2swf`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed PNG file as input to the vulnerable `png2swf` application. This suggests local access to the system or the ability to influence files processed by the application are required.
