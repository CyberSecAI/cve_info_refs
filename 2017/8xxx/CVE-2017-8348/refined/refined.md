Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-8348

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ReadMATImage` function within the `mat.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, a memory leak occurs when processing a crafted MAT file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** The `ReadMATImage` function fails to properly free allocated memory when processing a malformed MAT file, leading to a memory leak.
  - The leak includes direct and indirect leaks.
  - Direct leak of 152 bytes in 1 object.
  - Indirect leaks: 361508 bytes in 4 objects, 64 bytes in 1 object, and 32 bytes in 1 object.
  - Total of 361756 bytes leaked in 7 allocations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by repeatedly triggering the memory leak, eventually exhausting available memory and causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted File:** The attack vector is a maliciously crafted MAT image file.
- The attacker would need to provide the crafted file as input to an ImageMagick process for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted MAT file to a system that uses ImageMagick to process image files.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided github issue provides a detailed call stack of the memory leak.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-3863-1) confirms the existence of the vulnerability and includes CVE-2017-8348 in the list of fixed vulnerabilities in imagemagick.
- The provided test case from github user bestshow demonstrates how the vulnerability can be triggered.
