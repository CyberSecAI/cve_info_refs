Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2017-8929.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `sized_string_cmp()` function within the YARA library. This occurs because the `YR_OBJECT_STRING` can be freed while its `value` (a `SIZED_STRING`) is still being referenced by the `sized_string_cmp()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free, where a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This leads to a read access violation.
- Incorrect memory management: The YARA code does not ensure that the lifetime of the `SIZED_STRING` object is managed correctly when it is used in comparison operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Program crash: The immediate impact is a program crash due to the memory access violation.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, a use-after-free vulnerability can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can manipulate the freed memory region and overwrite the object being accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafting a YARA rule that triggers the vulnerability: The attack is triggered by crafting a specific YARA rule that causes the `sized_string_cmp()` function to be called after the `SIZED_STRING` object has been freed. This can happen by triggering a string comparison within a YARA rule that involves a module function (in this case, the `data_md5` module function).
- File scanning: The provided steps indicate that using the crafted rule to scan a file using the `yara` command triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted YARA rule: The attacker needs the ability to provide or load a malicious YARA rule into the YARA engine.
- Ability to scan a file using the crafted rule: The attacker must initiate a scan using the crafted rule and a target file.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs in the following sequence:
1. A YARA rule that uses the `hash` module's `data_md5` function is evaluated.
2. The `data_md5` function sets a string object using `yr_object_set_string`, which allocates memory for a `SIZED_STRING` and assigns its pointer to `YR_OBJECT_STRING`.
3. During rule execution, the string object might be copied, and this copy uses `sized_string_dup` to duplicate the `SIZED_STRING` data.
4. The string object set by `data_md5` is freed, but it's duplicate is still on the stack for comparison.
5. Subsequently, the `sized_string_cmp()` function is called on the copied string, but the original string has already been freed, leading to a use-after-free when accessing its data.

The provided ASAN output shows the exact location of the use-after-free within `sizedstr.c`, the freeing of the memory in `object.c`, and the allocation in `object.c` too.

The fix included in the commit `053e67e3ec81cc9268ce30eaf0d6663d8639ed1e` addresses the vulnerability. The changes include:
- Copying objects during function calls: The function return objects are now copied with `yr_object_copy` and the copy is stored in an arena in `exec.c`.
- Adding `yr_object_copy` function in `object.h` and `object.c` and `sized_string_dup` function in `sizedstr.h` and `sizedstr.c`.
- Freeing copied objects stored in arena before exiting `yr_execute_code` function in `exec.c`
