Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of input parameter validation in the `isub` service of certain Huawei smartphones. This leads to an out-of-bounds array access when a specific parameter is sent to a particular interface.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is insufficient input validation, allowing an attacker to trigger an out-of-bounds array access. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the device to restart.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, forcing the targeted Huawei smartphone to restart.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious application installed on the victim's device. This application then sends specially crafted parameters to the vulnerable `isub` service interface.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to:
    *   Trick the user into installing a malicious application on their Huawei smartphone.
    *   Be able to send specific parameters to the vulnerable interface of the `isub` service.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:**  Huawei P10 and P10 Plus smartphones with versions earlier than VKY-AL00C00B157 and VTR-AL00C00B157 respectively are affected.
*   **CVE ID:** The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2017-8172.
*   **CVSS v3 Score:** Base score is 5.5 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H), Temporal Score: 5.1 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)
*   **Reported By:** Zhou Ye, Xu Lei Yong, Li Bo of 360 Vulpecker Team.
*   **Mitigation:** Huawei released software updates to fix the issue and recommends users update to versions VKY-AL00C00B157 (for P10 Plus) or VTR-AL00C00B157 (for P10).
