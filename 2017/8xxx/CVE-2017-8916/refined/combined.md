# CIS-CAT® Pro

## A powerful tool for automating CIS Benchmark assessment and reporting

The CIS Benchmarks are a powerful set of best practices to help your organization ensure its IT systems, software, networks, and cloud infrastructure are securely configured. Testing those configurations can be a labor-intensive process – and that can be a challenge for many organizations.

As a CIS SecureSuite Member, you gain access to tools that help make assessing and reporting significantly easier and more effective.

Our configuration assessment tool, CIS-CAT Pro, turns the best practices of the CIS Benchmarks and CIS Controls into actionable insights by scanning systems and reporting on their levels of compliance.
