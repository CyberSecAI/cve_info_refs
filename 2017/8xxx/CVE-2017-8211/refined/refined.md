- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the driver of some Huawei smartphones due to the lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to system reboot or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application with root privileges sends a specific, crafted parameter to the vulnerable driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application.
  - The malicious application must have root privileges on the Android system.
  - The attacker must be able to craft specific parameters to trigger the overflow in the driver.
