{
  "CVE-2017-8625": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability exists because MSHTML was not properly restricted under User Mode Code Integrity (UMCI). This allowed Internet Explorer to load restricted objects, specifically ActiveX and COM components, bypassing UMCI restrictions. The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker through a crafted HTML file that loads these restricted objects, leading to code execution.",
    "Root cause": "MSHTML was not enlightened under UMCI, meaning it was not subject to the same restrictions as other OS components and was treated as 'Full Trust'.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper restrictions on MSHTML under UMCI.",
      "Internet Explorer's ability to interface with ActiveX and COM components."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution by loading and executing restricted objects (e.g., WScript.Shell) that are normally blocked by UMCI.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted HTML file.",
      "CHM file"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
       "Ability to deliver crafted HTML or CHM file to the victim.",
       "User interaction to open the malicious file."
    ]
  }
