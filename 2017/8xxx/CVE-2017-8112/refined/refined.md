  "cve": "CVE-2017-8112",
  "description": "Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VMWARE PVSCSI paravirtual SCSI bus emulation support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while initialising SCSI message ring buffer in pvscsi_log2().",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check on the message ring page count provided by the guest during the initialization of the SCSI message ring buffer in the `pvscsi_log2()` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation on guest-provided data"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user inside the guest operating system can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) on the host machine. This can be achieved by triggering an infinite loop, which consumes host CPU cycles, or by crashing the QEMU process.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious guest can set an arbitrary message ring page count, causing the `pvscsi_log2()` function to enter an infinite loop.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be a privileged user inside the guest VM."
  },
    "affected_products":[
        "QEMU"
    ],
  "patch": "The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the message ring page count is neither zero nor exceeds `PVSCSI_SETUP_MSG_RING_MAX_NUM_PAGES` in the `pvscsi_log2()` function. The patch was made available upstream at: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-04/msg04578.html"
