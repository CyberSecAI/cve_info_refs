# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201706-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which may allow a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service or gain
elevated privileges from a guest VM.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.9.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.9.0-r2** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker might cause a Denial of Service or gain escalated
privileges from a guest VM.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.9.0-r2"

```

Subject: CVE-2017-8112 Qemu: scsi: vmw_pvscsi: infinite loop in pvscsi_log2

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VMWARE PVSCSI paravirtual SCSI bus
emulation support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur
while initialising SCSI message ring buffer in pvscsi_ring_init_msg().

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to consume host cpu cycles
or crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-04/msg04578.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1445621>

This issue was independently reported by Li Qiang of Qihoo 360 Gear
Team and YY Z(CC'd).

'CVE-2017-8112' assigned via -> <http://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.
