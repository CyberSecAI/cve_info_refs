Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8196:

**Vulnerability:** Incorrect authorization

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks within the Huawei FusionSphere system. This allows authenticated users to execute commands that they should not have the permission to perform.

**Weaknesses:**
* **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The system fails to properly restrict user actions based on their assigned permissions, leading to unauthorized command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can query, modify, and delete service data.
* **Service Disruption:** The vulnerability can lead to service unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Remote:** While not explicitly a remote attack, the advisory states, "An authenticated attacker could execute commands that he/she should have had no permission to perform", which would be done remotely over a network.
* **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid login credentials to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the Huawei FusionSphere system.
* **Network Access**: The attacker must be able to communicate with the vulnerable system, either through a local or remote network.

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory also mentions other vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-8197 and CVE-2017-8198) related to command injection and SQL injection in the same product.
* The affected product is FusionSphere V100R006C00SPC102(NFV).
* The vulnerability is identified as HWPSIRT-2017-06166.
