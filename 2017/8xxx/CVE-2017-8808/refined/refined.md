Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-8808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue that arises when the MediaWiki configuration variable `$wgShowExceptionDetails` is set to `false` and the browser sends non-standard URL escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-controlled input when exception details are not shown. When a browser sends a URL with non-standard escaping, the application fails to handle it correctly, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to a range of malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with non-standard URL escaping that, when processed by MediaWiki, will inject a malicious script. This crafted URL can be delivered to the victim through various methods, such as:
    - Phishing emails
    - Malicious links on other websites
    - Direct user manipulation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to visit the crafted malicious URL while `$wgShowExceptionDetails` is disabled. They do not require any special privileges or access to the MediaWiki server. They only need to be able to craft a specific URL and get it accessed by a targeted user.
- The attacker needs to be aware that the target MediaWiki instance has  `$wgShowExceptionDetails` set to `false`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is more detailed than the initial CVE description placeholder.
- This vulnerability is fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.29.2, 1.28.3, and 1.27.4.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4036-1 also addresses this CVE, and the fix is available in `mediawiki` version `1:1.27.4-1~deb9u1` for the stable (stretch) distribution.
