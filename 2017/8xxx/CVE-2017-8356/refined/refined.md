Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `ReadSUNImage` function within `sun.c` (line 360) of the ImageMagick library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: The `ReadSUNImage` function allocates memory but fails to free it properly under certain conditions, specifically when processing a crafted SUN image file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By repeatedly providing a specially crafted SUN image file to be processed, an attacker can cause the application to allocate memory without freeing it, eventually leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted SUN Image File: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted SUN image file as input to ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SUN file to a system using ImageMagick, typically by processing this file with ImageMagick via a command-line tool or by an application leveraging the library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in ImageMagick version 7.0.5-5.
- The leak was found during a call to `#identify $FILE`.
- The memory leak is triggered within the `ReadSUNImage` function when processing the crafted SUN image file.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3863-1) lists this vulnerability among others fixed in the imagemagick package.
- A test case is provided in the github issue: `<https://github.com/bestshow/p0cs/blob/master/memory-leak-in-ReadSUNImage-10.sun>`.
- The backtrace indicates that memory allocation happens in `AcquireMagickMemory` and `AcquireQuantumMemory` eventually reaching `ReadSUNImage`
