*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read in the `mark_line_tr()` function within Ghostscript.
*   **Root Cause:** The `mark_line_tr()` function attempts to read memory outside of allocated boundaries.
*   **Location:** `XYZ/ghostpdl/./base/gxscanc.c:2185:29`
*   **Impact:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) due to an invalid memory access.
*   **Attack Vector:** Processing a crafted PostScript file (the provided POC attachment) triggers the vulnerability. The specific command used to trigger the vulnerability is `gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bit -sOUTPUTFILE=/dev/null -dSAFER gs_oobr_mark_line_tr -c quit`.
*   **Affected Software:** Ghostscript.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PostScript file to Ghostscript.
