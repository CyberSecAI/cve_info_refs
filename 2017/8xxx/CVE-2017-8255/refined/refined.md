{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm bootloader. This vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the size of data during certain copy operations within the bootloader's code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Heap buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the bootloader, potentially leading to privilege escalation or complete compromise of the device's boot process and system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation. A malicious application or process already running on the device could attempt to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the affected device and needs to be able to influence parameters passed to the bootloader."
