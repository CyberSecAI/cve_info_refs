  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Command injection in the 'host' parameter of the diagnostic page's ping utility.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection vulnerability in the HTTP management interface.",
     "Unrestricted command execution with root privileges."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution with root privileges, allowing an attacker to start a telnet daemon, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially brick the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the /cgi?2 endpoint, specifically targeting the 'host' parameter within the diagnostic page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be authenticated to the web management interface."
