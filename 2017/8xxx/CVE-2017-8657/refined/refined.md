{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds access of the source buffer occurs during delayed compilation when fetching the source code for a function. The out-of-bounds value is then used as a pointer to the source.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Use of out-of-bounds value as a pointer"
     ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can potentially lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution due to the use of an out-of-bounds memory location as a pointer, making it an exploitable condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted JavaScript file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the malicious JavaScript within the context of a vulnerable Microsoft Edge browser."
