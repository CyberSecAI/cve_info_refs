The provided content is related to CVE-2017-8191.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a weak cryptographic algorithm being used in Huawei FusionSphere OpenStack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of a weak cryptographic algorithm, which is susceptible to cracking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to the cracking of ciphertext, resulting in information leakage on the transmission links.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the transmission links where data is encrypted using the weak cryptographic algorithm.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs access to the affected products and the ability to intercept and analyze encrypted traffic on the transmission links. The attacker does not need specific privileges beyond network access, though access to the product is necessary to make use of the weak algorithm.
