Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8392:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `_bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line` function within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library of binutils. This occurs when processing a binary file that lacks symbols, leading to an attempt to access memory at address 0x0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference in `_bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line`
- Lack of proper handling for cases where symbol information is absent.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault, crashing the `objdump` tool and preventing it from processing the malformed input file.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted binary file as input to `objdump`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious crafted binary file to be processed by `objdump`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was triggered using AFLGo, a directed fuzzing tool
- The issue was found in binutils version 2.28.
- The fix was implemented in commit 97e83a100aa8250be783304bfe0429761c6e6b6b, which addressed the null pointer dereference by preventing the code from accessing memory when no symbols are present
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201709-02) indicates that versions of `sys-devel/binutils` prior to 2.28.1 are affected by this and multiple other CVEs.

The provided information includes more detail than the original CVE description, such as the specific function where the null pointer dereference occurred and the steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
