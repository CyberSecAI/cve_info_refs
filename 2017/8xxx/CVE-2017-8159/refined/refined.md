- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Type confusion vulnerability. A variable is initialized with one data type but later accessed with a different data type during certain register operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion leading to potential buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to buffer overflow, potentially resulting in malicious code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick the victim into executing a malicious app with system privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have system privileges and must trick the user into running a malicious application.
