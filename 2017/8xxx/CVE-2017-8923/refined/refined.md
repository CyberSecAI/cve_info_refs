      "verdict": "RELEVANT",
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "PHP versions through 7.1.5 and 8.0.0 prior to 8.0.11 are susceptible to a vulnerability.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption when string operations are performed. Specifically, the `zend_string_extend` function is vulnerable when called with a specific length, causing a crash. The provided test script demonstrates this by repeatedly concatenating a string, causing the `concat_function` to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). The provided test case specifically demonstrates a Denial of Service (DoS) due to a crash.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a crafted input that results in the vulnerable PHP function `zend_string_extend` being called with a very large length.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by triggering string manipulation functions with large lengths, which can be done remotely if the application allows user-controlled values into string manipulations"

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The advisory states that ONTAP 9 incorporates vulnerable versions of PHP (versions through 7.1.5 and 8.0.0 prior to 8.0.11)",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The PHP vulnerability allows for information disclosure, data modification, or Denial of Service (DoS).",

      "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vectors and required attacker capabilities are not specified in this document.",

    "3": {
      "verdict": "RELEVANT",
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "This bug report details a memory corruption vulnerability in PHP's `zend_string_extend` function, specifically versions prior to PHP 8.0.11.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of memory allocation during string extension, leading to a crash when `zend_string_extend` is used with a large length.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS) due to a segmentation fault when triggered.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by repeated string concatenation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute PHP code and control parameters of string operations. The report doesn't specify any particular attacker position or capability other than the ability to run php."
