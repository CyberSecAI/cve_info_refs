The provided document is a security advisory from Huawei regarding four command injection vulnerabilities in FusionSphere OpenStack. It includes CVE-2017-8134 as one of the identified vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient input validation on four TCP listening ports.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Command injection vulnerabilities exist in FusionSphere OpenStack due to the lack of proper input validation on four different TCP listening ports.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain root privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker residing within the same adjacent network as the vulnerable FusionSphere OpenStack instance can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted messages containing malicious commands to the vulnerable TCP ports.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in the same adjacent network as the vulnerable FusionSphere OpenStack instance. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
