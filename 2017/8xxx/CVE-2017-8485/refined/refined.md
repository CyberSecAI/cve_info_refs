{
  "CVE-2017-8485": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `nt!NtQueryInformationJobObject` system call, when used with `JobObjectBasicLimitInformation` or `JobObjectExtendedLimitInformation`, copies uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode buffers due to alignment holes in the output structure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information disclosure",
        "Kernel stack memory leak"
      ],
      "impact": "Local authenticated attackers can potentially defeat exploit mitigations (like kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space by repeatedly triggering the vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Calling the `nt!NtQueryInformationJobObject` system call directly with the affected information classes (`JobObjectBasicLimitInformation` or `JobObjectExtendedLimitInformation`).",
          "Using the `QueryInformationJobObject` API which calls the vulnerable syscall."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Local access with the ability to create job objects, call syscalls like `NtQueryInformationJobObject` or use the WinAPI function `QueryInformationJobObject`"
    }
  }
