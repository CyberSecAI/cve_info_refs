Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption in the `objcopy` and `strip` tools of the binutils package. Specifically, the code assumes that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections (relocation sections) are always named with a `.rel/.rela` prefix. This assumption is violated when an ELF file has a relocation section with a name not adhering to this convention.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a global buffer overflow. This occurs when the code attempts to access or manipulate memory outside the bounds of an allocated buffer due to the incorrect assumption about relocation section names.
- **Incorrect Assumption:** The core weakness is the flawed logic that relies on the presence of a specific prefix in the names of relocation sections. This brittle assumption leads to the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact, as indicated in the Gentoo Security Advisory, is a Denial of Service (DoS). This occurs when the buffer overflow leads to a crash or abnormal termination of the program. This prevents the `objcopy` or `strip` tools from working correctly, disrupting the compilation or modification of binary files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted ELF File:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted ELF file that includes a relocation section with a name that does not start with `.rel` or `.rela`.
- **Command Line Tool:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable `objcopy` or `strip` tool processes this crafted ELF file using the command line.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input File:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable tool with a crafted ELF file as input. This could involve tricking a user into processing the file with `objcopy` or `strip`.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided bug report from Sourceware indicates that the vulnerability was triggered using AFLGo, which is a directed version of AFL/AFLFast fuzzing tool.
- The fix involves modifying the way relocation sections are handled. The fix removes the assumption about .rel/.rela prefixes and implements a general way of handling relocation section names.
- The bug report also mentions that the issue is a duplicate of bug 21410 and 21413, which further confirms the global buffer overflow within objcopy and strip tools respectively.
- The Gentoo advisory confirms the exploitability of the vulnerability remotely.
- The vulnerability was present in versions of binutils prior to 2.28.1.

This detailed breakdown is consistent with CVE-2017-8393, describing a global buffer overflow vulnerability in binutils' objcopy tool due to an incorrect assumption about relocation section names, which leads to a denial of service.
