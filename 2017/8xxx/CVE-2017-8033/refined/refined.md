Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-8033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a filesystem traversal issue within the Cloud Controller API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Filesystem Traversal:** The Cloud Controller was susceptible to a path traversal attack, allowing a malicious actor to access or write files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A space developer could exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By pushing a specially crafted application, an attacker could write arbitrary files to the Cloud Controller VM. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, such as modifying system configurations, injecting malicious code, or causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attack vector is the pushing of a specially crafted application by a space developer. This implies the attacker needs to have the permissions of a space developer within the Cloud Foundry environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Space Developer Role:** An attacker needs to have the role of a "space developer" in order to push the malicious application.
- **Cloud Foundry Access:** The attacker requires access to a Cloud Foundry environment with the vulnerable Cloud Controller API.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** CAPI-release versions prior to v1.35.0 and cf-release versions prior to v268 were affected.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed by upgrading to Cloud Foundry v268 or later, or CAPI-release 1.35.0 or later for standalone users.
- **Reporting Credit:** The GE Digital Security Team was credited for responsibly reporting the vulnerability.
