Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8087:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of PPPoE/PPP padding within FRITZ!OS 6.83 and 6.80. Instead of using zeros for padding, the system uses random memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Leakage:** The core weakness is a memory leak that occurs when padding PPPoE frames. The padding includes portions of memory that were previously used by the system, potentially revealing sensitive data.
*   **Incorrect Padding:** The padding mechanism in PPPoE/PPP is not implemented correctly, causing the system to use random memory instead of the expected null bytes.
*   **Exposure in PADT frames and short PPP LCP frames:** The vulnerability manifests in PPPoE Discovery protocol PADT frames and short PPP LCP frames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with physical access to the wire between PPPoE endpoints can potentially intercept and view slices of previously transmitted packets or portions of kernel memory. This could expose sensitive information including previous data transmissions, potentially revealing user credentials, network configurations or other private information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector requires physical access to the communication link between PPPoE endpoints. This means an attacker must be positioned on the network infrastructure, i.e., on the wire between the FRITZ!Box and the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker must have physical access to the wire between the PPPoE endpoints to be able to intercept the communication and exploit the memory leak.
*   **Packet Capture:** The attacker needs the capability to capture network traffic to view the leaked memory contents.

**Additional Details:**

* The advisory mentions that this issue is similar to a previously reported vulnerability described at securiteam.com.
* The vulnerability was found in AVM DSL Router Fritz!Box 7490 with FRITZ!OS versions 6.83 and 6.80, and likely affects other Fritz!Box models using similar PPPoE implementations.
* The provided CVSS score is 4.7, with vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/RL:U`, indicating that the attack requires adjacency, low complexity, no privileges, no user interaction, a changed scope, low confidentiality impact, no integrity impact, no availability impact, and the vulnerability is unproven.
* The advisory recommends updating to the newest version of FRITZ!OS to mitigate the vulnerability.
