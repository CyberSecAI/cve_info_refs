- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when creating a page. Specifically, the application does not properly neutralize or encode a crafted XSS payload within the page content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute when other users view the page, allowing for actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker can create a page containing the XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to create pages. The attacker must know or discover that the application does not properly sanitize user input before storing it in a page.
