- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the smartphone to restart or execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must trick a user into installing a malicious application with root privileges. This malicious application then sends a specific parameter to the smartphone to trigger the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to develop a malicious app, trick the user into installing it and get root privileges for the app. The malicious app can then send the crafted parameter to cause the overflow.
