The provided content is related to CVE-2017-8681.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `nt!NtGdiGetPhysicalMonitorDescription` system call. This syscall copies a 256-byte array from the kernel stack to the user-mode client. However, it often uses only a small portion of this buffer to store the monitor description, leaving the rest uninitialized. This uninitialized stack memory can contain sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The core weakness is the disclosure of uninitialized kernel stack memory.
- Lack of Proper Initialization: The kernel fails to zero out the stack buffer before copying to the user-mode, exposing potentially sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass: Attackers can obtain addresses of executable images, kernel stack, kernel pools, and stack cookies. This can defeat certain exploit mitigations like KASLR.
- Information Leak: By repeatedly triggering the vulnerability, attackers can gather information about the kernel's memory layout and other secrets stored in the kernel address space. This leaked information can be used to craft more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the machine.
- System call: The attacker makes a specific system call (`NtGdiGetPhysicalMonitorDescription`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local, authenticated access to the system is required.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code and call system functions.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability by spraying the kernel stack with marker bytes and then calling the vulnerable function to observe the leaked memory, illustrating the information disclosure.
- The vulnerability affects Windows 7 to Windows 10.
