- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple files caused full path disclosures due to enabled error reporting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure. The vulnerability exposes the full path of files, potentially revealing sensitive system information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The disclosure of full file paths can aid attackers in further reconnaissance and exploitation of the system.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by enabled error reporting. It appears that certain files, when accessed, would reveal the server path when errors occur.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger an error to cause the path disclosure. This could be through normal web access or by deliberately triggering an error condition.
