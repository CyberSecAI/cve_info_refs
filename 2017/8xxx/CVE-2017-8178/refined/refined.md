- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient verification of parameter values in the Huawei Email app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send an email containing malicious code. When a user opens the email, the malicious code is executed, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary script code on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted email to a vulnerable Huawei smartphone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim's device. The victim must then open the malicious email.
