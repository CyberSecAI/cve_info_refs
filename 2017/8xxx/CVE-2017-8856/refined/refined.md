The provided content is a security advisory from Veritas regarding multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-8856.

**CVE-2017-8856**

*   **Root Cause:** The `bprd` process on NetBackup master servers allows unauthenticated, arbitrary remote command execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `bprd` process bypasses directory whitelisting, allowing any command to be executed on the system as root/administrator without authentication.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the NetBackup master server with root/administrator privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can remotely send commands to the `bprd` process, bypassing the intended directory whitelisting restrictions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable `bprd` process on the master server. No prior authentication or specific position within the network is required.

The advisory also mentions two other related vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2017-8857**

*   The `bprd` process allows unauthenticated file copy to any NetBackup host in the master server domain, enabling arbitrary remote command execution as root/administrator.

**CVE-2017-8858**

*  The `bprd` process allows unauthenticated remote file write to any NetBackup host in the master server domain. This can be combined with CVE-2017-8857 to write and execute arbitrary code on the target system.

The advisory states that all these vulnerabilities only affect NetBackup Master Servers and not Media Servers or Clients. However, CVE-2017-8857 and 8858 can be used to affect Media Servers and Clients.

The affected products are:

*   NetBackup 8.0 and earlier
*   NetBackup Appliance 3.0 and earlier
