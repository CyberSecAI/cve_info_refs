{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-8477",
  "description": "The win32k!NtGdiMakeFontDir system call discloses large portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `win32k!NtGdiMakeFontDir` system call improperly handles memory, leading to the disclosure of uninitialized kernel stack memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure",
      "Kernel Memory Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially defeat exploit mitigations like Kernel ASLR or read other sensitive information stored in the kernel address space by repeatedly triggering the vulnerability. This allows for potential escalation of privileges by gathering sensitive kernel information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local Access",
        "System Call Abuse"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local authenticated access to the system to execute the vulnerable system call."
