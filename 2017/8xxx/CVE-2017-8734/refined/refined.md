{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `COptionsCollectionCacheItem::GetAt` function within Microsoft Edge's rendering engine (EdgeHTML).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory or potentially achieve remote code execution if the out-of-bounds read can be leveraged to overwrite memory or control program execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is triggered by a crafted HTML page that manipulates the `select` element, specifically by modifying the `multiple` property and adding/removing `optgroup` and `option` elements. This leads to a mismatch between the perceived length of the `options` array in JavaScript and the actual size of the underlying cache buffer used by the browser.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to get the user to open a crafted HTML page with the malicious JavaScript in Microsoft Edge."
  },
  "additional_details": "The provided content includes a proof-of-concept HTML and JavaScript code, along with debug logs, to illustrate the vulnerability. The PoC manipulates the select element's options, triggering the out-of-bounds read when accessing an element beyond the actual size of the options cache. The debug logs show the crash occurring in `COptionsCollectionCacheItem::GetAt` when page heap is applied and memory garbage collection (MemGC) is disabled."
