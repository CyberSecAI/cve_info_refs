The provided content does not directly relate to CVE-2017-8942. It discusses a class of vulnerabilities found in multiple iOS applications related to improper TLS certificate validation and man-in-the-middle attacks. It does list multiple CVEs, but CVE-2017-8942 is not among them.

The content describes the following:

**Root Cause:** Improper or disabled TLS certificate validation in iOS applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Failure to properly validate TLS certificates, allowing the app to accept invalid or self-signed certificates.
- This allows man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks by intercepting and potentially manipulating traffic between the app and the intended server.
- Specific applications are listed with the affected versions and the specific data exposed by this vulnerability. The exposed data generally includes usernames and passwords, but can also include email addresses, authentication tokens, API keys, card numbers, PINs, and other sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept sensitive information, including login credentials.
- An attacker can manipulate data sent to and from the application.
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- An attacker can potentially make authenticated API calls on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physically proximate attackers: Those within Wi-Fi range of the victim.
- Attackers in a privileged network position: Those who control the Wi-Fi network or have access to the network infrastructure.
- Attackers who have compromised a device on the same network as the victim.
- VPN providers or attackers who have gained access to the VPN gateway.
- Internet Service Providers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user's device and the application's server.
- The attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which typically requires control over the network or network equipment.
