Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-8108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Some Lynis tests reuse the same temporary file.
*   Some tests remove this temporary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** A small time window exists where an attacker can recreate the temporary file after it's removed by Lynis, and before it is reused.
*   **Link Following Attack (CWE-59):**  The attacker can recreate the temporary file as a symbolic link to another resource on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Overwrite:** If the target resource is a file, the attacker could overwrite its content.
*   **Code Execution:** Potentially, if the attacker is able to symlink to a location where the contents of the temporary file will be interpreted as code, they can achieve code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** This is a local attack. The attacker needs to be on the same machine running Lynis.
*   **Timing:** The attack relies on precise timing to exploit the small window of opportunity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system with the ability to execute Lynis.
*   **Timing Precision:** The attacker needs to be able to create the symbolic link within the small time window after the temporary file deletion and before its reuse.

**Additional Information**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Scherer.
*   The fix is included in Lynis version 2.5.0 and later.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-59.
*   Linux users can use the `sysctl` command to set `fs.protected_hardlinks=1` and `fs.protected_symlinks=1` as a mitigation to reduce the impact of this type of attack.
