# CVE-2017-8871 Analysis

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8871:

## Summary

CVE-2017-8871 is a vulnerability in libcroco, a CSS parsing library. It is caused by an infinite loop in the `cr_parser_parse_selector_core` function when processing a specially crafted CSS file, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

## Root Cause

The vulnerability lies within the `cr_parser_parse_selector_core` function in `cr-parser.c`. This function, responsible for parsing CSS selectors, enters an infinite loop when it encounters specific sequences within the selector, causing the parsing process to never terminate.

## Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present

- **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is an infinite loop within the CSS parsing logic.
- **Denial of Service:**  The infinite loop results in excessive CPU consumption, rendering the affected application unresponsive.

## Impact of Exploitation

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service as the application becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop and high CPU usage.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The parsing process consumes excessive CPU resources, potentially impacting other processes and system stability.

## Attack Vectors

- **Crafted CSS File:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted CSS file designed to trigger the infinite loop in the parsing function.
- **Remote Attack:** The crafted CSS file can be delivered to a vulnerable system via the network.

## Required Attacker Capabilities/Position

- **Ability to Supply CSS Input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a CSS file to an application that uses the vulnerable libcroco library.
- **No special Privileges:** The attack doesn't require any special privileges on the target system.
- **User Interaction (Potentially):** While the vulnerability doesn't require direct user interaction on some cases, an attacker must somehow make the application parse the malicious CSS. This could be via a web browser, a CSS processing tool or any other program that uses libcroco. Some applications would require user interaction (e.g. opening an HTML page with the crafted CSS file).

## Technical Details
- The vulnerability is located in `cr-parser.c` in the `cr_parser_parse_selector_core` function
- The issue was triggered by a crafted CSS file that caused an infinite loop during selector parsing.
- Reproducer: A crafted `poc2.css` file can trigger the infinite loop
- The issue leads to a denial-of-service condition.

## Additional Information

- **Affected Versions:** Libcroco versions 0.6.12 and prior are vulnerable.
- **Fixed Versions:**  Libcroco 0.6.13 and later versions contain the fix.
- **Upstream Status:**  The upstream project of libcroco was closed as WONTFIX because the project is no longer actively maintained.

## SUSE Specifics

- **SUSE Rating:** SUSE classifies this as a low-severity vulnerability.
- **CVSS Scores:** SUSE has different CVSS scores than the NVD, which has been explained in the SUSE security pages as being due to using a more realistic approach for rating the impact, according to SUSE's criteria.
- **Fixed Packages:** SUSE has released updated packages for various distributions to address this issue (see SUSE advisory links for details)
- **SUSE Bugzilla:** There are two SUSE Bugzilla entries regarding this vulnerability, 1043898 and 1043899.

## Exploit-db
- Exploit-DB ID: 42147, provides more details and a PoC.
- This exploit lists this CVE along with CVE-2017-8834, which can also cause DoS due to memory allocation errors.

## Notes

- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific crafted CSS file.
- This issue can be exploited remotely.
- The issue was found by QFLB.WU and reported on the oss-security mailing list.

This information should be helpful to understand the nature of CVE-2017-8871, its potential impact, and how to mitigate it.
