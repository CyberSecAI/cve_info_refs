The provided content is related to CVE-2017-8687.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `win32k!NtGdiDoBanding` system call, where uninitialized kernel stack memory is disclosed to user-mode clients. Specifically, 8 bytes of uninitialized stack memory are copied to user mode. This occurs due to the way memory is handled during the execution of the `NtGdiDoBanding` call. The vulnerability is triggered when `EndPage` is called on a print job DC.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack Memory Disclosure:** The core issue is the disclosure of uninitialized stack memory. The kernel copies 8 bytes of uninitialized stack memory to a user-mode buffer.
- **Insecure Memory Handling:** The kernel is not properly clearing or initializing the stack memory before copying it to a user-controlled space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Exploiting this vulnerability allows a local authenticated attacker to read portions of kernel memory.
- **ASLR Bypass:** The leaked memory can contain addresses of kernel modules and pool addresses, enabling an attacker to bypass Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR).
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Gaining knowledge of kernel memory layout and addresses opens the door for more advanced exploitation techniques, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to execute code.
- **Trigger the vulnerable system call:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `NtGdiDoBanding` system call, which is executed as a consequence of creating a print job and calling `EndPage`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** Attacker must have local access to the targeted machine.
- **Code Execution:** Attacker must be able to execute code on the system.
- **Privilege:**  Attacker requires an authenticated user account.
