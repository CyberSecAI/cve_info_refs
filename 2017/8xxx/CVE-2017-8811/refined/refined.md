Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way MediaWiki handles raw message parameter expansion, which allows for HTML mangling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Improper Input Handling:** The software fails to properly sanitize or validate input during message parameter expansion, leading to the ability to inject malicious HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **HTML Injection:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code through message parameters, which could lead to a variety of issues, including:
    -   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While not explicitly stated, the ability to inject HTML can often be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, allowing the attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.
    -   **Page Defacement:**  Attackers can alter the visual appearance of the page, potentially misleading users or damaging the site's reputation.
    -   **Phishing:** Malicious content could be used to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the raw message parameter expansion mechanism within MediaWiki. Specifically, by crafting malicious message parameters with special HTML characters or tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to Influence Message Parameters:** An attacker needs the ability to somehow control or inject specially crafted parameters that are used in the message expansion within MediaWiki. This might involve:
    -   Editing a user-controlled wiki page in some manner that influences these parameters.
    -   Exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow modifying the message parameter.
    -   Potentially, the ability to influence the MediaWiki interface itself, if such access is granted.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-8811 in MediaWiki allows for HTML manipulation via message parameter expansion. An attacker can craft messages with malicious HTML, potentially leading to XSS, defacement, or other types of malicious behavior within the context of the MediaWiki site. The attacker needs the ability to influence message parameters in some form. This is a server-side vulnerability relating to sanitization of user input before using it to generate HTML.
