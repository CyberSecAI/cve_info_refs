- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the driver of certain Huawei smartphones due to a lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Specifically, six distinct buffer overflow issues were identified.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to reboot the system or achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application that has root privileges. This app then sends specific, crafted parameters to the vulnerable driver to trigger the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious app. The app must obtain root privileges on the Android system. The attacker also requires knowledge of the vulnerable driver and the specific parameters needed to trigger the overflow. The user must be tricked into installing this malicious application.
