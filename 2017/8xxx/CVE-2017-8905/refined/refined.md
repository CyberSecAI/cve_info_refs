Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8905:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how Xen handles failsafe callbacks when returning to guest mode. Specifically, when a guest kernel triggers an exception that results in a failsafe callback, Xen pushes additional data selectors (DS, ES, FS, GS) onto the guest kernel stack. The check that Xen performs to ensure the address range of the exception or failsafe callback frame doesn't overlap with hypervisor space did not account for these extra 4 slots on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insufficient bounds checking:** The primary weakness is that Xen's stack bounds check before a failsafe callback was inadequate. It did not account for the additional 4 data selector slots placed on the guest kernel stack, resulting in a potential stack overflow, and overwriting memory outside the guest's allocated space.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Memory corruption:** A malicious or buggy 64-bit PV guest could overwrite memory outside of its allocated space.
- **Privilege escalation:** The memory corruption could potentially lead to privilege escalation, allowing the guest to gain access to the hypervisor or other guest's memory.
- **Host or other guest crashes:** The memory corruption could result in crashes of the host system or other guest virtual machines.
- **Information leaks:** Memory corruption can also cause information leaks.

**Attack vectors:**

- A malicious or buggy 64-bit PV guest can trigger a specific condition that leads to a failsafe callback.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have control over a 64-bit PV guest.
- The attacker needs to trigger a condition that leads to a failsafe callback.

**Additional notes:**

- Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is only exposed to 64-bit PV guests. HVM guests and 32-bit PV guests are not vulnerable.
- Only systems with large memory (3.5 TB or 5 TB depending on configuration) are vulnerable due to the specific layout requirements for the stack overflow.
- Xen versions 4.6 and earlier are vulnerable, while Xen versions 4.7 and later are not.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.
