This callback, unlike exception handlers, takes 4 extra arguments on the stack (the saved data selectors DS, ES, FS, and GS).  Prior to placing exception or failsafe callback frames on the guest kernel stack, Xen checks the linear address range to not overlap with hypervisor space.  The range spanned by that check was mistakenly not covering these extra 4 slots.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy 64-bit PV guest may be able to modify part of a physical memory page not belonging to it, potentially allowing for all of privilege escalation, host or other guest crashes, and information leaks.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  64-bit Xen versions 4.6 and earlier are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.7 and later are not vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Only x86 systems with physical memory extending to a configuration dependent boundary (5Tb or 3.5Tb) may be affected.  Whether they are actually affected depends on actual physical memory layout.  The vulnerability is only exposed to 64-bit PV guests.  HVM guests and 32-bit PV guests can't exploit the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only HVM or 32-bit PV guests will avoid the vulnerability.  The vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.

Hypercalls are accessible to guest kernel context only, which certain hypercall handlers make assumptions on. The IRET hypercall (replacing the identically name CPU instruction) is used by guest kernels to transfer control from kernel mode to user mode.  If such an IRET hypercall is placed in the middle of a multicall batch, subsequent operations invoked by the same multicall batch may wrongly assume the guest to still be in kernel mode.  If one or more of these subsequent operations involve operations on page tables, they may be using the wrong root page table, confusing internal accounting.  As a result the guest may gain writable access to some of its page tables.  IMPACT ======  A malicious or buggy 64-bit PV guest may be able to access all of system memory, allowing for all of privilege escalation, host crashes, and information leaks.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All 64-bit Xen versions are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  The vulnerability is only exposed to 64-bit PV guests.  HVM guests and 32-bit PV guests can't exploit the vulnerability.

The internal processing of this, however, does not include zapping the previous type of the page being transferred.  This makes it possible for a PV guest to transfer a page previously used as part of a segment descriptor table to another guest while retaining the "contains segment descriptors" property.  If the destination guest is a PV one of different bitness, it may gain access to segment descriptors it is not normally allowed to have, like 64-bit code segments in a 32-bit PV guest.  If the destination guest is a HVM one, that guest may freely alter the page contents and then hand the page back to the same or another PV guest.  In either case, if the destination PV guest then inserts that page into one of its own descriptor tables, the page still having the designated type results in validation of its contents being skipped.  IMPACT ======  A malicious pair of guests may be able to access all of system memory, allowing for all of privilege escalation, host crashes, and information leaks.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are vulnerable.  Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Running only one out of the three relevant classes of guest (namely: 32-bit PV; 64-bit PV; HVM) on any given host will avoid the vulnerability.  (Note that this must also include any nonprivileged service domains such as stub device model domains.)  The vulnerability can also be avoided if all guest kernels are controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2017-8905 / XSA-215
                              version 3

           possible memory corruption via failsafe callback

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Under certain special conditions Xen reports an exception resulting
from returning to guest mode not via ordinary exception entry points,
but via a so call failsafe callback.  This callback, unlike exception
handlers, takes 4 extra arguments on the stack (the saved data
selectors DS, ES, FS, and GS).  Prior to placing exception or failsafe
callback frames on the guest kernel stack, Xen checks the linear
address range to not overlap with hypervisor space.  The range spanned
by that check was mistakenly not covering these extra 4 slots.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy 64-bit PV guest may be able to modify part of a
physical memory page not belonging to it, potentially allowing for all
of privilege escalation, host or other guest crashes, and information
leaks.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

64-bit Xen versions 4.6 and earlier are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.7
and later are not vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only x86 systems with physical memory extending to a configuration
dependent boundary (5Tb or 3.5Tb) may be affected.  Whether they are
actually affected depends on actual physical memory layout.

The vulnerability is only exposed to 64-bit PV guests.  HVM guests and
32-bit PV guests can't exploit the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or 32-bit PV guests will avoid the vulnerability.

The vulnerability can be avoided if the guest kernel is controlled by
the host rather than guest administrator, provided that further steps
are taken to prevent the guest administrator from loading code into
the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using
other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201705-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, the worst of which
could allow for privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.7.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.7.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.7.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.7.2** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.7.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.7.2** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers and Xen Security Advisory referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with
privileges of Xen (QEMU) process on the host, gain privileges on the host
system, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.7.2-r1:0"

```

All Xen Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.7.2:0"

```

All Xen pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.7.2:0"

```

Today we released three patches for the following vulnerabilities: XSA-213, XSA-214 and XSA-215. Xen Project follows industry-accepted best practices regarding software security. This includes observing an embargo period, during which time the Xen Project security team will assess, respond, and prepare patches fixing the vulnerability, and distribute them privately to software and cloud providers before the public disclosure occurs.

When issuing a Xen Project Security Advisory (XSA), during the embargo this advisory is pre-disclosed to only members on the [Xen Project Pre-Disclosure List](http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html?ref=xenproject.org). Vendors and open source projects who are on the Xen Project pre-disclosure list will not be affected by this security vulnerability and have updated their systems. The Xen Project security team has created fixes for these vulnerabilities, which can be publicly downloaded here: http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/

Public cloud providers on the Xen Project predisclosure list were notified of these vulnerabilities two weeks ago; if your public cloud provider is on the list it is likely that your VMs are not vulnerable. Distributions and other software providers were also notified; they should have updated packages available soon (if they are not available already).

All three vulnerabilities have the potential to enable a guest virtual machine to break out of the hypervisor isolation. However, in order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be running code in kernel mode of one or more VMs on the system. Any system that allows untrusted users to run arbitrary kernels will be particularly vulnerable.

Systems which only allow trusted users (such as IT professionals employed by the company) to run arbitrary kernels are less vulnerable, because an attacker would first need to find one or more exploit in the software running on one of the VMs before being able to then exploit this vulnerability. However, **all users are encouraged to update as soon as possible**.

Any 64-bit PV guest can exploit the vulnerability with XSA-213. The other two are more constrained. XSA-214 requires an attacker to control two different kinds of guests (either a PV one and an HVM one or a 32-bit PV one and 64-bit PV one). XSA-215 only affects you if your host has a very large amount of memory (either 3.5 TiB or 5 TiB depending on configuration).

Again, even with these constraints, we encourage you to update as soon as possible.

We take security very seriously and have developed [security process best practices](http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html?ref=xenproject.org) that are aimed for cloud environments that maximize fairness and transparency. We also have a very strict standard of review when it comes to new code being added to the Xen Project. We run Coverity static analyzer regularly to prevent certain classes of programming errors from being introduced. Additionally, we regularly run a generational fuzzing tool on our instruction emulator.

The Xen Project community developed Live Patching and introduced it into Xen Project 4.7. Now security fixes can be deployed without having to reboot VMs or have significant spare compute capacity to avoid reboots via VM migration.

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Jann Horn, from Google Project Zero.
