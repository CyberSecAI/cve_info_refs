Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8844:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow write in the `read_1g` function within `stream.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the `read_1g` function attempts to write 8 bytes into a buffer that is only 3 bytes long.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) is the primary impact. The overflow causes the program to crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow, making the lrzip tool unusable. The Debian LTS advisory mentions "other unspecified impact via a crafted file", which suggests that other impacts might be possible depending on the specific context and configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted lrzip archive file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `lrzip` tool attempts to decompress a maliciously crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the user a specially crafted `lrzip` archive file.
- The user must then attempt to decompress the file using a vulnerable version of `lrzip`.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo using the American Fuzzy Lop fuzzer.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) file triggering this vulnerability is available at: `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00232-lrzip-heapoverflow-read_1g`.
- The affected version is 0.631.
- Gentoo's security advisory mentions that the vulnerability is both locally and remotely exploitable, suggesting that the crafted file could be delivered via various means, including remote downloads or file sharing.
