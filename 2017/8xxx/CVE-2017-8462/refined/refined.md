Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `nt!NtQueryVolumeInformationFile` system call, specifically when used with the `FileFsVolumeInformation` class.
- The issue stems from uninitialized pool memory being disclosed to user-mode clients due to alignment holes in the output structure, `FILE_FS_VOLUME_INFORMATION`. Specifically, the alignment hole after the `SupportsObjects` field contains uninitialized data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The kernel leaks uninitialized pool memory, which may contain sensitive information from previously stored data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Kernel ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) defeat:**  By repeatedly triggering the vulnerability, a local attacker can potentially obtain kernel memory addresses and bypass ASLR.
- **Disclosure of other kernel secrets:** The leaked memory may contain other sensitive data, which could be used for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local access:** A local, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `NtQueryVolumeInformationFile` system call with the `FileFsVolumeInformation` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a valid account on the target machine.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code and interact with the Windows API.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by requesting `FileFsVolumeInformation` using the `NtQueryVolumeInformationFile` syscall.
- The `FILE_FS_VOLUME_INFORMATION` structure returned by this call has an alignment hole after the `SupportsObjects` field.
- Data present in this alignment hole is not properly initialized by the kernel before being copied to user mode.
- The PoC provided demonstrates this by reading the uninitialized memory which may reveal kernel ASLR information due to special pool markers.

The provided information provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its cause, and how it can be exploited. It also includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrates the issue. This information goes beyond the basic description found in a typical CVE entry.
