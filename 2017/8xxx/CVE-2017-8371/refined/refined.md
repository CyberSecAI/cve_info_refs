- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Passwords are stored in cleartext in random access memory (RAM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information (passwords) stored in cleartext, which is a violation of data security best practices.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of sensitive passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the system. The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality impact and low integrity impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based, with low attack complexity, requiring high privileges to exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need network access to the system and high privileges to access the memory where the cleartext passwords are stored.
