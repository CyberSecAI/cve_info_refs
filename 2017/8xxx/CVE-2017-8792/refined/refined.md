{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `acallow` parameter in `home/seos/courier/web/wmProgressstat.html.php`. This parameter is directly used to set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header without any validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SOP Bypass)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass the Same-Origin Policy (SOP). This allows an attacker to craft a request that will set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to an attacker-controlled domain. This would enable the attacker to perform cross-origin requests, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to `/home/seos/courier/web/wmProgressstat.html.php` with a malicious domain value for the `acallow` parameter along with the `cka` parameter set to `1`. The unsanitized value from `acallow` is then used to construct the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, allowing the attacker's domain to access the resources."
  },
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific authentication is mentioned, indicating that the vulnerability can likely be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker."
