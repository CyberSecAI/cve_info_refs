- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper permission settings for a certain file on the host machine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization, leading to potential resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker could create a large number of virtual machine (VM) processes, exhausting system resources and making new VMs unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be able to log in to the host machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user with access to the host machine.
