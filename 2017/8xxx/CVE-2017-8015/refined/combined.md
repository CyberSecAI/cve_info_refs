ESA-2017-099: EMC AppSync SQL Injection Vulnerability

EMC Identifier: ESA-2017-099
CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-8015
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 8.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

Affected products:
EMC AppSync all versions prior to 3.5

Summary:
EMC AppSync contains a SQL injection vulnerability that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise
the affected system.
Details:

EMC AppSync is affected by a SQL injection vulnerability.  Attackers could potentially exploit this vulnerability to
access information, modify data or disrupt certain services by causing execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the
application using default Apollo framework user accounts "apollo" and "test".

Resolution:
The following EMC AppSync release contains resolution to this vulnerability:
*       EMC AppSync version 3.5 and later (security patch "AppSync Security Update for SQL Injection Vulnerability" is
required on top of version 3.5)

As part of mitigation, default Apollo framework user accounts "apollo" and "test" have been also removed as they are
not used by AppSync application.

EMC recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.

Link to remedies:

Customers can download AppSync 3.5 software from <https://support.emc.com/downloads/25364_AppSync>
Customers can download the security patch "AppSync Security Update for SQL Injection Vulnerability" from
