Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability within EMC AppSync. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a SQL injection flaw, which allows for the manipulation of SQL queries through user-controlled inputs. This enables attackers to bypass security checks and interact directly with the database.
- **Use of default user accounts:** The application utilizes default Apollo framework user accounts "apollo" and "test," which are not required for the application's functionality but were present and potentially usable for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Access:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Modification:** The vulnerability allows attackers to modify data within the database, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
- **Service Disruption:** Attackers can potentially disrupt certain services by causing the execution of arbitrary SQL commands, which might interfere with normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's interface where SQL queries can be influenced by user-provided input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers require network access to the vulnerable EMC AppSync instance.
- They need to be able to send crafted requests that include malicious SQL code.
- The attack can be performed remotely without authentication as the application utilizes default credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of EMC AppSync prior to version 3.5.
- The vulnerability is mitigated in AppSync version 3.5 and later, along with a security patch.
- The default Apollo framework user accounts ("apollo" and "test") have been removed as part of the mitigation.
- The vulnerability was reported by rgod working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
