Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow in the `read_buf` function of the `stream.c` file within the rzip compression program. This overflow occurs during decompression of a crafted archive.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The `read_buf` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The program does not properly validate the input data, which allows an attacker to provide a crafted archive that triggers the overflow. Specifically the size of the read buffer is not correctly handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Crash:** The provided ASan output shows the program crashes due to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a heap-based buffer overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted, by overwriting other heap metadata.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted archive:** The attacker must provide a specially crafted rzip archive to the vulnerable program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted rzip file to be processed by the vulnerable `rzip` program.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
*   The affected version is 2.1.
*   A reproducer is available on GitHub.
*   The vulnerability was triggered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
*   Debian LTS released a fix for this issue in version 2.1-2+deb8u1.
