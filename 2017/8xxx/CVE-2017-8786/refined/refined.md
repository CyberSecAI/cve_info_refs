Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-8786:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow write exists in the `pcre2_get_error_message_32` function within the pcre2 library. This occurs when processing error messages within the `pcre2test` command-line utility. The vulnerability is triggered during the conversion to 32-bit format within the `to32` function which is called by the `process_pattern` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow. Specifically, a write operation exceeds the allocated buffer size on the heap when generating an error message.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process running `pcre2test`. It may also lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input to the `pcre2test` utility. The specific input format that triggers the overflow is not explicitly stated in the provided content, but is available in the reproducer linked in the blog post (https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00220-pcre2-heapoverflow-pcre2_get_error_message_32)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute `pcre2test` with a malicious crafted input. This could be achieved if a user runs this utility with an attacker-controlled input file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The affected version is libpcre2-10.23.
- The fix is available in commit 697 in the pcre2 repository.
- Gentoo Linux has released a security advisory (GLSA 201710-09) addressing this and other PCRE2 vulnerabilities, recommending that users upgrade to version 10.30 or later.
