**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The login form on private MediaWiki instances did not distinguish between login failures caused by an invalid username and those caused by an invalid password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Information disclosure. The login form behavior inadvertently reveals whether a provided username exists on the wiki, aiding attackers in user enumeration.

**Impact of exploitation:**

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through the login form of a private MediaWiki instance. 
- No interaction or specific privileges required for exploitation besides accessing the login form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the private wiki.
- The attacker doesn't require any prior knowledge or valid credentials.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.29.2, 1.28.3, and 1.27.4.
