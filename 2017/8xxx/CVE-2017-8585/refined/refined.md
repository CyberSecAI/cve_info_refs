    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide an invalid culture.",
     "details": "The vulnerability exists in .NET Core. When provided with an invalid culture, a recursive lookup is triggered, leading to a denial of service. This issue is mainly observed on Windows platforms, but can potentially affect other platforms due to self-contained application builds."
