{
  "CVE-2017-8046": {
    "Description": "Malicious PATCH requests submitted to servers using Spring Data REST backed HTTP resources can use specially crafted JSON data to run arbitrary Java code.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Spring Data REST handles PATCH requests with JSON data. Specifically, it allows for the injection of malicious code via specially crafted JSON data within the 'path' field of a JSON patch operation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of JSON PATCH requests.",
      "Lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data.",
      "Deserialization of untrusted data which leads to Remote Code Execution."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary Java code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted PATCH request with a malicious JSON payload to an application exposing Spring Data REST endpoints."
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to send HTTP PATCH requests to a vulnerable server.",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerable Spring Data REST endpoints.",
        "Ability to craft a malicious JSON payload to inject and execute Java code."
    ]
