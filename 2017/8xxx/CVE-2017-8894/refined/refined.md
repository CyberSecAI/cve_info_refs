The provided content includes information about CVE-2017-8894.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   AeroAdmin 4.1 uses an insecure protocol (HTTP) to perform software updates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insecure software update mechanism. The use of HTTP for software updates allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can hijack software updates to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. An attacker intercepts the update process between the client and server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the AeroAdmin client and its update server, likely on the same local network, or through a compromised network path.
