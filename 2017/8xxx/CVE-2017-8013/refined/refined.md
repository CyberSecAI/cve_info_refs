- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The EMC Data Protection Advisor contains undocumented accounts with hardcoded passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hardcoded passwords for the accounts "Apollo System Test", "emc.dpa.agent.logon", and "emc.dpa.metrics.logon".
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded passwords could gain unauthorized access to the EMC Data Protection Advisor, potentially with administrative privileges, via REST APIs, allowing them to compromise the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via REST APIs using the hardcoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs knowledge of the hardcoded passwords and network access to the affected system.
