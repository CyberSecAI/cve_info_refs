Affected products:

Summary:
EMC Data Protection Advisor contains undocumented accounts with hard-coded passwords that could potentially be

Details:
EMC Data Protection Advisor contains undocumented accounts with hard-coded passwords and various privileges. Affected
accounts are: "Apollo System Test", "emc.dpa.agent.logon" and "emc.dpa.metrics.logon". An attacker with knowledge of
the password could potentially use these accounts via REST APIs to gain unauthorized access to EMC Data Protection
Advisor (including potentially access with administrative privileges).

*       EMC Data Protection Advisor version 6.4 patch 130

been removed in versions listed above.

The password for "emc.dpa.agent.logon" account can be now changed via the remediated patches listed above. See release
notes for more information.

EMC recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
