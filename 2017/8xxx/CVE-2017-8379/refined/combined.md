Subject: CVE-2017-8379 Qemu: input: host memory lekage via keyboard

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the keyboard input event handlers support is
vulnerable to a host memory leakage issue. It could occur if a guest user was
to generate large keyboard events, faster than Qemu could process them.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to exhaust host memory,
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-04/msg05599.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1446547>

This issue was reported by Jiang Xin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.)

'CVE-2017-8379' allocated via -> <http://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2408)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton), and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

Security Fix(es):

* Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with Network Block Device (NBD) Server support was vulnerable to a null-pointer dereference issue. The flaw could occur when releasing a client that was not initialized due to failed negotiation. A remote user or process could exploit this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server (denial of service). (CVE-2017-9524)
* An information-exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory. (CVE-2016-4020)
* A memory-leak flaw was found in the Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with USB xHCI controller emulation support. The flaw could occur while doing a USB-device unplug operation. Unplugging the device repeatedly resulted in leaking host memory, which affected other services on the host. A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host or potentially crash the host's QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-7466)
* Multiple CVEs were fixed as a result of rebase to QEMU 2.9.0. (CVE-2016-6888, CVE-2016-7422, CVE-2016-8576, CVE-2016-8669, CVE-2016-8909, CVE-2016-8910, CVE-2016-9907, CVE-2016-9911, CVE-2016-9921, CVE-2016-9922, CVE-2016-10155, CVE-2017-5579, CVE-2017-5973, CVE-2017-6414, CVE-2017-8309, CVE-2017-8379, CVE-2017-9310, CVE-2017-9373, CVE-2017-9374, CVE-2017-9375)

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] input: limit kbd queue depth

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] input: limit kbd queue depth |
| **Date**: | Fri, 28 Apr 2017 10:42:37 +0200 |

```
Apply a limit to the number of items we accept into the keyboard queue.

Impact: Without this limit vnc clients can exhaust host memory by
sending keyboard events faster than qemu feeds them to the guest.
