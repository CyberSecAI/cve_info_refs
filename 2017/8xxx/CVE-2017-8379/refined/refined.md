{
  "CVE-2017-8379": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing limit on the keyboard input queue size in QEMU.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Host memory leakage",
      "Unbounded queue growth"
    ],
    "Impact": "A privileged user inside the guest operating system can send a large number of keyboard events faster than QEMU can process them. This leads to a continuous allocation of host memory, eventually exhausting it and causing a denial-of-service (DoS) on the host.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the virtualized keyboard input mechanism of QEMU. The attacker, having already gained access to a guest VM, triggers the vulnerability from within the VM.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a privileged user account within a guest virtual machine. They must also have the ability to send a large volume of keyboard input events to the virtualized keyboard device."
