Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8802:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Zimbra Email web client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically within email bodies), allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code that is then stored and executed when another user views the content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's Zimbra webmail session. This could potentially result in:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** Access to the victim's emails, contacts, calendar, and other sensitive data.
    - **Integrity Compromise:**  Modification or deletion of the victim's emails, contacts, or other data.
    - **Availability Disruption:**  Denial of service attacks by manipulating the webmail interface.
    - **Session Hijacking:** Capture or modification of the user's session, potentially allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    - **Settings Modification**: Change Zimbra settings of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Email Injection:** Attackers can send a crafted email to a victim that contains malicious JavaScript code embedded within its body.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to view the email and then use the "Show Snippet" function (triggered by the shortcut key "Q") to execute the injected XSS payload. This step can be facilitated by social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker likely needs some degree of social engineering to convince the victim to interact with the malicious email and trigger the XSS payload.
- **Email Sending Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to send emails to the targeted victim using Zimbra.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is triggered when a user accesses the "Show Snippet" functionality using the "Q" shortcut on an email that contains the malicious payload.
- The provided advisory indicates that versions prior to 8.8 GA Release are likely affected. The fix was released in version 8.8.0 Beta2 and is included in the 8.8 GA Release.
