Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `win32k!NtGdiGetOutlineTextMetricsInternalW` system call in Windows.
- The system call returns an 8-byte structure to user-mode (ring-3) applications through its 4th parameter.
-  Only the first 4 bytes of this structure are initialized under normal conditions. The remaining 4 bytes contain leftover data from the kernel stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Kernel Stack Memory Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows user-mode applications to read uninitialized data from the kernel stack. This is a form of information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation allows an attacker to potentially read sensitive information present on the kernel stack. This could include data useful for defeating exploit mitigations (like kernel ASLR) or accessing other secrets stored in kernel memory.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not directly stated, knowledge gained from leaked kernel memory may enable further exploitation by allowing an attacker to bypass security mechanisms like ASLR, or locate other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target Windows system.
- **System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `NtGdiGetOutlineTextMetricsInternalW` system call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a local user, authenticated with access to call system functions.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the targeted machine.

**Additional Details from the Exploit-DB Content:**
- The provided code demonstrates how to spray a portion of the kernel stack with specific values ('A' characters in the PoC). By doing this, it demonstrates that the leaked data is controllable by the attacker, making it a reliable information disclosure.
- The exploit code targets specifically Windows 7 32-bit. However, the description also mentions Windows 10 to be affected.
- The PoC uses the `NtGdiEngCreatePalette` system call to spray kernel stack data.
- The leaked DWORD is confirmed to have the value 0x41414141 when the stack is sprayed with the value 0x41.
