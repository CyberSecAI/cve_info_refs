The provided content is a security advisory from Huawei regarding multiple vulnerabilities in the H323 protocol of their products, including CVE-2017-8200.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE-2017-8200** (and CVE-2017-8199): The root cause is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient verification of crafted H323 packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The software attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer when processing malformed H323 packets.
*   **Insufficient verification of packets:** The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper validation of the incoming packets, allowing malicious data to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Process reboot:** Successful exploitation of this out-of-bounds read vulnerability leads to a process reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is through the network by sending specifically crafted H323 packets to vulnerable Huawei products.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system to be able to send the malicious H323 packets.

**Affected Products:**

*   MAX PRESENCE
*   TP3106
*   TP3206

**Additional Details:**
