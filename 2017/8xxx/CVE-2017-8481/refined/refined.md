- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `nt!NtQueryInformationResourceManager` system call, when called with information class 0, discloses uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Kernel stack memory disclosure. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the system call copies uninitialized data from the kernel stack to a user-mode buffer. Specifically, two uninitialized bytes from the kernel stack are leaked to the client application.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Local authenticated attackers can potentially defeat kernel ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) by repeatedly triggering the vulnerability to read kernel memory.
    -  Attackers can read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered by a local authenticated user calling the `nt!NtQueryInformationResourceManager` system call with information class 0.
    - The attacker controls the output buffer and its size, where the uninitialized data is copied to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  Local user access on a vulnerable Windows system.
    - Ability to execute code.

The provided exploit code is specific to Windows 10 1607 32-bit, but the vulnerability affects Windows 7 to Windows 10.
