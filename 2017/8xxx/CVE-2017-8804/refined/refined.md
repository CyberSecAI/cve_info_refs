{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The xdr_bytes and xdr_string functions in the GNU C Library (glibc) mishandle failures of buffer deserialization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to failure to deallocate the internally allocated buffer when deserialization of buffer contents fails",
      "strlen called on uninitialized buffer",
      "Memory leak in xdr_array and xdr_reference",
      "Incomplete patch for svc_simple.c"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (virtual memory allocation or memory exhaustion if overcommit is not used). The rpc service will crash when the virtual address space is exhausted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted UDP packet to port 111 (rpcbind port)",
      "Sending a crafted UDP packet with specially crafted payload (around 60 bytes)",
      "Sending a crafted packet with large size specified but not the content to be filled"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable rpcbind service."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in the xdr_bytes and xdr_string routines. The issue is disputed with the maintainers saying that it is the caller's responsibility to free the allocated buffer, and not the library's. Patches for the libtirpc and glibc library were provided, but the glibc patch was disputed and considered an application bug and not a glibc vulnerability."
