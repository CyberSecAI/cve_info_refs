Hi everyone,

I am copying here a message I sent to Richard Rowley a month ago to disclose a couple of CSRF in SimpleInvoices. I assumed he was one of the developers of this project, but it looks like I was wrong. I didn't hear anything from him so I decided to open an issue here.

=====

I found multiple CSRF vulnerabilities in SimpleInvoices 2013.1beta.8. The version of Simple Invoices that I used was taken from Bitnami. Unfortunately, it looks like they have taken it out from their library.

None of the security relevant state-changing operations are protected by an anti-CSRF token. For example, consider the POST request to create a new administrator:

POST /index.php?module=user&view=add ...

[headers w/ cookies]

user\_id=test&enabled=1&password\_field=123456&submit=Insert+User&role=1&email=admin2%40example.com&op=insert\_user

An attacker can create an admin user with a CSRF and take over the entire website. The other operations that I have tested are (but I wouldn't exclude the presence of others):

* Enable/disable Paypal: /index.php?id=1&module=preferences&view=save
* Creation of new customers: /index.php?module=customers&view=add
* Change tax rate: /index.php?id=1&module=tax\_rates&view=save
