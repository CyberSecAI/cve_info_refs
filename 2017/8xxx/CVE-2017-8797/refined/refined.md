Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-8797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's NFSv4 server implementation, specifically within the processing of pNFS (Parallel NFS) LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO operands. The root cause lies in the improper validation of the `layout type` value received from a remote client. This unvalidated value is then used as an index to dereference the `nfsd4_layout_ops` array, which can lead to out-of-bounds access, a crash, and a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Improper Input Validation:** The server fails to properly validate the layout type provided by a remote NFSv4 client. It doesn't check if the provided layout type is within valid bounds before using it for indexing an array.

2.  **Out-of-bounds Array Access:** The unvalidated layout type is used as an index into the `nfsd4_layout_ops` array, which contains function pointers. When an attacker provides an out-of-bounds index, the server attempts to dereference invalid memory locations or function pointers which leads to a crash or soft-lockup of the system.

3. **Undefined behavior**  On the normal processing path there is a C undefined behavior weakness that can lead to out of bounds array dereferencing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted NFSv4 LAYOUTGET or GETDEVICEINFO request with an invalid layout type, a remote attacker can cause a soft-lockup or a crash of the NFS server (`knfsd`) and potentially the whole system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **NFSv4 Protocol:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `layout type` field within NFSv4 requests, specifically `LAYOUTGET` and `GETDEVICEINFO` operands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send NFSv4 requests to a vulnerable NFS server.
*   **NFS Export Access:** The attacker must be within the host mask of exported NFSv4 mount.
*   **Optional Source Address Spoofing:** If the attacker is not within the host mask for an exported NFSv4 mount they need the ability to spoof their source address to be within the host mask for an exported NFSv4 mount.

**Additional Notes**
* The kernel must be compiled with CONFIG\_NFSD\_PNFS enabled.
* The vulnerability is triggered when the NFS server receives a LAYOUTGET or GETDEVICEINFO request with a large layout type.

Based on the analyzed content, the vulnerability is primarily a denial-of-service issue due to improper input validation leading to out-of-bounds array access in the NFSv4 server. A remote attacker can exploit the flaw via network packets sent to the vulnerable server.
