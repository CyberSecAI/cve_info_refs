[![@JeffJerseyCow](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25182776?u=4f5b3cef4a464c81571cdd344d31815d22054730&v=4&size=48)](/JeffJerseyCow)[JeffJerseyCow](https://github.com/JeffJerseyCow)opened [on Apr 1, 2017](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/6840#issue-218686233)

I'd like to report a stack buffer overflow bug within RIOT without making it publicly known. I'm still doing some testing at the device level but a bug definitely exists, who is best to discuss with privately?

### @miri64 **[miri64](/miri64)** commented [Apr 25, 2017](#issue-224211976)

Provides a fix and test cases for an off-by-one (actually an off-by-2 and off-by-4) error in the string-to-ipv6-address-conversion.
