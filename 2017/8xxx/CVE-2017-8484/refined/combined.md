The win32k!NtGdiGetOutlineTextMetricsInternalW system call corresponds to the documented GetOutlineTextMetrics API function [1], and is responsible for returning information about the outline text metrics associated with a specific Device Context. The output data is passed to the client via a OUTLINETEXTMETRIC structure [2], which contains fields of various basic types (LONG, WCHAR, BYTE, ...), as well as other embedded structures.

The simplified workflow of the syscall handler is as follows:
  1. Allocate a pool-based buffer with a user-specified size for the output data.
  2. Fill out all of the structure fields in the internal win32k!GreGetOutlineTextMetricsInternalW function.
  3. Copy the contents of the buffer back to user-mode.

Due to the mixture of fields of various widths, the structure has several padding holes which do not correspond to any specific fields, but are required for the correct alignment of the data inside. Since the kernel-mode buffer is not pre-initialized upon allocation, and the holes are also not explicitly initialized in the system call, they end up containing junk data (from previous pool allocations), which is then leaked to the user-mode application.

The initialization metadata of an example pool allocation created upon a request from explorer.exe on Windows 7 32-bit is shown below:

The OUTLINETEXTMETRIC structure starts at offset 0x10, the 0x00 values indicate initialized bytes, while 0xff are the uninitialized ones. Therefore, we can see there are 4 subsequent uninitialized bytes at offsets 0x3d-0x40 of the structure (corresponding to the padding after the otmTextMetrics structure, and the value of the otmFiller byte), and 1 uninitialized byte at offset 0x4b (which is the padding after the otmPanoseNumber structure).

The outcome of the vulnerability can be also observed in practice, by running the attached proof-of-concept program on a Windows system with Special Pools enabled for win32k.sys, and the win32k!gpTmpGlobalFree optimization disabled (so that the allocations actually take place on the pools every time). Then, we can see how the marker byte inserted by Special Pools can be consistently observed at offsets 0x3d-0x40 and 0x4b of the output structure:

In summary, the vulnerability can lead to a repeatable disclosure of 5 bytes (4 subsequent) at fixed offsets of kernel pool allocations with largely controlled size, to a user-mode program. This in turn could make it possible to defeat certain exploit mitigations (kASLR) or get access to other sensitive data stored in the kernel address space.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
