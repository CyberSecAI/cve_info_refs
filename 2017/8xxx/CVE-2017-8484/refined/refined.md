- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `win32k!NtGdiGetOutlineTextMetricsInternalW` system call allocates a pool-based buffer for output data without initializing it. The `OUTLINETEXTMETRIC` structure, which has padding holes for data alignment, is filled in but these padding bytes are not initialized leading to information disclosure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Kernel pool memory disclosure due to uninitialized padding bytes in the `OUTLINETEXTMETRIC` structure.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability allows a user-mode application to read uninitialized kernel memory, which may contain sensitive information. This can be used to bypass exploit mitigations such as kASLR or expose other sensitive kernel data.
- **Attack vectors:**  A local attacker can trigger the vulnerability by calling `GetOutlineTextMetrics` which will lead to the `win32k!NtGdiGetOutlineTextMetricsInternalW` system call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the vulnerable system and be able to call the `GetOutlineTextMetrics` API.
