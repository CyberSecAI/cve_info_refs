Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-8001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a support script within EMC ScaleIO that, when executed in a Linux environment, saves the credentials of the ScaleIO MDM user in clear text within temporary log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive user credentials (ScaleIO MDM user) in plain text within temporary log files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker who gains access to the temporary log files can recover the exposed ScaleIO MDM user credentials, which could lead to further unauthorized access and control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector involves an unprivileged user who has access to the server where the vulnerable support script was executed.
- **File System Access:** The attacker requires the ability to read the temporary log files created by the script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an unprivileged user with local access to the server where the affected EMC ScaleIO support script was executed.
- The attacker needs read access to the temporary log files generated by the script.
