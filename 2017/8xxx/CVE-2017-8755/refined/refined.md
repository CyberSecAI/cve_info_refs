{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the 'JavascriptFunction::ReparseAsmJsModule' function in Microsoft Edge's Chakra JavaScript engine re-parses asm.js modules. The function resets the function body and then re-parses it. However, it doesn't handle cases where the re-parsing ('functionInfo->Parse(functionRef);') throws an exception. If an exception occurs, the function body remains in a reset and invalid state.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper exception handling during the re-parsing of asm.js modules.",
      "The function body is reset before parsing, leading to an invalid state if re-parsing fails."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. By exhausting the stack, an attacker can trigger an exception during the re-parsing process, leaving the function body in an invalid state, potentially leading to a crash or other abnormal behavior of the browser.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through JavaScript code execution in Microsoft Edge. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a way to achieve this by causing a stack overflow during the execution of a recursive function.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable Microsoft Edge browser. This can be achieved by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted website or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow for code execution."
