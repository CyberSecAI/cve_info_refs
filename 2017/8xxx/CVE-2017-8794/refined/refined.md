{
  "vulnerability_id": "CVE-2017-8794",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to unsanitized input in the 'param' parameter of a POST request to smtpg_add.html.php, which is later used in a JavaScript onclick event, creating an XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Unsanitized user input"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution and information disclosure. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser by injecting malicious code into the 'param' parameter.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted POST request to `home/seos/courier/smtpg_add.html.php` with a malicious payload in the `param` parameter. The unsanitized input is then used in a JavaScript `onClick` event. Specifically the code `177: echo \"<input class='button'type='button'value='Back'onClick='window.location=\".htmlentities($back).\">\";`, which does not sanitize the $back parameter before outputting to the HTML resulting in the injection." ,
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected server."
