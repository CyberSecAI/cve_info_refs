Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2017-8839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the `orig_url` parameter in the `/guest/preview.cgi` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code directly into existing JavaScript code on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the lack of proper input validation/sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- This can be exploited to steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim user and gain unauthorized access to the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable through the network via a crafted URL targeting the vulnerable `/guest/preview.cgi` script.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to click on a malicious link or access a webpage containing the malicious URL, while the user is logged into the Peplink device's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to get a logged-in user to click on a crafted URL.
- The web interface of the Peplink device must be accessible to the victim.
