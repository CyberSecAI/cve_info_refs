The provided content relates to CVE-2017-8031.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The UAA (User Account and Authentication) component in Cloud Foundry improperly allows authenticated users of a specific client to revoke tokens of other users associated with the same client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure authorization:  A user is able to revoke tokens that belong to other users of the same client.
-  The vulnerability is present when using opaque tokens or JWT tokens validated through the check\_token endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: A malicious actor could revoke other users' tokens, preventing them from accessing the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an authenticated user with the ability to revoke client tokens.
- The attack vector is the client token revocation endpoint of the UAA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user for a specific client on a vulnerable version of Cloud Foundry and UAA.
- The attacker also needs access to the UAA's token revocation endpoint.
