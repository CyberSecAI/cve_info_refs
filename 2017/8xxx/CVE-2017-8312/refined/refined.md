Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-8312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the processing of malformed subtitles or movie files within the VLC media player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The primary weakness is the insufficient validation or handling of potentially malicious data within subtitle and movie files. This lack of proper input sanitization allows attackers to craft files that can trigger unintended behavior.
*   The vulnerability specifically involves the parsing of subtitle files and movie files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
*   More critically, the vulnerability can potentially allow for the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system. This would allow the attacker to gain control of the system, steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through specially crafted subtitle files or movie files.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious subtitle file or movie file using a vulnerable version of VLC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to create or obtain a malicious subtitle or movie file.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user to open this malicious file with a vulnerable version of VLC. The user must have the vulnerable software installed.
*   The attacker can be remote, as the user can obtain the malicious file from any source including, websites, email attachments, shared file storage, or removable media.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201707-10) explicitly mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited by enticing a user to open a specially crafted subtitles file, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-3899-1) mentions both malformed subtitles and movie files as potential attack vectors.
*   The Debian security advisory notes the fix for this CVE (and others) is included in version `2.2.6-1~deb8u1` of the `vlc` package.
*   Gentoo lists the affected version as any `vlc` package below `2.2.6`.
