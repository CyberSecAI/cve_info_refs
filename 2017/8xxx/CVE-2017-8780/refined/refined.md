The provided content is related to a GitHub issue report for GeniXCMS, specifically issue #74 titled "Comment XSS". This issue describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability related to user comments.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input when processing and displaying comments.
- Specifically, the issue lies in how the application handles HTML tags within user comments, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a comment.
- If an administrator publishes this malicious comment, the code will be executed in the context of the administrator's browser session when they view the comment.
- This can lead to various impacts such as:
    -  Account hijacking: The attacker could steal the admin's session cookies, potentially gaining control of their account.
    -  Data theft: The attacker could access and exfiltrate sensitive information.
    -  Website defacement: The attacker could modify the website's appearance or functionality.
    -  Malware distribution: The attacker could redirect the admin to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:**
- User comment submission: The attacker injects the malicious XSS payload in a comment field.
- This malicious comment will be stored in the application.
- When the admin views the comment, the code will execute in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to submit a comment to the GeniXCMS platform.
- The attacker does not require a privileged account, a standard user account will suffice.
- The attacker will need the knowledge that comments are not properly sanitized.
