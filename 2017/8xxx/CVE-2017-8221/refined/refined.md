  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The camera uses a 'Cloud' functionality to establish a UDP tunnel between the camera and a remote server and between an application and a remote server. This tunnel is established using only the serial number of the targeted camera. The application then sends a request to the remote server asking if the camera with the specific serial number is online. If the camera is online, the tunnel is automatically established between the application and the camera using the cloud server as a relay. The camera then accepts HTTP requests over UDP, including requests for credentials and configuration information. This allows an attacker to bypass NAT and firewalls to reach internal cameras, and to bruteforce credentials.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure 'Cloud' functionality using clear-text UDP tunnels.",
      "Lack of authentication or authorization when establishing the UDP tunnel.",
      "Clear-text transmission of credentials and configuration data over UDP.",
      "Vulnerable to credential brute-forcing attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access the camera's internal network by knowing the camera's serial number, obtain clear text credentials and device configuration. With valid credentials, the attacker can then access the camera's web interface to access video streams and control the camera. The attacker could also leverage access to internal networks through vulnerable devices.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Attacker sends a request with the camera's serial number to the cloud server to establish a UDP tunnel.",
       "Attacker sends HTTP requests over UDP, including requests for credentials and configuration information, to the camera."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the serial number of the targeted camera and have access to the cloud server to establish the UDP tunnel. No prior authentication or device access is needed."
