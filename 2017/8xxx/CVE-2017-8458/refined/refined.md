The content is related to CVE-2017-8458.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the browser's URL bar incorrectly displaying the domain name when a URL with embedded credentials is used (e.g., `https://brave.com@example.com/`). The browser's URL bar showed `brave.com` while the actual page displayed content from `example.com`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: URL spoofing or URL obfuscation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could mislead users into believing they are on a legitimate website when they are actually on a malicious one, potentially leading to phishing attacks, data theft or malware installation.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a URL with embedded credentials, an attacker can trick users into visiting a malicious website while the URL bar displays a legitimate domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted URL to the victim, for example via a link. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
