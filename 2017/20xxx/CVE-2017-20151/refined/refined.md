Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The code was previously vulnerable to XXE attacks because it was using a default `SAXReader` without a custom `EntityResolver`. This allowed the XML parser to resolve external entities, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability lies in the XML parser's ability to resolve external entities defined in an XML document. By crafting a malicious XML document with external entity declarations, an attacker could cause the application to read arbitrary files from the server or trigger other unintended actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server by embedding a malicious external entity in the XML data.
- **Denial of Service:**  It might be possible to trigger denial of service by referencing large files or external resources, exhausting server resources.
- **Other attacks:** In some cases, XXE can be used to perform other attacks such as SSRF.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted XML file as an input to the `XfaFile` class. The `XfaFile` class reads and parses the XML content. By injecting a malicious external entity within this XML content, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply an XML file to the vulnerable `XfaFile` class, and they must be able to control the content of the file. This could happen by manipulating uploaded files or directly providing malicious XML through a specific request.

**Mitigation:**
The commit mitigates the XXE vulnerability by setting a custom `EntityResolver` on the `SAXReader`. The `SafeEmptyEntityResolver`  is implemented to always return an empty `InputSource` for any entity, effectively preventing the parser from resolving external entities.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message "Prevent XXE-vulnerability" clearly indicates the vulnerability being addressed.
- The code change adds a `SafeEmptyEntityResolver` to the `SAXReader`.

This commit provides a more secure approach by explicitly disabling external entity resolution, preventing XXE vulnerabilities.
