Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified CVE:

**CVE-2017-20173**

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of `JRequest::getVar("contentid", 0, "GET")` in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the file `extras/lib_contentmap/json/articlesmarkers.php`. The code constructs a SQL query by concatenating the value of the `contentid` parameter obtained from the GET request without sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `contentid` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive information)
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
    - Privilege escalation
    - Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request, where an attacker can manipulate the `contentid` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges or internal network access is mentioned.

**Code Details:**
The vulnerable line is changed from:
```php
$query->where("id = '" . JRequest::getVar("contentid", 0, "GET") . "'");
```
to:
```php
$query->where("id = '" . intval(JRequest::getVar("contentid", 0, "GET")) . "'");
```
The fix involves using `intval()` to sanitize the `contentid` parameter, which will convert the input to an integer, thus preventing SQL injection.
