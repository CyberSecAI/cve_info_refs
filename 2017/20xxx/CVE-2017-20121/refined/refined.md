Root cause of vulnerability:
The Teradici Management Console 2.2.0 extracts database archives to a predictable directory (/opt/jetty/tmpdeploy). By crafting a malicious archive, an attacker can place or modify files within the web application's directory, leading to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the jetty user has sudo privileges to run a specific script, which can be manipulated for privilege escalation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
1.  Insecure archive extraction: The application extracts database archives to a predictable location, allowing an attacker to overwrite or add files within the web application's directory.
2.  Web shell upload: By uploading a malicious archive containing a web shell (GSP file in this case), the attacker can execute code within the application's context.
3.  Privilege escalation: The 'jetty' user has sudo rights to execute `/opt/jetty/jetty_self_restart.sh` without a password, which is modifiable by the same user, allowing for arbitrary code execution as root.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution as root on the affected system.

Attack vectors:
1.  The attacker must have access to the Settings > Database Management page of the Teradici Management Console.
2.  The attacker crafts a malicious archive containing a web shell and a script to modify `/opt/jetty/jetty_self_restart.sh`.
3.  The attacker uploads the malicious archive through the Database Management page.
4.  The attacker accesses the uploaded web shell through a web browser to trigger the execution of the modified restart script, resulting in root code execution.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
1. The attacker needs to have valid user credentials that allow access to the Database Management page of the Teradici Management Console.
2. The attacker needs the ability to create and upload specially crafted archive files.
