  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input validation in the login form.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Authentication Bypass"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the administrator login and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel. Additionally, the attacker can directly access several sensitive pages, allowing them to manage users, settings, and content.",
  "Attack vectors": "By using the payload `or''='` in the username and password fields on the login page, an attacker can bypass authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the application's login page. No prior authentication is required."
