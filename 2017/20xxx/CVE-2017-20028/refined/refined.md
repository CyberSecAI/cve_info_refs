  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The file upload functionality within the \"What's on your mind?\" text box does not properly check the file extensions or file types, allowing the upload of arbitrary files, including PHP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Insufficient file extension/type validation",
    "Reliance on .htaccess for PHP execution prevention which may not be honored by all server configurations"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the server hosting HumHub.",
  "Attack vectors": "By uploading a malicious PHP file via the \"What's on your mind?\" text box.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A user account is required. Registration is open by default. The target server must not honor .htaccess files to prevent execution of uploaded PHP files."
