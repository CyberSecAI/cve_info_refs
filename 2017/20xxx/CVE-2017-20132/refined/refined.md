Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `product-list.php` script, allowing attackers to inject SQL code via the `pl` parameter.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection (SQLi), specifically boolean-based blind, time-based blind and UNION query injection.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to read arbitrary data from the database.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `pl` parameter in the `product-list.php` script's URL.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific user privileges are needed.

The exploit database entry provides more details than the typical CVE description, including specific payload examples for various SQL injection techniques:
    *   **Boolean-based blind SQLi:** Demonstrates how to infer information based on the truthiness of SQL conditions.
    *   **Time-based blind SQLi:** Shows how to use `SLEEP()` function to make the server delay its response based on SQL conditions.
    *   **UNION query SQLi:**  Illustrates how to use `UNION ALL SELECT` to retrieve data from other database tables.
