The provided content is related to a vulnerability in Elefant CMS 1.3.12-RC, which is not the CVE specified (CVE-2017-20063). However, it details two distinct vulnerabilities that lead to code execution:

**Vulnerability 1: Upload of file with dangerous type**

*   **Root Cause:** The file upload mechanism allows uploading files with dangerous extensions other than `.php` which can be executed by the server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient file extension filtering.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server. An attacker can upload a file containing malicious PHP code and execute it, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An authenticated user with file upload privileges uploads a file with a dangerous extension (e.g., `.php5`)
*  **Required Capabilities:**  An account with the right to upload and manage files (editor or admin role).

**Vulnerability 2: PHP Code Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The layout editor allows users to create HTML templates and use a limited subset of PHP constructs which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient input sanitization in the template editor. Allows injection of PHP code within the permitted template syntax
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server. An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An authenticated user with the right to edit themes injects malicious code into a template.
*  **Required Capabilities:** An account with the right to edit themes (admin role).
