The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a potential vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the possibility of displaying arbitrary characters in the ESSID (Extended Service Set Identifier) field when using the ncurses backend in the `macgeiger` tool. Specifically, UTF-8 characters or terminal escape sequences within an ESSID could cause unexpected display issues or potentially lead to arbitrary command execution in the terminal of the user running the tool.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input sanitization: The tool did not properly sanitize the ESSID string before displaying it, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious characters.
- Terminal escape sequence injection: By crafting a malicious ESSID containing terminal escape codes, an attacker could manipulate the terminal and execute arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unexpected behavior: Display issues within the ncurses-based interface of the `macgeiger` tool.
- Arbitrary command execution: Attackers may be able to execute commands on the machine running `macgeiger` via maliciously crafted ESSIDs.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted WiFi access point (AP): An attacker can create a WiFi AP with an ESSID containing malicious characters.
- Injection via compromised networks: If an attacker compromises an existing AP or network, they can modify the ESSIDs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to set up a WiFi AP: The attacker must be able to control the ESSID of a WiFi access point.
- Proximity to the target: The attacker must be close enough for the target machine running `macgeiger` to detect the malicious WiFi AP.
