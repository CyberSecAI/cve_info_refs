{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses the key of POST data, while only values of POST data are escaped via addslashes, but not keys.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection in the edit subscription functionality, allowing unauthenticated users to inject SQL via POST data keys.",
    "SQL Injection in the sending campaign functionality, allowing authenticated users to inject SQL via the `sendformat` parameter.",
     "Information Disclosure by sorting users by password hash, allowing an authenticated user to brute force password hashes.",
    "Insufficient SQL Injection protection when saving metadata during user subscription due to lack of prepared statements or proper escaping."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform SQL injection to potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database. They can also gain information about password hashes. An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to full database compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST request to `/lists/index.php?p=subscribe` to exploit the subscription update SQL injection.",
     "HTTP POST request to `/lists/admin/?page=send` to exploit the send campaign SQL injection.",
    "HTTP GET request to `/lists/admin/?page=users` to exploit the sort by password vulnerability.",
     "HTTP POST request to `/lists/index.php?p=subscribe` with malformed ID to trigger SQL error."
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "For the subscription update vulnerability, no authentication is required.",
    "For the send campaign vulnerability, a user account with the right to send campaigns is required.",
    "For the sort by password vulnerability, a user account with the right to view users is required.",
     "For the insufficient protection against SQL Injection, no authentication is required."
    ]
