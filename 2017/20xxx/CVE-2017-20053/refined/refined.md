{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Contact Form Manager WordPress plugin does not implement proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and fails to apply proper output encoding, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change arbitrary Contact Form Manager settings due to CSRF vulnerability. Furthermore, an attacker can inject malicious scripts which will be stored and executed in the context of other users due to XSS vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "CSRF: By crafting a malicious request that targets the vulnerable plugin settings functionality. XSS: By injecting malicious scripts via input fields that are not properly sanitized.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "CSRF: An attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage. XSS: An attacker needs to find an entry point that allows injecting malicious scripts and requires a victim to view that content. "
