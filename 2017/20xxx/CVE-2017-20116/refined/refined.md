The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in TrueConf Server v4.3.7, but it **does not relate to CVE-2017-20116**. The content lists vulnerabilities that include:
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Multiple stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of input parameters in several scripts.
* **Open Redirect**:  The `redirect_url` GET parameter is not properly validated, allowing redirection to arbitrary websites.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Exploitable to perform actions with administrative privileges by a logged-in user visiting a malicious site, including creating conferences with XSS payload and stopping the web service.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **XSS (Stored, Reflected, DOM):** Input is not properly sanitized leading to arbitrary HTML/script execution in user browser sessions.
*   **Open Redirect:** Lack of proper verification of the redirect\_url parameter enables redirection to arbitrary external sites.
*   **CSRF:** Lack of proper CSRF protection enables malicious actions by authenticated users visiting a malicious page.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the TrueConf Server web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Open Redirect:** Phishing attacks can be carried out by redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   **CSRF:** Unauthorized actions can be performed on the server, including stopping the web service and creating conferences with embedded malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** Crafting malicious URLs with JavaScript payloads in GET parameters or within POST requests.
*   **Open Redirect:** Creating a URL with a malicious redirect\_url parameter.
*   **CSRF:**  Embedding malicious POST requests within HTML forms on a separate web site.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
*   **XSS:**  Needs to get a user to click on a crafted link or navigate to a page where malicious input is reflected.
*   **Open Redirect:** Needs to lure users into clicking a crafted link.
*   **CSRF:** Needs to have a user authenticated to the TrueConf web interface visit a malicious webpage.
