{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly encode user-supplied input when displaying it in various contexts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Multiple Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to lack of output encoding in various locations such as username fields, version comparison pages, page titles, content block titles and blog post titles and tags.",
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the custom fields component."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can steal cookies, inject JavaScript keyloggers, or bypass CSRF protection.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "An attacker can exploit the persistent XSS vulnerabilities by creating or updating content within the application, injecting malicious JavaScript into fields such as usernames, page titles or blog post information. This payload will then be executed when other users (including administrators) view the affected content.",
    "The reflected XSS vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that, when clicked, will execute JavaScript code in the user's browser."
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "For persistent XSS, an attacker needs a user account with the ability to create content, which is enabled by default.",
    "For reflected XSS, an attacker needs to induce a user to click on a crafted malicious link."
  ]
