The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Navetti PricePoint version 4.6.0.0, as identified by SEC Consult. These vulnerabilities are not related to a specific CVE ID and are described in a security advisory (SEC Consult SA-20170308-0).

Here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**1) SQL Injection (Blind boolean based)**
*   **Root Cause:** The search function in the tree structure does not properly validate user input.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain access to all records stored in the database, with the privileges of the database user.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The vulnerability is present in the `FamilieTreeSearch` function, using the `searchString` parameter via a GET request.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Any authenticated user, from lowest to highest privilege level, can exploit this.

**2) Multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** The web application doesn't sanitize user-provided input in several locations.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper output encoding, allowing malicious JavaScript injection.
*   **Impact:**  A low-privileged user can inject malicious JavaScript that, when executed by a higher-privileged user (e.g., superuser), could lead to privilege escalation, such as creating a new superuser account or adding the attacker to the superuser group.
*   **Attack Vector:** Persistent XSS can be injected through parameters such as the `name` parameter in `/NBN.Host/Component/Competitors/AddEdit` and `/NBN.Host/component/GroupInfo/SaveGroup`, as well as the `Quality105` parameter in `/NBN.Host/Component/ItemSearchGrid/EditData` using POST requests.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs a low-privileged user account.

**3) Multiple reflected cross site scripting vulnerabilities (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** Error messages and the file upload functionality don't properly sanitize user input.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding and sanitization, leading to the ability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript.
*  **Impact:**
     * **Error Messages:** Arbitrary JavaScript code can be injected and executed when user input is reflected in error messages.
     * **File Uploads:**  Malicious JavaScript embedded in a file name will be executed within the file upload dialog when a user uploads a specially crafted file.
*   **Attack Vector:** Reflected XSS is triggered by user input being displayed in error messages and via malicious filenames during file uploads.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker can exploit this with user interaction (e.g. user uploads a file with malicious name).

**4) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
*   **Root Cause:** The application lacks CSRF protection measures.
*   **Weakness:** Absence of CSRF tokens or nonces.
*  **Impact:** Attackers can force users to execute arbitrary requests with the user's privileges by tricking them into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link. This could be used to add, delete, or modify user accounts and application settings.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious website can send forged requests to the application, exploiting the victim's active session with the application. The attacker can trigger actions by the user visiting a malicious website.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick a victim with an active session into visiting a malicious website.

The advisory also mentions that the identified vulnerabilities are fixed in version 4.7.0.0 and higher of Navetti PricePoint.
