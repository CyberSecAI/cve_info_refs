The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in phplist version 3.2.6.

**Vulnerability 1: Edit Subscription**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses the keys of POST data without sanitization in SQL queries, while only the values of POST data are escaped.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection via unsanitized POST key. The application relies on `addslashes` and `htmlspecialchars` which are insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject SQL code, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or deletion.
*  **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `/lists/index.php?p=subscribe`
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is needed.

**Vulnerability 2: Sending Campaign (Admin)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `sendformat` parameter, within the campaign sending functionality, is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection via unsanitized `sendformat` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker with campaign sending privileges can inject SQL code, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or deletion.
*  **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `/lists/admin/?page=send`
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs an account with privileges to send campaigns.

**Vulnerability 3: Sort By Password (Admin)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `sortby` parameter within the user view function is vulnerable to information disclosure. Although non-word characters are removed, the parameter can be set to sort by the password column.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure. The application lacks sufficient input sanitization, allowing an attacker to sort by password hash.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially brute-force password hashes by repeatedly changing a controlled userâ€™s password and observing the user's position in the sorted list.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted HTTP GET request to `/lists/admin/?page=users`
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs an account with privileges to view users.

**Vulnerability 4: Insufficient Protection against SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** When saving user metadata, the application uses HTML encoding rather than prepared statements for sanitization.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper data sanitization. The application HTML encodes the input instead of properly escaping the data for SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Although not immediately exploitable, it creates a potential vulnerability for future query changes. It can currently cause a database error, indicating the lack of proper sanitization.
*  **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `/lists/index.php?p=subscribe`
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is needed.
