The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the SICUNET Physical Access Controller, but does not assign CVE-2017-20039 to any of them.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SN-01: Outdated software:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The device uses outdated versions of PHP (5.2.14), lighttpd (1.4.30), and Linux kernel (2.6.32.9).
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Outdated software has known vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit compared to patched software.
    *   **Impact:**  Easier exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the outdated software.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the outdated software.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to reach the device on the network and exploit a known vulnerability.

*   **SN-02: PHP include():**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses user-supplied input from the `c` parameter in an `include()` statement without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Unsanitized input to the `include()` function allows for arbitrary file access. The usage of the null byte (%00) in the request exploits a known PHP vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file access on the device, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Attack vectors:**  Crafting a web request with a malicious `c` parameter. For example `http://victim.ip.address/?c=../../../../../etc/passwd%00`.
    *  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the device.

*   **SN-03: Unauthenticated remote code execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Insecure string concatenation is used to build commands passed to `exec()` functions.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of sanitization and the use of `exec()` with user-controlled input.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `card_scan_decoder.php` with a malicious `No` parameter, such as `http://victim.ip.address/card_scan_decoder.php?No=0&door=$(sleep 3)`.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the device.

*   **SN-04: Hardcoded root credentials:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The root password is hardcoded and stored in the device's binaries in cleartext. The same password is used for FTP access.
    *  **Weaknesses:**  Hardcoded passwords create an easy way for an attacker to gain root access. The use of the hardcoded password to execute commands with `su -c` and the availability of a default FTP service make the issue more severe.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the device with root access via FTP or by injecting commands that are executed as root.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Logging in to the FTP service or injecting shell commands via other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the device. For FTP access, direct connection or network access to port 21.

*   **SN-05: Passwords stored in plaintext:**
    *  **Root Cause:**  Passwords for web access and controller devices are stored in plaintext within the SQLite database.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Storing passwords in plaintext allows anyone who gains access to the database to easily retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of web access and access to other devices within the installation using retrieved credentials.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Accessing the database through the web interface via the PHP include vulnerability (SN-02), or gaining access to the filesystem using other vulnerabilities like RCE (SN-03) or the hardcoded credentials (SN-04).
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Ability to access the device's filesystem or database either directly, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
