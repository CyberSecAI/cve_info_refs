Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an authentication bypass vulnerability combined with SQL injection (SQLi) in the Hindu Matrimonial Script application. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the login mechanism where a simple input of `'or''='` into both username and password fields allows unauthorized access. Additionally, the content mentions direct access to various admin functionalities (like user, country, community management, etc), likely indicating missing or insufficient authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the admin login using a simple SQL injection payload within the username and password fields (`'or''='`).
- **SQL Injection:** The use of `'or''='` indicates a lack of proper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input, which is then directly passed to a SQL query.
- **Missing Access Controls:** The ability to access admin functionalities without proper authentication highlights a lack of access control and authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the application.
- **Data Manipulation/Disclosure:** With admin access, an attacker can modify, delete, or disclose sensitive data within the application's database. This could include user profiles, personal information, payment details, etc.
- **System/Application Control:** With admin access, an attacker could change settings, add malicious code, or perform other actions that can severely compromise the application and potentially the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the web interface, specifically the admin login page.
- **Direct URL access**: Bypassing the admin login page and using direct URLs, the attacker can access the administrative interface pages without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web application (the affected application must be reachable over the network).
- **Basic Web Interaction Knowledge:** Knowledge of how to use web forms and submit data is required.
- **No Prior Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need any prior valid credentials to execute the login bypass.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit details provided in the content are more specific than a generic CVE description would likely contain. It gives the specific login payload (`'or''='`) and provides a list of vulnerable admin pages.
- The content explicitly mentions SQLi alongside the login bypass as well, though the exact method beyond the `'or''='` is not specified.
- The provided text clearly identifies a critical vulnerability with simple steps to exploit.
- There is no CVE ID associated with the report, it's marked as N/A. This content refers to a specific vulnerability but is not linked to the specified CVE.

**Conclusion:**
This content describes a severe vulnerability in the Hindu Matrimonial Script that allows for complete administrative control via authentication bypass and SQL injection. It's a detailed description of a critical security issue that could result in significant data breaches and/or system compromise if exploited. However, this content does not relate to CVE-2017-20072, as the provided content has a CVE of N/A.
