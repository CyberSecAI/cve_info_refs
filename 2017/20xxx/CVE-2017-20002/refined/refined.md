Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-20002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `shadow` suite incorrectly listing `pts/0` and `pts/1` as physical terminals in the `/etc/securetty` file. This file is used to restrict which terminals the root user can log in from.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Configuration:** The inclusion of `pts/0` and `pts/1` in `/etc/securetty` allows logins from these pseudo-terminals, which are often associated with non-physical connections such as SSH.
- **Bypassing Security Mechanisms:** This incorrect configuration bypasses the `pam_unix` module's `nullok_secure` option, which is intended to only allow passwordless logins from physical terminals.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Local users can escalate to root privileges by logging in without a password on systems that rely on the default `pam_unix nullok_secure` setting and have a blank root password. This is especially prevalent in automatically generated virtual machines.
- **Compromised Systems:** An attacker could gain complete control of a vulnerable system if they have local access or can SSH into the system and obtain a `pts/0` or `pts/1` terminal.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker with a local user account on the system can exploit the vulnerability by directly attempting a passwordless login through a `pts/0` or `pts/1` terminal.
- **Remote Access (SSH):** An attacker can gain a pseudo-terminal (like `pts/0` or `pts/1`) through an SSH connection and then exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the vulnerable system.
- **SSH Access (Potentially):** If the attacker is not local, they need the ability to connect via SSH and obtain a `pts/0` or `pts/1` pseudo-terminal.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specific to configurations that use the `pam_unix` module's `nullok_secure` option and rely on `/etc/securetty` for terminal restrictions.
- The fix for this issue involves removing `pts/0` and `pts/1` from the `/etc/securetty` file.
- Debian 11 (bullseye) and later versions drop the usage of `/etc/securetty`, mitigating this vulnerability.
- The bug report #914957 details the issue and its fix. The fix was backported to Debian 9 (stretch) via the shadow package update `1:4.4-4.1+deb9u1`.
- The bug report #877374 shows the original patch for stretch.
