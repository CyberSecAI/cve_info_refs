Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-20148:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `pkg_postinst` phase of the Logcheck ebuilds. This phase recursively uses `chown -R` to change ownership of the `/etc/logcheck` and `/var/lib/logcheck` directories to the `logcheck` user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Recursive chown:** The use of `chown -R` makes the operation recursive. This means that if an attacker can create hard links within the target directories to point to other files (even outside of those directories), the chown command will follow these links, leading to ownership changes on unintended files.
- **Insecure handling of directories:** The ebuild does not properly validate or sanitize the contents of directories it is recursively acting upon.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with access to the `logcheck` user can exploit this vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker with access to the `logcheck` user can escalate to root privileges by gaining ownership of critical system files. For example, they could create a hard link in /etc/logcheck to point to `/root/.bashrc` and upon a re-install of the package, gain ownership of `/root/.bashrc`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- An attacker needs to create hard links within `/etc/logcheck` or `/var/lib/logcheck` pointing to files they wish to gain ownership of.
- The next time the logcheck package is installed or updated, the `chown -R` command will follow the attackerâ€™s created hard links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a local user account with the same privileges as the `logcheck` user.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was reported in 2017.
- Gentoo has discontinued support for Logcheck, advising users to remove the package.
- A patch was proposed to fix the issue by using fowners to change ownership on specific files/directories and fperms for permissions, without recursive operation.
- The vulnerability also exists in the cronjob for logcheck (`/etc/cron.hourly/logcheck.cron`).
- The affected package is `app-admin/logcheck` versions `<= 1.3.23`.
- The vulnerability is considered exploitable remotely, which is incorrect based on the description. It is a local privilege escalation.
