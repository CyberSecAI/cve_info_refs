Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-20008:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `user` parameter before outputting it in the Points Log admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Redirection to malicious sites
*   Information theft
*   Defacement of the website
*   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `user` parameter of the WordPress admin page. The vulnerable URL is:
```
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mycred&user=1"'><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user to click it (social engineering).
*   No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is triggered by a user interacting with the malicious link.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in `myCRED` plugin versions prior to 1.7.8.
*   The provided patch in the changelog shows the escaping of the `user` parameter's value using `esc_attr()` before outputting it on line 1072 of `/mycred/tags/1.7.8/includes/classes/class.query-log.php`.
* The CVSS score is 8.8, which is rated as high severity.
