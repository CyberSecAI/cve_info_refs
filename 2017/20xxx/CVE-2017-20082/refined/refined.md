The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the JUNG Smart Visu Server, none of which are mentioned in the description of CVE-2017-20082.

**Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Path Traversal:**
    - **Root cause:** The server is vulnerable to path traversal due to insufficient input validation.
    - **Weakness:** Allows access to arbitrary files on the system by manipulating URL paths.
    - **Impact:** Full information disclosure, including sensitive configuration files.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with a path traversal sequence (e.g., `..%252f..%252f`).
    - **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the server.

2. **Backdoor Accounts:**
    - **Root cause:** Presence of two undocumented operating system user accounts.
    - **Weakness:** Undocumented accounts with SSH access.
    - **Impact:** Complete control of the server by gaining root access.
    - **Attack vector:** Using the credentials of the backdoor account to log in via SSH on port 55555.
    - **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs network access and valid credentials of the backdoor accounts.

3. **KNX Group Address Password Bypass:**
    - **Root cause:** Insecure implementation of password protection for KNX group address configuration.
    - **Weakness:** The password can be removed via a simple PUT request.
    - **Impact:** Complete control over the KNX device mapping, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate connected devices.
    - **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted PUT request with a JSON object to the `/rest/items/knxcom_datastore` endpoint.
    - **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the server.

These vulnerabilities are related to the JUNG Smart Visu Server and not related to the CVE ID specified.
