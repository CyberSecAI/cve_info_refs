The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Navetti PricePoint version 4.6.0.0.  It does not reference any specific CVE ID. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2017-20045. However, the content does detail four different vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown:

**1) SQL Injection (Blind boolean based)**
*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the search function of the tree structure.
*   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can access all records stored in the database with the privileges of the database user.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By sending crafted search queries via the `searchString` parameter in a GET request to `/NBN.Host/PMWorkspace/PMWorkspace/FamilieTreeSearch`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Any authenticated user, regardless of privilege level, can exploit this vulnerability.

**2) Multiple Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization when storing user-provided data.
*   **Weakness:** Persistent XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Low-privileged users can inject malicious JavaScript payloads that execute when other users, including administrators, interact with the affected pages. This can lead to privilege escalation by creating new superusers or adding the attacker's account to the superuser group.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Vulnerable parameters include `name` (POST) on `/NBN.Host/Component/Competitors/AddEdit`, `Quality105` (POST) on `/NBN.Host/Component/ItemSearchGrid/EditData`, and `name` (POST) on `/NBN.Host/component/GroupInfo/SaveGroup`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Any authenticated user can inject malicious scripts.

**3) Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient escaping/sanitizing of user input when generating error messages and file names in the file upload dialog.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript payloads that are executed in the context of the victim's browser by tricking them into clicking a crafted link or uploading a specially named file.
*   **Attack Vectors:** User input reflected in error messages and file names during upload are vulnerable.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Attackers need to trick the victim into triggering the vulnerability, e.g., by sending a malicious URL or file.

**4) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms such as CSRF tokens or nonces.
*   **Weakness:** CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can force victims to perform unwanted actions, like adding, deleting users, or modifying application settings.
*   **Attack Vector:** By tricking victims into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site which then sends a request to the vulnerable application on their behalf.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Attackers need to get a victim to load malicious content in their browser while logged into the target application.

The advisory also provides a proof-of-concept for each vulnerability, demonstrating how they can be exploited. The vendor has released version 4.7.0.0 to address these vulnerabilities.
