Hey,

The fix for [CVE-2015-8315](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3fx5-fwvr-xrjg "CVE-2015-8315") was incomplete. Limiting the input to 10,000 chars reduced the risk significantly but it is still possible to cause a delay of 0.3s. Suggested to limit it to 100 chars as there is no reason for a date to be over that :)

PoC:

```
ms=require('ms');
ms('1'.repeat(9998) + 'Q')
//Takes about ~0.3s
```

Thanks,

Karen Yavine

| [@grnd](https://github.com/grnd) [@leo](https://github.com/leo) I offer solution to not simply decrease limit, but to rework parsing, that boost parse speed up to 2 times, look at [#90](https://github.com/vercel/ms/issues/90), code looks cleaner and more simple |
