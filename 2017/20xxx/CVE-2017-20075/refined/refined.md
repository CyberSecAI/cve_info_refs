{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the login form and allows direct access to admin panels without authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Authentication Bypass",
     "Insecure direct object reference"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the application. This enables them to add, edit, and potentially modify all content and configurations.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "By inputting 'or''=' in the username/password fields of the login form",
    "Directly accessing administrative pages."
 ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable application and know the path to admin pages."
