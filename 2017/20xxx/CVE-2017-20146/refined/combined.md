This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

[bugfix] Don't return the origin header when configured to \* ([#116](https://github.com/gorilla/handlers/pull/116))

```
There's no reason to allow for a server to reflect all origin headers.
This has caused numerous security problems in the past.

Collectives™ on Stack Overflow is a new offering in beta release. Currently a Collective requires participation from
a sponsoring organization, so in some cases a Collective may be decommissioned when the sponsorship ends. All questions and

## Package

gomod

github.com/gorilla/handlers
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.3.0

## Patched versions

1.3.0

## Description

Usage of the CORS handler may apply improper CORS headers, allowing the requester to explicitly control the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which bypasses the expected behavior of the Same Origin Policy.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

[bugfix] Don't return the origin header when configured to \* ([#116](https://github.com/gorilla/handlers/pull/116))

```
There's no reason to allow for a server to reflect all origin headers.
This has caused numerous security problems in the past.

# Vulnerability Report: GO-2020-0020

* CVE-2017-20146, GHSA-jcr6-mmjj-pchw
* Affects:
  github.com/gorilla/handlers
* Published: Apr 14, 2021
* Modified: May 20, 2024

Usage of the CORS handler may apply improper CORS headers, allowing the requester to explicitly control the value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which bypasses the expected behavior of the Same Origin Policy.

## Affected Packages

* Path
  Go Versions
  Symbols
* [github.com/gorilla/handlers](/github.com/gorilla/handlers)
  before v1.3.0
  1 unexported affected symbols
  + cors.ServeHTTP
