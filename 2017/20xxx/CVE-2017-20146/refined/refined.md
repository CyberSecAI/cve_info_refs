Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-20146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `gorilla/handlers` CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) handler incorrectly processing the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header when configured to allow all origins using a wildcard (`*`). Instead of strictly returning `*` it was reflecting the request's origin header, which allows an attacker to bypass the Same Origin Policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper CORS Header Handling:** The CORS handler was not treating the wildcard `*` for allowed origins correctly. It was reflecting the incoming `Origin` header in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header instead of always sending back `*` when a wildcard is configured.
*   **Bypassing Same Origin Policy:** By reflecting arbitrary `Origin` headers, the handler effectively allows any website to bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site scripting attacks if the application relies on the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header for security checks.
*   **Data Exposure:** If the server handles sensitive data, an attacker could potentially retrieve this information by sending a request with a forged origin.
*   **Bypass Security Controls:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the security controls enforced by the Same Origin Policy, potentially leading to various malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the server.
*   **Cross-Origin Request:** The attack involves sending a request from a malicious website to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a server utilizing the vulnerable version of the `gorilla/handlers` library, and have a web page under their control.
*   The attacker can be in a remote network position to carry out the exploit.
*   No privileges or user interaction is required to carry out the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves modifying the CORS handler to always return `*` as the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header when a wildcard is configured for allowed origins, instead of reflecting the request's `Origin` header.
*   The vulnerability is present in `gorilla/handlers` versions prior to 1.3.0.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `90663712d74cb411cbef281bc1e08c19d1a76145`.
*   The vulnerability is tracked under CVE-2017-20146 and GHSA-jcr6-mmjj-pchw.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
