Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-20189

**Root Cause:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The `org.clojure:clojure` library is vulnerable to insecure deserialization, where a crafted serialized object can execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the ability to pass a malicious payload via a serialized object, which then executes code during the deserialization process.
*   **Gadget Chain:** The vulnerability leverages a specific "gadget chain" of method calls within the Clojure library that lead to arbitrary code execution. The specific chain is:
    *   `ObjectInputStream.readObject()`
    *   `HashMap.readObject()`
    *   `AbstractTableModel$ff19274a.hashCode()`
    *   `clojure.core$comp$fn__4727.invoke()`
    *   `clojure.core$constantly$fn__4614.invoke()`
    *   `clojure.main$eval_opt.invoke()`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The attacker can potentially gain complete control over the system, leading to a total loss of confidentiality (data disclosure), integrity (data modification), and availability (service disruption).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious serialized object to be deserialized by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Elevated Trust:** The attacker likely needs to be in a position with some level of trust to be able to pass a malicious payload that will be deserialized.
*   **Payload Construction:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized object containing the specific gadget chain.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects `org.clojure:clojure` versions prior to 1.9.0 (specifically versions [1.2.0,1.9.0)).
*   The fix is to upgrade to version 1.9.0 or higher.
*   The attacker would likely need to have some trust to pass a malicious payload, and the attack depends on conditions that are not entirely under his control.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exists demonstrating the exploit.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data).

**Mitigation:**
*   The primary mitigation is to upgrade the `org.clojure:clojure` library to version 1.9.0 or higher.
*   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
