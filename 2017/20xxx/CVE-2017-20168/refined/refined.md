Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied input (`$_GET['key']`) in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability was the lack of sanitization of the `key` parameter received through the HTTP GET method before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the `key` parameter.
- This could lead to various impacts such as unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, or even complete compromise of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `api.php` file, where the vulnerable code resides.
- The attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the `key` parameter in the GET request.
- Example: `api.php?key=value' OR '1'='1`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the `api.php` file.
- No special user privileges are required as this vulnerability was located in the api.php file.

**Code Change:**
- The vulnerability was mitigated by using `mysqli_real_escape_string()` to escape the user-supplied input before using it in the SQL query.

```diff

 include('common.php');
 $con = mysqli_connect("$db_host","$db_user","$db_pass","$db_name");
 $key = $_GET['key'];
-$key = mysqli_real_escape_string($con, $_GET['key']);
+$key = mysqli_real_escape_string($con, $key);
 if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
 echo "Failed to connect to MySQL. Make sure to edit the common.php file: " . mysqli_connect_error();
 }

```
The diff shows the addition of the escape function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message "Fixed SQL Injection Issues" clearly indicates the nature of the fix.
- The pull request #23 also confirms that this commit was intended to fix the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The comments in the pull request show that the vulnerability was found and fixed.
