{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The VaultPress WordPress plugin communicates in cleartext, making it susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cleartext communication, lack of encryption for sensitive data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can sniff the unencrypted communication and execute arbitrary PHP code on the affected WordPress host.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the WordPress site and the VaultPress service, allowing them to eavesdrop on the unencrypted communication. "
