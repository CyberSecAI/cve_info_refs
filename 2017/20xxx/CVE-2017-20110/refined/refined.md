The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Teleopti WFM versions 7.1.0 and earlier.

**Vulnerability 1: Server response contains plaintext username and password**

*   **Root Cause:** The server, upon request to the GetOneTenant page, includes the database username, password, database server name, and IP address in the JSON response.
*   **Weakness:** Information disclosure of sensitive database credentials.
*   **Impact:** A remote, authenticated attacker can obtain database credentials, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/TeleoptiWFM/Administration/GetOneTenant`.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  A valid, authenticated user account on the Teleopti WFM application is needed.

**Vulnerability 2: Server response contains password hashes and authorization tokens**

*   **Root Cause:** The server provides a JSON response to a GET request at `/TeleoptiWFM/Administration/Users` which includes user password hashes and access tokens.
*   **Weakness:** Information disclosure of user password hashes and access tokens.
*   **Impact:** A remote, authenticated attacker can retrieve password hashes and access tokens for all administrative users, leading to account compromise and potential full system access.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a GET request to `/TeleoptiWFM/Administration/Users`.
*  **Required Capabilities:** A valid, authenticated user account on the Teleopti WFM application is needed.

**Vulnerability 3: Improper Data Validation Allowing Unauthenticated Admin User Creation**

*   **Root Cause:** Client-side validation on the `/TeleoptiWFM/Administration` page relies on a boolean response from the "HasNoUser" page, which can be manipulated by an unauthenticated attacker. The server lacks server-side validation on the AddFirstUser page.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of server-side validation allowing the creation of admin users.
*   **Impact:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can create an admin user, gaining full administrative access to the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the response from the "HasNoUser" page and sending a POST request to `/TeleoptiWFM/Administration/AddFirstUser`.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  No authentication is required.
