The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in phplist version 3.2.6.

**Vulnerability 1: Edit Subscription**
*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of POST data keys in the subscription update functionality. While values are escaped with `addslashes` and `htmlspecialchars`, the keys are not, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input sanitization on POST keys. Reliance on `addslashes` and `htmlspecialchars` which are insufficient for SQL injection prevention.
*   **Impact:** Unauthenticated users can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Attack vector:**  Sending a crafted POST request to `/lists/index.php?p=subscribe` with malicious SQL in the POST key (e.g., `list[2 or extractvalue(1,version()) ]`).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated user, remote access to the application.

**Vulnerability 2: Sending Campaign (Admin)**
*   **Root cause:** The `sendformat` parameter within the campaign sending functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation of the `sendformat` parameter which is directly used in an SQL UPDATE query.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can perform SQL injection, enabling data extraction via error-based techniques or potentially other malicious actions.
*  **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/lists/admin/?page=send` with malicious SQL in the `sendformat` parameter (e.g., `HTML" or extractvalue(1,version()) -- -`).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user with the permission to send campaigns.

**Vulnerability 3: Sort By: Password (Admin)**
*   **Root cause:** The `sortby` parameter in the user listing is vulnerable as it doesn't properly sanitize or validate input before use.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation of the `sortby` parameter, allowing an attacker to sort by sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of password hashes. An attacker can brute-force characters of password hashes by sorting the user list repeatedly.
*   **Attack vector:**  Crafted GET request to `/lists/admin/?page=users` with `sortby` parameter set to `password`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user with the permission to view users.

**Vulnerability 4: Insufficient Protection against SQL Injection**
*   **Root cause:** When saving subscription metadata, user-provided data is not properly escaped nor are prepared statements used.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input sanitization and reliance on HTML encoding as a defense against SQL injection.
*   **Impact:**  While not directly exploitable at the time of discovery, this creates potential for future exploitation if the query logic changes. An attacker can cause database errors.
*   **Attack vector:**  Crafted POST request to `/lists/index.php?p=subscribe` with a slash in the `id` parameter.
*    **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated user, remote access to the application.
