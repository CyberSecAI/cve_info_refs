Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL Injection vulnerability in the Online Hotel Booking System Pro WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g. user credentials, booking information).
    - Data modification or deletion.
    - Potential compromise of the underlying database and server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `roomtype-details.php` script.
- Specifically, the `tid` parameter is used to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- No authentication is explicitly required. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted URLs to the affected endpoint.
