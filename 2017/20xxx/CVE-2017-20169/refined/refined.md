The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository. It shows changes made to `config.php` and `svr_request_pub.php`. The commit message indicates "protection against sql injections".

Here's a breakdown of the relevant changes:

**svr_request_pub.php:**

*   **Vulnerability:** The original code was vulnerable to SQL injection. Input from `$_POST` was directly inserted into SQL queries without proper sanitization, using `post_input()`. This could allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code via HTTP parameters.
*   **Mitigation:** The commit addresses this vulnerability by adding `mysqli_real_escape_string()` to sanitize most, if not all, user-provided inputs obtained via the `post_input()` function before they are used in SQL queries. This function escapes special characters in the input to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL code.
    *   Specifically, the diff shows changes in the `handle_set_online`, `handle_set_online_ids`, `handle_shutdown`, `handle_c_conn`, `handle_c_disc`, and `handle_auth` functions where user input from `$_POST` was being escaped using `mysqli_real_escape_string()`

**config.php:**
* No vulnerability was fixed in this file. It only has a minor change, removing the `$patchesdbcon = NULL;` line

**Summary:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of input sanitization leading to SQL Injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability in `svr_request_pub.php`.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data in the database. This could lead to data breaches, loss of data integrity, or complete compromise of the application.
*   **Attack vectors:** Attacker sends malicious HTTP POST requests to `svr_request_pub.php` with crafted parameters that contain SQL injection payloads.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `svr_request_pub.php` endpoint and understand the expected parameters.

The commit mitigates the SQL injection vulnerability by using `mysqli_real_escape_string()` for input sanitization.
