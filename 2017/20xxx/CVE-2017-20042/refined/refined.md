The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Navetti PricePoint version 4.6.0.0, which are addressed in version 4.7.0.0. The vulnerabilities are:

**1) SQL Injection (Blind boolean based)**
*   **Root cause:** Insufficient validation of user input in the search function of the tree structure.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain access to all records stored in the database with the privileges of the database user.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `/NBN.Host/PMWorkspace/PMWorkspace/FamilieTreeSearch` endpoint with a malicious `searchString` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any user with any privilege level can exploit this.

**2) Multiple persistent cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities**
*   **Root cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user input in multiple parameters used in the application.
*   **Weakness:** Persistent XSS vulnerability
*  **Impact:** Low privileged users can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can be executed by high-privileged users to elevate the attacker's privileges by creating new superusers or adding the attacker to the superuser group.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints such as `/NBN.Host/Component/Competitors/AddEdit`, `/NBN.Host/Component/ItemSearchGrid/EditData`, and `/NBN.Host/component/GroupInfo/SaveGroup` with malicious payloads in the `name` or `Quality105` parameters
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any user, even low-privileged, can perform this attack

**3) Multiple reflected cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities**
*   **Root cause:** User input is not properly escaped/sanitized when reflected in error messages or in file names when uploading.
*  **Weakness:** Reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Attack vector:**
    *   Crafting input that will be reflected in error messages.
    *   Uploading a file with a malicious file name.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any user can potentially exploit these vulnerabilities.

**4) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
*   **Root cause:** Lack of CSRF protection (e.g., no CSRF tokens or nonces).
*   **Weakness:** CSRF vulnerability
*   **Impact:** An attacker can force a victim to execute arbitrary requests, such as adding, deleting, or modifying users and settings.
*   **Attack vector:** The attacker tricks the victim into clicking a malicious link/visiting a website that sends a request to the application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the victim click a malicious link or visit a crafted webpage while being authenticated to the target application.
