```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the admin login functionality. Specifically, the application uses a vulnerable SQL query that does not properly sanitize user input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Authentication Bypass"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass admin authentication, potentially gaining full control over the application. Additionally, the application has several unprotected admin panels that can be directly accessed by a non-authenticated user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through the login form, where the attacker injects SQL code into the username and password fields. The application then attempts to execute the malicious query and bypasses the authentication process. The unprotected admin panels are accessed through direct URL entry.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and access the login form. No prior authentication or specific network position is required."
