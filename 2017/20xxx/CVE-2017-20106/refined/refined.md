- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Lithium Forum web application's "Compose Message" function allows users to specify an image URL via the `upload_url` parameter. The application processes this URL server-side without proper validation, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application fetches the resource at the provided URL on the server side without proper validation, enabling an attacker to make requests to internal or external resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Internal and external port scanning: Attackers can use the vulnerability to probe internal network infrastructure and identify open ports or running services.
    - Potential mail spoofing: The vulnerability could be used to trigger mail spoofing by redirecting headers.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is via the "Compose Message" function within the Lithium Forum web application, using a POST request. The vulnerable parameter is `upload_url`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - A low-privileged user account on the Lithium Forum web application.
    - No user interaction is required beyond submitting the crafted request.
