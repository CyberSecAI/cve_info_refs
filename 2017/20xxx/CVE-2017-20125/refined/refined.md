{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data. The attacker could also potentially use SQL injection to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the `roomtype-details.php` file, where the `tid` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is running. The attacker must be able to modify the `tid` parameter in the URL request."
