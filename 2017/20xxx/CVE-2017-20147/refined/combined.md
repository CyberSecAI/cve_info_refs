| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-09-16 18:01:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 494768](attachment.cgi?id=494768 "smokeping-2.6.11-r1.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=494768&action=edit "smokeping-2.6.11-r1.ebuild")] smokeping-2.6.11-r1.ebuild  The init script for smokeping gives ownership of its PID file directory to the "smokeping" user:    start() {       checkconfig || return 1        checkpath -d -m 0755 -o smokeping:smokeping /run/smokeping       ...  This can be exploited by the "smokeping" user to kill root processes, since when the service is stopped, root will send a SIGTERM to the contents of the PID file (which are under the control of the "smokeping" user).  Since smokeping cannot drop privileges itself, there is no way to safely use the PID file that it creates: to run as a restricted user, we need start-stop-daemon to execute smokeping as a restricted user, after which it's already to late.  I've rewritten the init script to work around this by passing "--nodaemon" to smokeping, and by letting OpenRC background it and manage its PID file. Since smokeping insists on writing a PID file (it won't start otherwise), I've modified the ebuild to stick the unsafe PID file in /var/lib/smokeping. Now that /run/smokeping is unused, the tmpfiles.d entry is no longer needed. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-09-16 18:02:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 494770](attachment.cgi?id=494770 "smokeping.init.5") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=494770&action=edit "smokeping.init.5")] smokeping.init.5 ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-09-16 18:05:07 UTC  ``` One more thing: I dropped the line,    checkpath -d -m 0755 -o smokeping:smokeping /var/cache/smokeping  because /var/cache/smokeping doesn't appear in the config anywhere (and apparently systemd doesn't need it). If I messed that up, just add it back. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  D'juan McDonald (domhnall)    2017-10-03 06:58:57 UTC  ``` @maintainer(s), ebuild provided, please call for stabilization when ready, thank you.
