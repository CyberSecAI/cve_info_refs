Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Movie Portal Script 7.36 suffers from multiple vulnerabilities stemming from insecure coding practices, primarily:

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the page, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Error-Based SQL Injection:**
    *   Vulnerable URLs:
        *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/show_news.php?id=`
        *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/show_misc_video.php?id=`
        *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/film-rating.php?v=`
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `id`, `v`
    *   The application reveals error messages that can be used to infer information about the database structure and content, due to the unsanitized input.
*   **Union Query SQL Injection:**
    *   Vulnerable URLs:
        *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/movie.php?f=`
        *  `http://localhost/[PATH]/artist-display.php?act=`
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `f`, `act`
    *   The application allows attackers to inject their own SQL queries and extract sensitive data from the database via the UNION operator.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   Vulnerable URL: `http://localhost/[PATH]/movie.php?f=`
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `f`
    *   The application reflects unvalidated input back to the user, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal details, and other confidential data.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data, potentially disrupting the application or causing financial damage.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** In some cases, it can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the database server, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the system.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect the victim to malicious websites or inject malicious code into the application.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to display fake login forms and steal user credentials.
    *   **Defacement:** The attacker could change the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET requests:** All listed vulnerabilities are triggered via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the query parameters in the URLs, this makes them easy to exploit.
*   **Web Browser:** XSS attacks are delivered to the user's browser and executed within the user's browser environment.
*   **Public Network:** All vulnerabilities can be triggered through publicly accessible URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic web application knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to construct HTTP GET requests and how to use web browsers to interact with web applications.
*   **Knowledge of SQL injection techniques:**  For SQLi vulnerabilities, the attacker should be familiar with SQL injection syntax and techniques such as error-based and UNION-based injection.
*   **Ability to inject javascript:** For XSS attacks, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page.
*   **No prior authentication or access:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit these vulnerabilities; they can be exploited by anyone who can access the application's web pages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit-db entry does not have a CVE associated with it.
*   The exploit-db entry provides specific payloads that can be used to verify and exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   The entry also includes references to the vulnerable software and vendor.
