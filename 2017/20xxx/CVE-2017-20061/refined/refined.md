The provided content describes multiple persistent and reflected XSS vulnerabilities in Elefant CMS version 1.3.12-RC.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding of user-supplied data when displayed within the application's administrative interface and when comparing versions of components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Multiple Persistent XSS:**
    *   Username is echoed without encoding in various admin backend locations.
    *   Various component fields (e.g., user profile, page metadata) are echoed unencoded when comparing versions.
    *   Page titles and content block titles are echoed unencoded.
    *   Blog post titles and tags are echoed unencoded.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   The `name` parameter in the custom fields component is vulnerable to reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker could steal cookies.
*   JavaScript keyloggers could be injected.
*   CSRF protection could be bypassed.
*   Arbitrary malicious code can be executed in the context of other users’ browsers, leading to potential account takeover or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Persistent XSS:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by submitting it as part of user data, such as username, component fields, page/block titles, and blog post titles/tags. When other users (especially administrators) view the affected pages, the injected code executes in their browser.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a payload in the `name` parameter which, when clicked, executes the malicious script in the victim’s browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Persistent XSS:**
    *   User account required to register/update profile, create pages/blogs.
    *   For the username-related XSS, the attacker just needs to register a user account since registration is open by default.
    *   For page and blog post XSS, the attacker needs an account with permissions to create pages or blog posts.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   No authentication needed to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL or embed the URL in a way that it gets automatically accessed by an application.
