The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Navetti PricePoint version 4.6.0.0. This advisory was released by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab. The vulnerabilities are:

**1) SQL Injection (Blind boolean based):**
   - **Root Cause:** The search function within the tree structure does not properly validate user input.
   - **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** An attacker, with any privilege level, can inject arbitrary SQL commands and potentially read the entire database.
   - **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `searchString` parameter in the `/NBN.Host/PMWorkspace/PMWorkspace/FamilieTreeSearch` URL via a GET request.
   - **Required Capabilities:** Access to the application's search functionality.

**2) Multiple Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input before storing it in the database.
   - **Weakness:** Persistent XSS vulnerabilities.
   - **Impact:** Low-privileged users can inject malicious JavaScript payloads that are executed when other users, including administrators, view the affected content. This can lead to privilege escalation by creating new superusers or adding the attacker's account to the superuser group.
   - **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious JavaScript in parameters such as `name` in the `/NBN.Host/Component/Competitors/AddEdit`, `Quality105` in `/NBN.Host/Component/ItemSearchGrid/EditData`, or `name` in `/NBN.Host/component/GroupInfo/SaveGroup` URLs, all via POST requests.
   - **Required Capabilities:** User account with access to the affected pages.

**3) Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Root Cause:** User input is not properly sanitized in error messages and file upload functionality.
  - **Weakness:** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
  - **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by crafting malicious URLs or filenames.
  - **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code through error messages that reflect user input and via file upload dialogs by using crafted filenames such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookies)>.xlsx`.
  - **Required Capabilities:** Ability to trigger error messages or file upload functionality.

**4) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
  - **Root Cause:** The application lacks CSRF protection mechanisms such as tokens or nonces.
  - **Weakness:** CSRF vulnerability.
  - **Impact:** An attacker can force a victim user to execute arbitrary actions, like deleting users or changing internal settings.
  - **Attack Vector:** By tricking a logged-in user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious webpage that performs actions on the application. The provided proof of concept involves deleting a user account.
  - **Required Capabilities:** Ability to host a malicious website and to trick a victim into visiting the website while they are logged into the vulnerable application.

The advisory notes that the vulnerabilities were identified in Navetti PricePoint version 4.6.0.0 and were fixed in version 4.7.0.0. The advisory provides a detailed description of the vulnerabilities, proof of concepts, vendor contact timeline, solution, and workaround (which is stated as "No workaround available").
