### @ssl **[ssl](/ssl)** commented [Mar 1, 2017](#issue-210961932) • edited Loading

REQUEST\_URI is not parsed by PHP - only by new browsers.

Can be used for XSS with curl or for example file get contents.

`[url]?x="><h1>Hi</h1>`

Using path travel and viewer.php you can get files like the config file.

`[url]/viewer.php?type=png&file=../png/../png/../png/jAfQv`

Sorry, something went wrong.
