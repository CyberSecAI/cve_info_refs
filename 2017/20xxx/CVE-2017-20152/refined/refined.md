Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from two issues:
1.  **Path Traversal:** The `viewer.php` script was vulnerable to path traversal attacks. It directly concatenated user-supplied input (`$file` and `$type`) into a file path without proper sanitization. This allowed an attacker to navigate the file system using `../` sequences and access arbitrary files on the server.
2. **XSS Vulnerability**: The `REQUEST_URI` was not parsed correctly by PHP, leading to an XSS vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited using curl or functions like `file_get_contents`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The `viewer.php` script constructs a file path using user-provided parameters (`type` and `file`) without sufficient validation or sanitization.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `REQUEST_URI` could be manipulated to inject malicious scripts

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers could access sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files containing credentials or other confidential data.
*   **XSS:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions on user browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The attacker manipulates the `file` parameter in the `viewer.php` URL to include `../` sequences, navigating outside of the intended image directories. For example: `/viewer.php?type=png&file=../png/../png/../png/jAfQv`
*   **XSS:** The attacker manipulates the `REQUEST_URI` in the URL to inject malicious scripts. For example: `[url]?x="><h1>Hi</h1>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No prior authentication or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
* The attacker must be able to manipulate URL parameters.

**Additional Details:**
* The commit `bd23c784f0e5cb12f66d15c100248449f87d72e2` fixed the path traversal vulnerability by adding `realpath()` to the file path validation.
* The commit `2ac3cd4f90b4df66874fab171376ca26868604c4` fixed the XSS vulnerability by adding sanitation to `REQUEST_URI`.
* The content from the pull request #27 confirms that the identified vulnerabilities were fixed and merged into the master branch.
