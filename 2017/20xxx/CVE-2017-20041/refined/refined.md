{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UC Browser for Android incorrectly displays the URL in the address bar when a specially crafted HTML page with a spoofed URL in the <title> tag is loaded.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "URL spoofing vulnerability due to improper handling of the <title> tag in the browser's address bar.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick users into believing they are visiting a legitimate website (e.g., google.com) while they are actually visiting a malicious one. This can lead to phishing attacks or other malicious activities, as users may be more likely to trust the displayed URL.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page with the spoofed URL in the <title> tag and induce the victim to open it in the UC Browser or Meizu browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and convince the victim to open this page using the vulnerable browser. The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the victim's device before the user opens the crafted webpage."
