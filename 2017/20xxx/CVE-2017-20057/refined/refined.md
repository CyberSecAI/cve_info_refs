Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper encoding of user-supplied data when displayed in various parts of the Elefant CMS administration backend and frontend. Specifically, the following fields are vulnerable to XSS:

*   Username
*   User profile fields (Name, Address, Address 2, City, Title, Company, About)
*   Page fields (Title, Menu Title, Window Title, Description, Keyword)
*   Content block title
*   Blog post title and tags
*   Custom fields component name parameter

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-provided input is stored and later displayed without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing malicious JavaScript to be executed when a user views the affected page. Multiple instances of persistent XSS are identified in different areas of the application, such as user profiles, version comparison, page/content blocks and blog posts
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A single reflected XSS is identified, where the malicious payload is injected through a URL parameter and executed on the client side when the page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   **Steal Cookies:** This could lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Inject JavaScript Keyloggers:** This would allow an attacker to capture user inputs, including passwords and other sensitive information.
*   **Bypass CSRF Protection:** By executing malicious scripts, an attacker could potentially bypass Cross-Site Request Forgery protections.
*   **Deface pages/content:** Injecting javascript that can alter the look and behaviour of web pages.
*   **Redirect users to malicious sites:** Through javascript, attackers can redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Remote
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation generally requires a user to visit a compromised page. The user interaction depends on which XSS vulnerability is targeted. For persistent XSS a user must visit a page with the malicious payload present (ex: Admin viewing a user list). The reflected XSS requires the user to be lured into clicking a specially crafted link.
*   **Authentication:** Most persistent XSS vulnerabilities require a user account on the system. Some vulnerabilities can only be exploited by users with special roles (editor).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **For Persistent XSS:**
    *   An attacker can register as a new user (since registration is open by default).
    *   An attacker needs to have the ability to modify user profiles, create pages, blocks or blog posts depending on the targeted vulnerability.
*   **For Reflected XSS:**
    * The attacker can craft a malicious URL
    * An attacker must be able to lure victim into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 09/05/2016 and was publicly disclosed on 02/02/2017.
*   The fix was released in version 1.3.13 of Elefant CMS.
