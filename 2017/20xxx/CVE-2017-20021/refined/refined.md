The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Solare Datensysteme Solar-Log devices, but none of them are specifically identified as CVE-2017-20021.  It includes the following vulnerabilities:

**1) Unauthenticated Download of Configuration including Device-Password**

*   **Root Cause:** The device exposes its configuration file containing the device password without requiring authentication.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated access to sensitive information (device password).
*   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the device can be gained without authentication.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a GET request to `/data/misc.dat`
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP GET requests to the device.

**2) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The device does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing modification of the password via crafted links.
*   **Vulnerability:** CSRF allows password modification or removal.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can take over the device by removing or modifying its password.
*  **Attack Vector:** Luring an authenticated user to click on a crafted link containing malicious POST request.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious URL, user interaction required.

**3) Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload**

*   **Root Cause:** The device allows unauthenticated file uploads through a crafted POST request.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated file upload.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload malicious content, host a website, or use the device as a file share.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/menu/d_debug_db.html`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the device.

**4) Information Disclosure (CVE-2001-1341)**

*   **Root Cause:** The device leaks sensitive network configuration details and information about the Beck IPC component.
*  **Vulnerability:** Information disclosure of network configuration, gateway, MAC address and  internal component details.
*   **Impact:** Sensitive information can be exposed.
*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing `/ChipCfg` via HTTP or by sending a UDP multicast packet.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests or UDP packets within the network.

**5) Unauthenticated Change of Network-Configuration**

*  **Root Cause:** The device's UDP configuration server does not require authentication.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated modification of the device's network configuration.
*  **Impact:** The attacker can reconfigure the device's network settings.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted UDP packet to port 8001.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to send UDP packets to the device and knowledge of the MAC address.

**6) Unauthenticated Denial of Service**

*   **Root Cause:** The device's UDP configuration server can be crashed with malicious packets
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** The device can be rendered unusable until a manual reboot.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending arbitrary UDP packets to the device via port 8001
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send UDP packets to the device.

**7) Potential Unauthenticated Reprogram of IPC@CHIP Flash Memory**

*  **Root Cause:** The device allows reprogramming of its flash memory over the network without authentication.
*   **Vulnerability:** Potential for unauthenticated flash memory reprogramming.
*   **Impact:** Could lead to Denial of Service or potentially a botnet of compromised devices.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted UDP packets similar to those used by the "CHIPTOOL" utility.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send UDP packets and knowledge of the required protocol.
