[+] Exploit Title: Responsive Filemanger <= 9.11.0 - Arbitrary File
Disclosure/Deletion
[+] Date: 7 Feb 2017
[+] Vulnerability and Exploit Author: Wiswat Aswamenakul
[+] Vendor Homepage: <http://www.responsivefilemanager.com/>
[+] Affected version: only tested on 9.11.0 and 9.7.3 (other versions
might be affected)
[+] Tested on: Ubuntu 14.04, PHP 5.5.9
[+] Category: webapps

[+] Description
Responsive filemanger is a PHP based file manager that make use of AJAX
technology. It has various useful features. One of them is copy/cut and
paste files. However, the copy/cut feature does not santize file name
that will be copied/cut. Therefore, it is possible for attackers to
copied/cut any files including PHP files and paste them to overwrite
existing image files. Then, the attackers could download the overwritten
image files to read the content of the copied/cut files. Moreover, for
the cut feature, it can cause the original files to be deleted as well.

[+] Exploit
1. Upload a normal image file (jpg, png, gif) to a server
2. Right click at any files, select copy and capture the request with
Burp Suite (or any local proxy)
3. Change parameter "path" to any file name that we would like to
download, for example, path=../filemanager/config/config.php

path=subdir/size.png
###

6. Download the image file uploaded in step 1, it will contain content
of the file specified in step 3

[+] Note (about another issue I found)
During this report, I found another separated issue with the attack
filtering that only check for "../" but not "..\" which can be used to
bypass all filters if the application runs on Windows server and reported
the issue to the owner as well. However, I found out that this issue was
found by a guy from hacktizen and detailed in following blog post
<http://hacktizen.blogspot.com/2016/06/responsive-filemanager-9102-directory.html>
So, the credit goes for the guy who firstly reported. Perhaps, the guy from
hackitizen did not contact the owner of responsive filemanger or there are
any problems with communication. Therefore, the issue remains unresolved.

[+] Timeline
- 02/01/2017: Contact Owner
- 05/02/2017: Patched version is available
- 07/02/2017: Public Advisory
