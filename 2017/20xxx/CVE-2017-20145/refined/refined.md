[+] Exploit Title: Responsive Filemanger <= 9.11.0 - Arbitrary File Disclosure/Deletion
[+] Vulnerability and Exploit Author: Wiswat Aswamenakul
[+] Affected version: only tested on 9.11.0 and 9.7.3 (other versions might be affected)
[+] Description
Responsive filemanger is a PHP based file manager that make use of AJAX technology. It has various useful features. One of them is copy/cut and paste files. However, the copy/cut feature does not santize file name that will be copied/cut. Therefore, it is possible for attackers to copied/cut any files including PHP files and paste them to overwrite existing image files. Then, the attackers could download the overwritten image files to read the content of the copied/cut files. Moreover, for the cut feature, it can cause the original files to be deleted as well.

[+] Exploit
1. Upload a normal image file (jpg, png, gif) to a server
2. Right click at any files, select copy and capture the request with Burp Suite (or any local proxy)
3. Change parameter "path" to any file name that we would like to download, for example, path=../filemanager/config/config.php
4. Go to any sub directory, right click at any files, intercept the request with burp, select "Paste to this directory"
5. Change parameter "path" to the image file uploaded in step 1, for example, path=subdir/size.png
6. Download the image file uploaded in step 1, it will contain content of the file specified in step 3

[+] Weaknesses
- The copy/cut feature does not sanitize file names, allowing for the inclusion of paths to arbitrary files.

[+] Impact
- Arbitrary file disclosure: Attackers can copy sensitive files, like config.php, and overwrite image files. By downloading the overwritten image, the attacker can read the content of the copied file.
- Arbitrary file deletion: Using the cut function, attackers can delete original files by copying them to a new location overwritting an existing image file.

[+] Attack vectors
- The attacker needs to have access to the file manager to use the copy and paste functionality.
- The attacker uses the copy/cut and paste functionality in the file manager, intercepting requests and manipulating the 'path' parameter to specify a target file.
- The attacker copies the target file over an existing image and then downloads that image to get access to the content of the target file.

[+] Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to be able to access the file manager interface and upload files.
- The attacker needs to be able to use a proxy to intercept and modify requests.
