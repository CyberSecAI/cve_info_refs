  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user input when authenticating as an administrator.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Authentication Bypass"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the admin login page and gain administrative access to the application. Additionally, an attacker can directly access other admin functions that would typically require login.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests to the admin login page and other admin functionalities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
