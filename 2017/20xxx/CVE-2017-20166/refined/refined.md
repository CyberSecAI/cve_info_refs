Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Ecto (a database wrapper for Elixir) handles queries with `nil` values in `Repo.get_by/2` and `Repo.get_by!/2` functions. Specifically, when a query clause includes a `nil` value, it bypasses the explicit `is_nil/1` check that Ecto normally requires for comparisons with `nil`. This behavior allows unexpected queries where a field is compared with `nil` without explicit intent, potentially leading to unintended data access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Implicit `nil` Comparison:** The core weakness is the implicit comparison of fields with `nil` values without the required `is_nil/1` check.
- **Bypass of Intended Query Behavior:** This behavior circumvents the intended query logic where comparisons with `nil` must be explicit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unintended Data Access:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious API requests. Specifically they could supply a `nil` value for a query parameter. This could force the application to execute a query that was not explicitly intended by the application developer by bypassing the check. For example, they could query for records with a token field set to `nil`, which might not be the intended query behavior, and return records that were not supposed to be returned.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Requests:**  The primary attack vector is through external API requests. By sending malicious JSON data with `nil` values for fields used in `Repo.get_by/2` or `Repo.get_by!/2`, an attacker can manipulate the query and potentially retrieve unintended data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Send API Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to make API requests to the application that utilizes Ecto.
- **Knowledge of Query Parameters:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the fields used in `Repo.get_by/2` or `Repo.get_by!/2` queries in the application.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in commit [8e1b378](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/commit/8e1b378a6f79b0f26495578e57f896d3361c808a) which aimed to add support for `nil` values, and then reverted in commit [db55b0c](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/commit/db55b0cba6525c24ebddc88ef9ae0c1c00620250) due to security implications.
- The issue is related to a pull request ([#2125](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/pull/2125)).
- The fix was implemented in Ecto version 2.2.1, reverting the commit that introduced the issue.
- The vulnerability was assigned the GHSA ID: GHSA-2xxx-fhc8-9qvq.
