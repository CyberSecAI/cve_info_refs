    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change arbitrary Contact Form Manager settings via CSRF. An attacker can inject malicious scripts via stored XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": "CSRF attacks can be performed by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage. XSS attacks are performed by injecting malicious scripts into the form settings.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into performing actions for CSRF. For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to inject data into the form settings, potentially via CSRF or exploiting other vulnerabilities."
