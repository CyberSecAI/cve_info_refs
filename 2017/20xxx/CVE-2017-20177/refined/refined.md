Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability was caused by a lack of sanitization of user-provided data, specifically the `userIP` parameter passed through the URL and the `user_email` on signup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability was an XSS issue. User IP addresses were being passed via URL parameters without proper sanitization. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the user info popup.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The code did not properly validate user input, which lead to XSS. Specifically, the `$_GET['userID']` was not sanitized and could allow for malicious values.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would execute in the context of the user's browser when they viewed the user info popup, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Malicious redirects.
    *   Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could manipulate the `userIP` parameter within the URL used to display the user info popup.
*   An attacker could inject malicious script in the `user_email` field during signup.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needed to be able to manipulate URL parameters or submit malicious data through the signup form.
*   The attacker would need to be a user of the application to trigger the vulnerability when viewing user info or create a new user using the signup form.

**Additional Details**

*   The fix involved removing the user IP from the URL parameters and retrieving it directly from the database instead, which prevents the vulnerability.
*   The `$_GET['userID']` parameter is also sanitized and cast to an integer.
* The email field `$_POST[user_email]` is also sanitized on signup.
