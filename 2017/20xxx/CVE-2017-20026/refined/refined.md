The provided content describes two XSS vulnerabilities in HumHub version 1.0.1 and earlier.

**Vulnerability 1: Reflected XSS**
*   **Root Cause:** The `UserSearch` parameter is vulnerable to reflected XSS when debug mode is enabled.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unsanitized user input in the `UserSearch` parameter. Additionally, the error page discloses all cookies and the contents of the `$_SERVER` array when debug mode is enabled.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can steal cookies, inject JavaScript keyloggers, or bypass CSRF protection by injecting malicious JavaScript. The disclosure of cookies, even httpOnly ones, and server array data, increases the impact.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `UserSearch[last_login]` parameter.
*  **Required Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a user to click on it, provided debugging is enabled on the HumHub instance.

**Vulnerability 2: DOM-based Self-XSS**
*   **Root Cause:**  A DOM-based self-XSS vulnerability exists within the "What's on your mind?" text box.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input sanitization in the "What's on your mind?" text box.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially execute JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account takeover or other malicious actions. The impact is considered low because it is a "self-XSS" and requires more user interaction.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user must paste a malicious string in the "What's on your mind" text box. This may be exploitable with clickjacking in some browsers.
*  **Required Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker would need to trick the user into pasting the crafted payload in the text box.

The advisory also notes that the vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.1 of HumHub.
