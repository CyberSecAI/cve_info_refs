{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UserSearch parameter is vulnerable to reflected XSS when debug mode is enabled. Additionally, there is a DOM-based self-XSS vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)",
    "DOM-based self-XSS"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can steal cookies, inject JavaScript keyloggers, or bypass CSRF protection.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the UserSearch parameter.",
    "Enticing a user to enter a malicious payload in the \"What's on your mind?\" text box."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload or trick a user into entering the payload in the text box. The application debug mode must also be enabled for the reflected XSS attack to work."
