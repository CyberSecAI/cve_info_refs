•  Axis devices with firmware 5.65 or lower

Axis devices with firmware 5.65 and lower utilize the Boa web server for web-interface and web-
related functionality. The web server in Axis devices is being primarily used in two scenarios:

•  For general purpose machine-to-machine communication between the Axis device and the
system it is connected to, usually a video management system that is accessing the Axis
device via API interfaces such as ONVIF and VAPIX.

•  For configuration and maintenance tasks performed by installers, administrators, and end

users.

The vulnerability has been assigned a 8.8 (High) severity by using the CVSSv3.1 scoring system.
Learn more about the Common Vulnerability Scoring System here.

Axis has released a patched firmware version that replaces the Boa web server with the Apache web
server completely. All Axis products with firmware version 5.70 or later will include the Apache
webserver and their frequent updates.

Example release notes for an Apache version update:
Updated Apache to version 2.4.54 to increase overall cybersecurity level.

It is recommended to update to the latest firmware version.

The latest AXIS firmware version can be found here. For further assistance and questions, please
