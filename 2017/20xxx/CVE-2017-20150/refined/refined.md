Based on the provided content, this commit addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities in a website. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The original code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Several PHP files (`Turinfo.php`, `Turtabel.php`, `adminindex.php`, `adminturnering.php`, `bordreservation.php`) were vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through GET and POST parameters. Attackers could manipulate these parameters to inject malicious SQL code into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, modify existing records, or delete data.
*   **Account Takeover:** If user credentials are stored, an attacker might be able to steal them and gain administrative access to the website.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could potentially modify the website content and deface it.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly mentioned, a SQL injection could lead to queries that consume significant resources, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameters:** Several files used `$_GET` to retrieve user inputs, such as `INFO`, `Turnering`, `Navn`, `Gametag`, `BordID`, `Turnavn`, `Dag`, `Tid`, `Desc`, and `pid`. These parameters were vulnerable to SQL injection if not properly sanitized before inclusion in database queries.
*   **HTTP POST Parameters:** Files like `bordreservation.php` used `$_POST` to get parameters like `ticketID`, and `playernamee` which were not initially sanitized against SQL injection.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** An attacker would need some knowledge of SQL syntax to construct malicious injection payloads.
*   **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker would need to access the website and manipulate GET or POST requests. No special privileges or position on the server would be required other than being able to send web requests.

**Specific Vulnerable Files and Changes:**

*   **`Turinfo.php`:**  The code now sanitizes the `$_GET['INFO']` parameter using `stripslashes()` and `mysqli_real_escape_string()` before displaying it and using it in a database query.
*   **`Turtabel.php`:**  Sanitizes `$_GET` parameters (`Turnering`, `Navn`, `Gametag`, `BordID`) using `stripslashes()` and `mysqli_real_escape_string()` before using them in SQL queries.
*   **`adminindex.php`:**  Sanitizes `$_POST` parameters (`forside1stor2`, `forside1`, `forside2stor`, `forside2`, `forside3stor`, `forside3`, `forside4stor`, `forside4`) using `stripslashes()` and `mysqli_real_escape_string()` before using them in SQL queries.
*   **`adminturnering.php`:** Sanitizes `$_GET` parameters (`Turnavn`, `Dag`, `Tid`, `Desc`) using `stripslashes()` and `mysqli_real_escape_string()` before using them in SQL queries.
*   **`bordreservation.php`:** Sanitizes `$_GET['pid']`, and `$_POST` parameters (`ticketID`, `playernamee`) using `stripslashes()` / `stripcslashes()` and `mysqli_real_escape_string()` before using them in SQL queries.
*   `indexBackend.php`: This file had code that created and dropped tables, which was removed.

**Summary of Remediation:**

The commit implements a common fix for SQL injection by using `stripslashes()` to remove backslashes and `mysqli_real_escape_string()` to escape special characters in user-provided input before using them in SQL queries. This prevents attackers from inserting their own SQL code and manipulating the database.

**Additional Notes:**
* The code changes aim to address SQL injection vulnerabilities by using `mysqli_real_escape_string` to sanitize inputs.
* There are multiple files modified to include sanitization to prevent injection.
