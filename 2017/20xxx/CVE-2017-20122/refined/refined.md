Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The contact form's "text" field, despite being captcha-protected, fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject and store malicious JavaScript code into the "text" field of the contact form. When other users view the stored content (e.g., through a webpage displaying the form data), the malicious script will execute in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through the contact form on the vulnerable Bitrix Site Manager.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted input into the "text" field of the contact form. No special privileges or specific location is needed, besides network access to the application. The attacker can use the provided payload `<img src="<http://1">; on onerror="$(’p').text(’Hacked’)" />` to trigger the vulnerability.
