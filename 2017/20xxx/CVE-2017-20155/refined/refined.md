Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-20155:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified in issue #11 and fixed in pull request #12 of the `Sterc/Analytics-dashboard-widget` repository, and thus matches the expected description of CVE-2017-20155.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of sanitization or proper encoding of data retrieved from Google Analytics, specifically, site search queries. User-submitted search queries containing JavaScript code were stored by Google Analytics, and then when the dashboard widget displayed this data, the JavaScript was executed in the context of the widget within the web application.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS because the malicious payload (JavaScript) is saved in Google Analytics and then retrieved and executed by the application's dashboard widget.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Output Encoding:** The application fails to sanitize or encode the data retrieved from Google Analytics before rendering it in the user interface, allowing the injected JavaScript to execute.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application's dashboard, which could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the application.
    *   **Malicious Actions:** Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the dashboard.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Internal Site Search:** An attacker would need to perform a search on the targeted site that included a malicious JavaScript payload. Google Analytics stores this query, which the vulnerable widget then retrieves and renders unsafely.
*   **Dashboard Widget:** The vulnerability exists within the Analytics Dashboard Widget which retrieves and displays the stored malicious search queries without sanitizing or encoding them.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Site User:** The attacker needs to be a user of the website that is being tracked with Google Analytics.
*   **Knowledge of JavaScript:** The attacker must be able to craft a valid JavaScript payload.
*   **No Special Access:** The attacker doesn't necessarily need any privileged access to the system besides being able to submit a search query on the tracked site.
