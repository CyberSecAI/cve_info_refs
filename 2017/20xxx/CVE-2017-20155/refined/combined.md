## Description

[![@gpsietzema](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/381017?u=54f8408f41733788fbea63624ff877c0f208c8e3&v=4&size=48)](/gpsietzema)[gpsietzema](https://github.com/gpsietzema)opened [on Mar 8, 2017](https://github.com/Sterc/Analytics-dashboard-widget/issues/11#issue-212747556)

It is possible to execute in-manager javascript when tracking internal site-search with Google Analytics. The javascript you search for will be saved by Google Analaytics. Which in turn will be read-out by the Dashboard Widget. Executing javascript would be possible here.
