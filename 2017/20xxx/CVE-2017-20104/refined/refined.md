  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient filtering of user-controlled input in the 'UWA_SID' cookie during the login process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Time-based blind SQL injection (CWE-89).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract information bit by bit by using the SLEEP function, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the web application, injecting SQL code into the 'UWA_SID' cookie.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send HTTP requests to the web application."
