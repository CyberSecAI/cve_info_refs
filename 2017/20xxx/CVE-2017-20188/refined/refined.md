The provided content relates to CVE-2017-20188.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that error messages in form fields were not properly sanitized before being added to the DOM. This allowed for the execution of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the error text, leading to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persistent XSS:** The error messages were stored without sanitization, allowing the injected script to be executed every time the error was displayed, which leads to a persistent XSS vulnerability.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize user-provided input (in this case, error messages) before rendering them in the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive user data (session cookies, etc.).
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a form field that would then be displayed as an error message by the application.
- This could be done via manipulating a form input that will cause an error message, in a way that the error message itself contains malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger an error message that allows them to inject code.
- This typically involves manipulating data submitted to the application to cause a validation or other type of error.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by HTML encoding the error message before adding it to the DOM using `AjxStringUtil.htmlEncode(message)`, which prevents the browser from interpreting it as executable code.
