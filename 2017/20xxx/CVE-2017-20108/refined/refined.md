{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Easy Table WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving plugin settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code in a targeted user's browser, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive information such as user credentials and personal data.",
  "Attack vectors": "Malicious input injected into the plugin settings page (options-general.php?page=easy-table) through parameters like shortcodetag, attrtag, class, width, border, align, limit, nl, terminator, delimiter, and escape.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin panel and manipulate the plugin's settings."
