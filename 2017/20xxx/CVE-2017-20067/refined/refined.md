The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Hindu Matrimonial Script" PHP application, but it **does not reference CVE-2017-20067**.

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The application has an authentication bypass vulnerability due to insecure login handling. By setting both the username and password fields to `'or''='`, the attacker can gain admin access. The application also seems to have other vulnerabilities like SQLi that are not clearly explained but are implied by the direct access to different PHP pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
*   **Authentication bypass**: Using `'or''='` in the username/password bypasses authentication.
*   **Direct access to admin pages**:  Admin functionalities can be directly accessed by entering the specific URL.
*  **Potential SQL Injection**: Implied by the note "Admin Login Bypass & SQLi + Add/Edit"

**Impact of exploitation**:
*   **Unauthorized administrative access**: An attacker can bypass the login and gain full administrative privileges.
*   **Modification of content/configuration**:  The attacker could add or modify information through direct access to admin functionalities (e.g., usermanagement, countrymanagement, settings, etc.).
*   **Potential database manipulation**: An attacker might be able to execute arbitrary SQL queries if SQLi vulnerability is exploited.

**Attack vectors**:
*   **Web interface**: The vulnerability is exploited through the web application's login page by manipulating the input parameters.
*   **Direct URL access**: Attacker directly accesses admin pages bypassing the navigation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
*   **Network access**: The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable paths**: The attacker needs knowledge of the admin login page and other admin URLs.
*  **Basic web attack knowledge**: Understanding of SQLi and how to input `'or''='` for bypass.
