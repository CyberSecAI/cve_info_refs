| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.7 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco ASA Software Internet Key Exchange Version 1 XAUTH Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20170419-asa-xauth  First Published: 2017 April 19 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuz11685](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz11685)     CVE-2017-6610     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.7](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2017-6610     CWE-399       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 1 (IKEv1) XAUTH code of Cisco ASA Software could allow   an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected   system.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software running on the following products:   + Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Cisco ASA for Firepower 9300 Series   + Cisco ISA 3000 Industrial Security ApplianceRefer to the “Fixed Software” section of this security advisory for more information about affected releases.      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is   configured to terminate remote access IKEv1 VPN connections using IPsec client and XAUTH is used for user authentication.       Cisco ASA Software is not affected by this vulnerability if the system   is configured to terminate the following VPN connections:   + Clientless SSL   + AnyConnect SSL   + Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) AnyConnect   + LAN-to-LAN VPN   + Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)-IPsec VPNTo determine whether a Cisco ASA Software appliance is configured to terminate IKEv1 remote access VPN   connections, a dynamic crypto map must be configured for at least one   interface. Administrators should use the **show running-config crypto map | include interface**|**dynamic** command and verify that the output includes a dynamic crypto map. The following example shows a crypto map named *outside\_map* configured on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto map | include interface|dynamic   crypto map outside_map 65535 ipsec-isakmp dynamic mydynamiccrypto map outside_map interface outside   ``` By default, remote access VPN using IPsec VPN clients use XAUTH for user authentication. Administrators can verify whether the VPN client is using XAUTH by using the **show running-config all tunnel-group  ipsec-attributes | include xauth** command and verifying that *ikev1 user-authentication xauth*is present. The following example shows a Cisco ASA Software appliance with a tunnel-group named *RAVPN* and with XAUTH configured: ```   ciscoasa# show  running-config all tunnel-group RAVPN ipsec-attributes | include xauth[...]ikev1 user-authentication xauth   ``` **Note**: Remote access VPN using an IPsec client is not configured by default; however, when configured, the XAUTH feature will be enabled.      **Determining the Running Software Release**      To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can use the **show version** command. The following example shows the results of the **show version** command on an appliance running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.2(1): ```   ciscoasa# show version | include Version   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1)    Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ``` Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html)  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**  In the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco ASA Software.
