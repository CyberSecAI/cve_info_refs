Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Specifically, the vulnerability is classified as CWE-399, which refers to a resource management error leading to a DoS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. This means the device becomes unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attacker needs to have low-level privileges (PR:L) to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction (UI:N) is required.
- The scope of impact is changed (S:C), implying that a vulnerability in one component can affect other components within the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the targeted device.
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate with the SNMP service.
- The attack complexity is high (AC:H).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases prior to the first fixed software release.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- The CVSS base score is 6.3
- CVSS vector string is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
