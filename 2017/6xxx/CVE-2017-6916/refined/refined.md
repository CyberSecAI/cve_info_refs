The content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in BigTree CMS.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF tokens in several features of the application, namely:
    *   Deleting registered users.
    *   Changing the Colophon information.
    *   Changing the Navigation Social links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Absence of CSRF protection mechanisms in the mentioned features.
    *   The application relies on the "Referrer" header for some CSRF protection, but it's insufficient and not applied to the vulnerable features.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions.
    *   Users can be deleted without their consent.
    *   Colophon information can be changed, potentially defacing the website.
    *   Navigation Social links can be modified to redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   CSRF attacks are conducted via malicious web pages or links, tricking a user into submitting a forged request while they are authenticated to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into accessing a malicious link or page.
    *   The attacker does not need direct access to the server, but needs to be able to send requests to it via the victim's browser
