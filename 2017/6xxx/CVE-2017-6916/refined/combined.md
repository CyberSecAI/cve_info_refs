## I. Abstract

As quoted from the official site of BigTree CMS, BigTree CMS is an open source content management system built on PHP and MySQL. It was created by – and for – user experience and content strategy experts. BigTree’s user system is designed for a single webmaster or large distributed teams. Users can be editors or publishers of a single page or the entire site.

## II. Introduction

### 2.1. Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Generally, CSRF is an attack that “forces” a user to do something that is basically “unwanted” in a web based application by utilizing the circumstance of the victim that is being authorized (login). In general, this kind of attack could be used because the absence of authentication process in doing a change or the absence of unique token that can allowed to process the related matter (the uniqueness of the token is usually given so the user wouldn’t be troubled by typing password to changes that are not quite significant).

In this situation, the problem related lack of CSRF token could be found at a few features such as Colophon Changing (like a feature to change a web footer easily), User Deletion, and Navigation Social Changing (changing the URL to the malicious one).

**Please kindly note**, as we learn a few things at BigTree CMS, **we found that the protection is given with the needs of “Referrer” header** of the HTTP/S Request. For example, when we tried to do a PoC of CSRF at the “Added User” Feature, the feature needs the “Referrer” parameter to “completely finishing” the PoC. But at those 3 (three) mentioned feature, the protection is not given yet.

### 2.2. Colophon Feature

In simple, this feature allows the users to write their own footer at the sidebar. By default, the value of Colophon is "Built on BigTree CMS" with embedded URL at the Product Name.

### 2.3. Nav-Soc Feature (Navigation Social)

The feature allows the users to put their own social network with the provided URL and logos to the sidebar that exist at the application.

## III. Summary of Issue

3.1. Deleting the Registered User (both of v.4.2.16 and v.4.1.18);

3.2. Change the Colophon Information (both of v.4.2.16 and v.4.1.18); and

3.3. Change the Navigation Social (both of v.4.2.16 and v.4.1.18).

## IV. Information and Situation of this PoC
