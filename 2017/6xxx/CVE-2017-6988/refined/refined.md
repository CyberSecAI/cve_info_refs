- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A certificate validation issue existed in EAP-TLS when a certificate changed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation in EAP-TLS when certificates are changed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious network with 802.1X authentication may capture user network credentials.
- **Attack vectors**:  A malicious network utilizing 802.1X authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be in a position to control the network to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. The attacker needs to be able to manipulate or change the certificates used for 802.1X authentication.
