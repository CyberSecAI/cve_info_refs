- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) software does not properly validate the source of WinAPI messages. Specifically, it lacks User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI), allowing messages from lower-integrity processes to be processed by the higher integrity SEP UI processes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Tamper Protection Bypass:** The lack of proper message validation allows an attacker to spoof messages to the SEP UI, bypassing the intended tamper protection mechanisms.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send a `WM_SYSCOMMAND` message with `SC_CLOSE` to the SEP UI, closing the interface and preventing the user from accessing the program.
    - **Message Spoofing/Integrity Compromise:** Arbitrary text can be injected into the UI using `SetWindowText` API call, misleading the user by presenting false messages and potentially undermining confidence in the product’s security.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - The user is unable to use the SEP UI, including the ability to initiate scans or check the status.
    - False information or arbitrary messages can be displayed in the SEP UI, potentially misleading the user about the system’s security status.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local: The attacker must be able to execute code on the targeted Windows machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to execute code locally on the target system. This could be achieved through various means such as malware, or if they have some level of access to the system.
