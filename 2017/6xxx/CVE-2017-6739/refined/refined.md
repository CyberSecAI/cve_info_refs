Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-6739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow when processing crafted SNMP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of the affected system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could also cause the affected system to reload/crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted SNMP packets via IPv4 or IPv6 to the affected device.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and does not require physical access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access (SNMPv3) or Community String (SNMPv1/v2c):**
    *   For SNMPv2c or earlier, the attacker needs to know the SNMP read-only community string.
    *   For SNMPv3, the attacker must have valid user credentials for the device.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the targeted device to send the malicious SNMP packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP (v1, v2c, and v3).
*   Multiple MIBs are affected, including `ADSL-LINE-MIB`, `ALPS-MIB`, `CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB`, `CISCO-BSTUN-MIB`, `CISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB`, `CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB`, `CISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIB`, `CISCO-VOICE-NUMBER-EXPANSION-MIB`, and `TN3270E-RT-MIB`. These MIBs are enabled by default when SNMP is enabled.
*   The advisory mentions that exploit code for this vulnerability (CVE-2017-6739) was published.
