Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6913:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a failure to properly filter event attributes within the HTML `<time>` tag in Open-Xchange OX App Suite's webmail. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious code, embedded within an email using HTML event attributes in the `<time>` tag, is stored on the server and executed when a user opens the email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they view the email. This can lead to:
    *   **Data theft:** Access and steal sensitive information like session cookies.
    *   **Account takeover:** Potentially hijack the user's session.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirect the user to a malicious site or trigger downloads of malicious software.
    *   **Phishing:** Display a fake login page to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Injection:** An attacker crafts a malicious email containing a `<time>` tag with various event attributes that contain JavaScript code, and sends it to the target.
*   **Target Interaction:** The victim opens the malicious email within the vulnerable webmail application, triggering the embedded JavaScript code in the `<time>` tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to users of the vulnerable Open-Xchange webmail application.
*   **Understanding of HTML and XSS:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of HTML and how to exploit XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **No special privileges:** The attack can be performed remotely without any special access to the target system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability arises because event attributes within the `<time>` tag, such as `onafterprint`, `onbeforeprint`, `onerror`, `onload`, `onclick`, etc. are not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code directly within these attributes.
*   The provided example demonstrates the injection of various event handlers, each containing `console.log` statements to illustrate the execution of the JavaScript code when the email is viewed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Open-Xchange AppSuite backend version `7.6.3-rev28` onwards.
*   The vendor assigned a CVSS score of 5.3 to this vulnerability: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
*   The researcher was awarded a $500 bounty for reporting this vulnerability.
