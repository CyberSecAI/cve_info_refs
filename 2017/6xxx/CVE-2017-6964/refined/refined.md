Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `dmcrypt-get-device` helper program, which is part of the `eject` package. This helper is a setuid-root binary designed to check if a given device is an encrypted device managed by `devmapper`. The program intends to drop privileges to a non-root user before parsing the data it retrieves from the kernel. However, the code failed to check the return values of the `setuid()` and `setgid()` system calls. If these calls failed, the program would continue to parse the data with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Dropping:** The core weakness is the lack of error checking after attempting to drop privileges using `setuid()` and `setgid()`.
*   **Setuid-Root Binary:** The `dmcrypt-get-device` helper runs with root privileges, making it a prime target for privilege escalation if vulnerabilities are present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. If either `setuid()` or `setgid()` failed, the program would continue as root and then parse data that's intended to be parsed as a normal user which means an attacker can control the data and gain root access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Execution of `dmcrypt-get-device`:** The attacker would need to somehow trigger the execution of the `dmcrypt-get-device` helper program, typically through the `eject` command, while causing the `setuid()` or `setgid()` calls to fail. The specifics of how to cause those calls to fail is not made clear.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Execute `eject`:** The attacker must be able to execute the `eject` command, which internally calls the vulnerable `dmcrypt-get-device` helper.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ilja Van Sprundel.
*   The fix involves adding error checks after the calls to `setuid()` and `setgid()` in the `dmcrypt-get-device.c` file.
*   The fix was applied to multiple versions of Ubuntu and Debian.
*   The `dmcrypt-get-device` helper was a non-upstream addition to the `eject` package.
*   There was some discussion about migrating to util-linux eject, which does not contain this extra code.
