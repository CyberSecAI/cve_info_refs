- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the `token` HTTP GET parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The `$_GET['token']` parameter is directly used in `GetAuthDetails.html.php` without sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `token` parameter of the URL. When a victim clicks on the crafted URL, the malicious script will be executed in their browser. This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `token` parameter. The attacker would send this crafted URL to a victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `token` parameter and convince the victim to click on it. This could be done via email, social media, or other communication channels.
