## Description

[![@jgj212](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1484292?v=4&size=48)](/jgj212)[jgj212](https://github.com/jgj212)opened [on Feb 10, 2017](https://github.com/paypal/merchant-sdk-php/issues/129#issue-206848154)

Hello:

I have find a Reflected XSS vulnerability in this sdk.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in “token” HTTP GET parameter that will be passed to “merchant-sdk-php\samples\AccountAuthentication\GetAuthDetails.html.php”. The infected source code is line 7, there is no protection on \_GET[‘token’]; if \_GET[‘token’] contains evil js code, line 21 will trigger untrusted code to be excuted on the browser side.

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1484292/22834995/2046b58c-eff2-11e6-9c13-b5c23ba47947.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1484292/22834995/2046b58c-eff2-11e6-9c13-b5c23ba47947.png)

So if a attacker construct a special url as follow and send it to a victim, when the victim click the url, the code which is contained in the url will be executed on the victim's browser side to do some evil.

"[http://localhost/php-pro/merchant-sdk-php-master/AccountAuthentication/GetAuthDetails.html.php?token=>](http://localhost/php-pro/merchant-sdk-php-master/AccountAuthentication/GetAuthDetails.html.php?token=%3E)<script>alert(1);</script>"

The follow scrrenshot is the result to click the upper url ( win7 spq x64 + firefox 51.0.1 32bit ):
