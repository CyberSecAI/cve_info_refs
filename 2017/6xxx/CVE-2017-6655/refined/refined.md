Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol implementation within Cisco NX-OS Software. Specifically, it's related to how the software handles certain conditions that cause an FCoE-related process to unexpectedly reload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a lack of proper handling of error conditions within the FCoE implementation, leading to an unexpected process reload and subsequent denial-of-service.
- Specifically, this appears to be related to a memory corruption issue (CWE-119)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This occurs when the FCoE-related process unexpectedly reloads.
- The vulnerability affects the availability of the device, potentially disrupting network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An adjacent attacker can exploit the vulnerability. This means the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
- The attack does not require authentication
- No user interaction is needed

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable device on the same network segment.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the device.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the device.
- The attacker does not require any user interaction

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects specific Cisco devices (Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 7000 and 7700 series switches) when configured for FCoE.
- There are no workarounds available, requiring a software upgrade to fix the issue.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing by Cisco.
