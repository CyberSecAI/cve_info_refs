Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6327:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of two flaws: an authentication bypass and a command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   The web interface uses the `user` attribute in the `JSESSIONID` cookie to determine if a session is authenticated.
    *   The `LoginAction.class` has public methods, accessible via unauthenticated web requests through the `/brightmail/action1.do?method=method_name` endpoint.
    *   The `LoginAction.notificationLogin` method decrypts a `notify` parameter (using a static password), creates a `UserTO` object from it (using the decrypted value as the email), creates a new session, and sets the `user` attribute of the session to the created user object.
    *   This allows an attacker to log in as any user (or create a new one) without proper authentication, by crafting an encrypted `notify` parameter.

2.  **Command Injection:**
    *   The `RestoreAction.performRestore` method takes `restoreSource` and `localBackupFilename` parameters.
    *   The `localBackupFilename` parameter is passed to the "bmagent" daemon, which then executes `/opt/Symantec/Brightmail/cli/bin/db-restore` with the parameter as an argument.
    *   The `db-restore` script contains a command injection vulnerability in a call to `/usr/bin/du` within a perl script, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can achieve **unauthenticated remote code execution as root.**
*   The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable system with root privileges by combining the authentication bypass and command injection flaws.
*   The attacker can gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   The attacker crafts a specific GET request to `/brightmail/action1.do?method=notificationLogin&notify=[encrypted_value]` to bypass the authentication mechanism. The encryption is done using a static password found in the application code.
2.  **Command Injection:**
    *   The attacker uses an authenticated session (achieved from the previous step) to send a crafted request to `/brightmail/admin/restore/action5.do?method=performRestore`, including a malicious `localBackupFileSelection` parameter.
    *   The malicious parameter injects commands into the `db-restore` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Symantec Messaging Gateway web interface.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests.
*   The attacker needs to know the encryption method used to generate a valid `notify` parameter, however, the encryption key is included in the code itself.
*   The attacker needs to craft the specific exploit parameters to chain the two vulnerabilities successfully and execute the arbitrary code.

In summary, the vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root due to an authentication bypass combined with a command injection vulnerability.
