Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6355

**Root Cause:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability in the `vrend_create_shader` function within the virglrenderer component.

**Vulnerability/Weakness:**
- The `pkt_length` and `offlen` parameters, which can be controlled by a malicious guest OS, are used in calculations without proper bounds checking.
- The calculation `pkt_length * 4 + sel->buf_offset` can result in an integer overflow, wrapping around to a small value.
- Subsequent `memcpy` operation uses the overflowed value, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) of the QEMU process. A malicious guest can trigger the integer overflow, causing the QEMU process to crash.
- Potential information disclosure, although not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds read/write operations can potentially expose sensitive host data.

**Attack Vector:**
- A malicious guest OS user/process triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user within a virtualized guest operating system with the ability to use the virglrenderer functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the parameters passed to the `vrend_create_shader` function, specifically `pkt_length` and `offlen` values, in order to trigger the integer overflow.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists due to lack of sufficient input validation and bounds checking in the `vrend_create_shader` function, specifically when calculating the memory region to copy shader data into.
- The fix involves adding explicit checks to ensure that integer overflows do not occur during the size calculation.
- The vulnerable code is in `src/vrend_renderer.c`
- The fix is in commit `93761787b29f37fa627dea9082cdfc1a1ec608d6`
