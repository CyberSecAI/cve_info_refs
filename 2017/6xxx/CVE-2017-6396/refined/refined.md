The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in "WPO-Foundation/webpagetest".

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the `pssid` HTTP GET parameter passed to `webpagetest-master/www/compare-cf.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `compare-cf.php` with a malicious script in the `pssid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and send it to a victim. The victim would then need to open the URL in their browser.

The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:
`http://localhost/.../WPO-Foundation_master/webpagetest-master/www/compare-cf.php?pssid=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22`
