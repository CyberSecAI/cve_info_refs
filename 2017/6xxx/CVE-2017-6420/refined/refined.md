Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds memory access within the `wwunpack` function in `libclamav/wwunpack.c`. This function is responsible for unpacking files compressed with the WWPack algorithm, often found in PE (Portable Executable) files. Specifically, the issue occurs when reading data from a specially crafted WWPack file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The `wwunpack` function attempts to read memory using offsets and sizes derived from the provided input file. Due to improper bounds checking, it can attempt to read beyond the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As seen from the ASAN crash log, the out-of-bounds read results in a crash of the ClamAV process.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that, in the worst case, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code. While not specifically detailed, this could stem from the initial memory corruption or by controlling the values that are being read.
*   **Other unspecified impacts:** The advisory also suggests there may be other unforeseen impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously crafted file:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file (e.g., a PE file containing a malicious WWPack section).
*   **File Scanning:** This file would be processed by ClamAV during a scan, triggering the vulnerability. This could be through a network share or via a web service that utilizes ClamAV for scanning uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to submit a file for scanning:** The attacker needs to be able to submit the malicious file to a system using ClamAV for scanning.
*   **No special privilege:** The vulnerability can be triggered by scanning, suggesting no special privileges are required to trigger this.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The provided commit log (`dfc00cd`) highlights the fix: adding checks using `CLI_ISCONTAINED` to ensure that memory access during unpacking is within the bounds of the allocated memory region for the WWPack section.
*   The ASAN (AddressSanitizer) crash log provides very detailed information on the specific function (`wwunpack`) and line number where the out-of-bounds read occurred. It also shows the call stack leading to the crash, indicating the flow of execution in ClamAV that leads to the vulnerable code. The ASAN output shows the freed memory region, the read attempt outside of the region and the call stack.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-6420 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `wwunpack` function of ClamAV. It can be triggered by scanning a crafted file containing malicious WWPack data, potentially leading to a denial of service and, in the worst-case, remote code execution. The vulnerability has been addressed by adding proper memory boundary checks.
