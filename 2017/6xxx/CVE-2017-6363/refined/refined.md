Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An invalid read occurs within the `tiffWriter` function in `gd_tiff.c`. This function is called by `gdImageTiffCtx` and `gdImageTiffPtr`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. The `tiffWriter` function attempts to read data from memory locations that are outside of allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The invalid read can lead to a crash or denial-of-service, as the program attempts to access memory it shouldn't. The Valgrind output shows the invalid reads occur at specific locations in the `tiffWriter` function, which could potentially be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted image file. In this case, a specific gd file format (`gdfile.gd`) is provided in the issue report that can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path within the libgd library.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported with a Valgrind output showing the invalid reads. The provided `gdfile.txt` file is the trigger, although it's not included in this analysis.
- The issue is present in the `gd_tiff.c` file, specifically in the `tiffWriter` function (lines 267, 268, 269), `gdImageTiffCtx` (line 446) and `gdImageTiffPtr` (line 1067).
- The issue is targeted to be resolved in milestone `GD 2.3.1`.
