Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6896:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the DIGISOL DG-HR1400 wireless router's use of a Base64 encoded session cookie value to determine user privileges. The router does not properly validate or authenticate the value present in this cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Session Management:** The router relies on a simple Base64 encoded string in a session cookie to define user roles, making it easily modifiable by an attacker.
- **Lack of Proper Authentication/Authorization:** The router fails to verify the authenticity of the session cookie or user role derived from it. It directly uses the provided value, trusting that it is legitimate.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user can gain administrative access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain full administrative access to the router by modifying the session cookie, which could lead to complete control of the device and potentially the network it serves.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, given the attacker has access to the router's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have remote access to its web interface.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests and cookies.
- **Knowledge of Base64 Encoding:** The attacker needs to understand how to base64 encode strings.
- **User Access:** Requires the user to log into the web interface as a non-admin user.

**Technical Details:**

1.  A normal user logs into the router, setting a cookie with a base64 value of "USER" ( `VVNFUg==`).
2.  An attacker can change this cookie to a base64 value of "ADMIN" ( `QURNSU4=`).
3.  Upon refreshing the page, the router will grant the attacker admin privileges as it validates the user roles based on the decoded value of the cookie.

**Affected Version:**

*   DIGISOL DG-HR1400 Wireless Router version 1.00.02 and below.
