Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-6799:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `view_type` parameter in the `view_filters_page.php` file. This parameter's value was directly outputted as a hidden input field without proper encoding, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes untrusted input (`view_type` parameter) and includes it in the HTML output without sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when they visit a crafted link. This can lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies, allowing for account hijacking.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Other malicious activities that can be performed using JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `view_type` parameter. This URL can be distributed via various methods like email, social media or embedded in other websites.
- The vulnerable parameter is submitted via GET or POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the MantisBT application.
- The attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking on the malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in version 2.1.0 of MantisBT due to a refactoring of the filter API where a line of code which ensured the variable only contained controlled text was removed.
- The fix involves replacing the direct output of the unsanitized `$f_view_type` variable with `$t_filter['_view_type']`, ensuring the value is properly handled by the filter API.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in MantisBT version 2.2.1.
