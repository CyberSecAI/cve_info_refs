Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `Expand3To4Module::run` function located in `SimpleModule.h` of the `audiofile` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The `Expand3To4Module::run` function writes data beyond the allocated heap buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A heap-based buffer overflow can lead to denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted audio file. The `sfconvert` tool, which is part of the audiofile library, can be used to trigger the vulnerability with a malicious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious audio file to an application that uses the vulnerable `audiofile` library.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The affected version is 0.3.6.
- The issue was reported to upstream on 2017-02-20.
- A reproducer is available at: `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00190-audiofile-heapoverflow-Expand3To4Module-run`.
- A patch for this vulnerability was included in a larger commit that addressed multiple ubsan crashes `https://github.com/mpruett/audiofile/pull/42`. This patch adds a check to ensure that the buffer size calculation does not overflow.

The provided information includes more details than what is typically available in a standard CVE description, including:
- Specific function and file where the vulnerability exists
- ASan output showing the overflow
- Reproducer
- Affected and fixed versions (although a specific fixed version is not mentioned, a patch is indicated.)
- The fact that the vulnerability was discovered via fuzzing.
- The root cause which is an out of bounds write.

The CVE ID mentioned in the blog post is **CVE-2017-6836**, matching the ID in the prompt.
