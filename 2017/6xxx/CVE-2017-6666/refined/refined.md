Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the forwarding component of Cisco IOS XR Software used in Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 5500 Series Routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A flaw exists in how the software handles traffic engineering (TE) tunnels.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to disrupt the forwarding of data traffic across these tunnels, causing a denial of service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- The router stops forwarding data traffic across Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to the router.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the system in a privileged mode.
