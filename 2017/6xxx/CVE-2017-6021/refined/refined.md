- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in Schneider Electric ClearSCADA. The software does not properly validate incoming data or command sequences.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an improper input validation issue (CWE-20) which allows an attacker to send specially crafted sequences of commands and data packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can cause the ClearSCADA server process and communication driver processes to terminate leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the ClearSCADA server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the ClearSCADA server and the ability to send crafted network packets. The attacker does not need any prior authentication or specific user interaction (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N).
