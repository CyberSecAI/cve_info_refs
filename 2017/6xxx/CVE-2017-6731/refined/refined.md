Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6731

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect error handling of an MSDP (Multicast Source Discovery Protocol) packet that contains an error in the packet header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper error handling in MSDP ingress packet processing.
- Specifically, the software does not correctly handle malformed MSDP packet headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the MSDP session to be unexpectedly reset, leading to a short denial of service (DoS) condition.
- The MSDP session will restart within a few seconds.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack over the network.
- The attacker sends a malformed MSDP packet to a targeted device with an established MSDP session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target device.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to construct a malformed MSDP packet.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
