- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DIGISOL DG-HR1400 wireless router is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The router does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to submit commands on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability due to lack of proper request validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain control of the router by submitting commands, including changing the SSID name, password, and security type.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker lures an authenticated user to visit a malicious webpage containing a crafted form that sends requests to the router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage and lure an authenticated user of the router to visit this webpage.
