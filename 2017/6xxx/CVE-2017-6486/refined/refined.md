Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which aligns with the general description of CVE-2017-6486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data within the "nyroModalSel" HTTP GET parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application fails to sanitize or properly encode the input provided through the `nyroModalSel` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to:
    *   Data theft (e.g., stealing cookies, session tokens)
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other malicious activities on the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `nyroModalSel` parameter in a GET request to the `reasoncms-master/www/nyroModal/demoSent.php` URL.
*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked, will inject the malicious script into the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious script in the `nyroModalSel` parameter.
*   The attacker must be able to trick a user into clicking on the malicious URL, typically through social engineering or by embedding the link in a website.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable file is `reasoncms-master/www/nyroModal/demoSent.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `nyroModalSel`.
*   The proof-of-concept (PoC) provided demonstrates a simple `alert(1)` JavaScript injection:
    `<http://localhost/.../reasoncms-master/www/nyroModal/demoSent.php?nyroModalSel=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22>`

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in reasoncms version 4.7 and likely exists in prior versions.
*   A fix was included in version 4.7.1, which addresses this security vulnerability in the NyroModal package.
