Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of insecure default credentials within the Cisco Ultra Services Framework Element Manager. This means that the software ships with a pre-configured username and password that are easily known or guessable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-255 (Credentials Management):** The primary weakness is the use of hardcoded or default credentials, which bypass normal access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain unauthorized access to the Cisco Ultra Services Framework Element Manager.
*   The attacker can potentially achieve limited confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts on the system.
    *   **Confidentiality:** The attacker can access sensitive information stored or processed by the Element Manager.
    *   **Integrity:** The attacker can modify the configuration or operation of the system, potentially causing misconfigurations or disruptions.
    *   **Availability:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the service availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (AV:N):** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Exploitation is not complex and does not require specialized expertise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileges Required (PR:L):** The attacker needs low-level access to the management network. The attacker must be able to access the management interface of the vulnerable system, however does not need elevated privileges.
*   The attacker needs to know or have obtained the default credentials.
*   The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable system.

**CVSS Score:**

*   **Base Score: 6.3 (Medium)**
*   **Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L**

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the use of default credentials in the Cisco Ultra Services Framework Element Manager. An attacker with network access to the management interface and knowledge of these credentials can log in and gain unauthorized access, potentially causing limited confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
