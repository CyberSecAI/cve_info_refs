Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-6632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the logging configuration of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) policies within Cisco FirePOWER System Software. Specifically, the issue arises when the software is configured to log connections using default actions of SSL policies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Excessive Resource Consumption: The logging process, when configured with default SSL policy actions, can lead to high consumption of system resources.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The excessive resource consumption caused by logging can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the affected FirePOWER system or Firepower Management Center (FMC) unresponsive or unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Network Access: The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the targeted FirePOWER System Software.
- No Authentication: The attacker does not require any privileges or valid credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco FirePOWER System Software that is configured to log connections using SSL policy default actions.
- The Firepower Management Center (FMC) can also be impacted as the logging events can flood the FMC causing a DoS condition.
- A workaround involves removing the policy default logging action from all SSL policies configured for a device.
- There is no indication of public exploitation of this vulnerability.
