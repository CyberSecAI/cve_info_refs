  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2017-6770",
    "details": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability involving the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Routing Protocol Link State Advertisement (LSA) database. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, allowing the attacker to intercept or black-hole traffic.",
    "affected_products": "Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS, Cisco IOS XE, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Cisco NX-OS Software configured for OSPF are vulnerable. Devices that do not have OSPF enabled are not affected by this vulnerability. OSPFv3 is not affected by this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by the processing of a crafted LSA type 1 packet which does not require acknowledgement and can originate from a spoofed IP address. This causes a targeted router to flush its routing table and propagate the crafted LSA update throughout the OSPF area.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can take full control of the OSPF Autonomous System (AS) domain routing table, allowing the attacker to intercept or black-hole traffic. This may lead to false routes injected into the OSPF routing table, traffic sent to a black hole, or traffic redirected to a destination that is controlled by an attacker.",
     "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by targeting the OSPF multicast address or directly targeting OSPF-enabled interfaces using crafted unicast or multicast LSA type 1 packets.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to determine a number of factors, such as the network placement and IP address of the target router, LSA DB sequence numbers, and the router ID of the OSPF Designated Router (DR). An attacker needs to know all of the factors in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
     "additional_information": "Exploiting the vulnerability on a Cisco Nexus device will not affect the local routing table of a Cisco Nexus device. However, the Cisco Nexus device will install and propagate the crafted LSA to other devices in the OSPF area."
