Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-6765:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the web-based management interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can conduct an XSS attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.
- Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser session. This could lead to:
    -  Data theft (e.g., session cookies)
    -  Defacement of the web interface
    -  Redirection to malicious sites
    -  Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, network-based attack vector (AV:N)
- The attacker exploits the vulnerable web-based management interface.
- The attacker would likely need to craft a malicious payload, and get the victim to interact with the interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N)
- Requires User interaction (UI:R) - the user must interact with the malicious script somehow, through the web interface

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1. The vector string is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
- The scope is changed (S:C), meaning that a successful exploit may impact other components beyond the vulnerable one.
- The confidentiality and integrity impacts are low (C:L, I:L). Availability is not impacted (A:N).
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- There are no workarounds available to address the vulnerability, and the solution involves upgrading to a patched software release.
