# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[`21e3728`](/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/21e3728a825c41ab41efa75e664108051bb9665e)

This is a security release :

*Those using `AuthType oauth20` together with applications that interpret headers set by mod\_auth\_openidc on paths that disclose sensitive information are affected and should upgrade.*

**Security**

* scrub headers for `AuthType oauth20`

On accessing paths protected with `AuthType oauth20` no headers would be scrubbed before mod\_auth\_openidc sets its own headers, so malicious software/users could set `OIDC_CLAIM_` and `OIDCAuthNHeader` headers that applications would interpret as set by mod\_auth\_openidc **only if** those headers are not set and overwritten by mod\_auth\_openidc itself.

**Bugfixes**

* handle `OIDCUnAuthAction` after max session duration is exceeded; see #220; thanks [@phybros](https://github.com/phybros)
* fix parse `OIDCOAuthTokenExpiryClaim`; closes #225; thanks Alessandro Papacci
* correctly parse `kid` in `OIDCPublicKeyFiles` and `OIDCOAuthVerifyCertFiles`; thanks Alessandro Papacci

**Other**

* improve logging wrt. session management availability; closes #223
* handle only `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` as non-browser request; closes #228; thanks [@mguillem](https://github.com/mguillem)
* improve error message on state timeout; closes #226; thanks [@security4java](https://github.com/security4java)
* a call to the refresh hook now also resets the session inactivity timeout

**Packaging Notes**

* *Accompanying libcjose packages can be found in the 2.1.3 release*
* *Ubuntu Wily packages can also be used on Xenial and Yakkety*
* *Centos 6 RPMs depend on `libhiredis-0.12` now e.g. from <https://pkgs.org/centos-6/puias-unsupported-x86_64/>*

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

Please use this new fedpkg update template when submitting the update:  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1425356,1425350,1425353,1428855  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [CVE-2017-6059](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-6059), [CVE-2017-6062](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-6062), [CVE-2017-6413](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-6413)  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1425356#c3)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-11-16 19:22:58 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 25 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '25'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 25 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1425356#c4)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 18:12:53 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life.

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

12/09/2024- release 2.4.16.6
12/05/2024- metadata: fix caching of JWKs from jwks\_uri when using the default expiry setting (i.e. not using OIDCJWKSRefreshInterval) and avoid fetching JWKs from the jwks\_uri for each user login; also addresses Redis cache error entries the log [ERR invalid expire time in 'setex' command]- avoid segfault and improve error reporting in case apr\_temp\_dir\_get fails when a temp directory cannot be found on the system upon initalizing cache mutexes and file cache; see #1288; thanks @ErmakovDmitriy
11/21/2024- add option to set local address for outgoing HTTP requests; see #1283; thanks @studersi using e.g. SetEnvIfExpr true OIDC\_CURL\_INTERFACE=192.168.10.2- try and address metris cleanup segmentation fault on shutdown; see #1207 by not flushing metrics to the shared memory segment upon exit
11/14/2024- allow specific settings Strict|Lax|None|Disabled for OIDCCookieSameSite in addition to On(=Lax)|Off(=None) - fix: default behaviour Lax - fix: apply OIDCCookieSameSite Off/None properly to state cookies instead of always setting Lax - re-introduces the option to configure a Strict SameSite session cookie policy, which will turn the initial Lax session cookie - set upon receving the response to the Redirect URI - into a Strict session cookie immediately after the first application request - allows for a "Disabled" value that does not set any SameSite flag on the cookies, in which case a browser falls back to its default browser behaviour (which should be Lax by spec)
11/07/2024- info: fix requests to the info hook with extend\_session=false; see #1279; thanks @fnieri-cdp - properly reflect the (unmodified) inactivity timeout in the response ("timeout") - avoid refreshing an access token (since the session is not saved) - avoid refreshing claims from the user info endpoint, and possibly refreshing the access token

10/16/2024- release 2.4.16.5
10/04/2024- ensure backwards compatibility with versions <2.4.16.x when a JSON array of string values is provided in the "aud" claim of the ID token; required by (at least) Oracle IDCS see #1272 and #1273; thanks @lufik and @tydalforce- add OIDCIDTokenAudValues configuration primitive that allows for explicit (and exhaustive) configuration of the list of accepted values in the "aud" claim of the ID token e.g. as required for passing FAPI 2 conformance testing- bump to 2.4.16.5rc0
09/29/2024- release 2.4.16.4
09/27/2024- correct usage of free() for json\_dumps return values instead of cjose\_get\_dealloc()()- use compact encoding and preserve order where appropriate for most calls to json\_dumps- replace json\_dumps/free combos with oidc\_util\_encode\_json- refactor oidc\_jwk\_to\_json- bump to 2.4.16.4rc3
09/26/2024- fix oidc\_jwk\_copy wrt. "x5t", which broke private\_key\_jwt authentication to Azure AD since 2.4.13 see #1269; thanks @uoe-pjackson- bump to 2.4.16.4rc2
09/21/2024- refactor state and userinfo

06/06/2024- add OIDCDPoPMode [off|optional|required] primitive- store the token\_type in the session
06/05/2024- add "nbf" claim in the Request Object as per https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1\_0-final.html#rfc.section.5.2.2
06/04/2024- add (client) support for RFC 9449 OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)- replace multi-provider .conf "issuer\_specific\_redirect\_uri" boolean with "response\_require\_iss" boolean- tighten up the "aud" claim validation in ID tokens- add support for the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile https://openid.net/specs/fapi-2\_0-security-profile-ID2.html
05/30/2024- add support for RFC 9126 OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests
04/23/2024- disable support for the RSA PKCS v1.5 JWE encryption algorithm as it is deemed unsafe due to the Marvin attack and is removed from libcjose as well
04/05/2024- add debug printout for OIDCUnAuthAction expression evaluation
04/03/2024- when an expression is configured for OIDCUnAuthAction (i.e. in the 2nd argument), also apply it to OIDCUnAutzAction so that it can be used to enable step-up authentication for SPAs with non-conformant browsers (some versions of Safari) and in (potentially insecure) iframes see #1205; thanks @ryanwilliamnicholls 04/02/2024- major rewrite of config primitive handling: - split out over different files, use header files consistently - encapsulate config record with getters/setters - allow overriding defined global configuration primitives to their default value on the individual vhost level - apply input/boundary checking on all configuration values, shared with provider metadata parsing - various fixes to applying default config values and allowing primitives in vhost/directory scopes- return HTTTP 502 when refreshing acces token or userinfo fails (default: "502\_on\_error")- use a singleton token refresh mutex- add support for OIDCOAuthIntrospectionEndpointKeyPassword- bump to 2.4.16dev
04/01/2024- release 2.4.15.7
03/29/2024- fix OIDCUserInfoRefreshInterval, interval seconds would be interpreted as microseconds
03/14/2024- fix userinfo refresh interval parsing; closes #1200; thanks @HolgerHees avoid refreshing userinfo on each request until access token expiry- store interval as JSON integer in session- use SameSite=Lax when OIDCCookieSameSite is On (also by default) instead of Strict as overriding from Lax to Strict does not work reliably anymore (Chrome)- release 2.4.15.6
03/13/2024- fix compilation without libhiredis; closes #1195 ; thanks @HolgerHees conditionally define oidc\_set\_redis\_connect\_timeout- fix `OIDCPassClaimsAs environment` bug introduced in 2.4.15.4; see #1196; thanks @HolgerHees- release 2.4.15.5
03/12/2024- release 2.4.15.4- fix setting the default PCKE method to "none" in a multi-provider setup- bump to 2.4.15.5dev
03/11/2024- avoid warning about setting a self-provided default value in the provider config
03/07/2024- OIDCProviderSignedJwksUri: accept verification key set formatted as either JWK or JWKS see #1191; thanks @psteniusubi- properly handle parse errors in Require claim integer statements
03/06/2024- add support for JSON real and null value matching in Require claim statements- fix evaluation Require statements for nested array claims- refactor handle/authz.c
03/04/2024- refactor integer and timestamp handling- fix default HTTP short retry interval setting- accept 0 in OIDCUserInfoRefreshInterval- userinfo refresh: don't try to refresh the access token and retry when a connectivity error has occurred- logout: don't try to revoke tokens on post-access-token-refresh or post-userinfo-refresh-errors logouts
03/01/2024- accept strings as well as integers in the "expires\_in" claim from the token endpoint- fix for "expires\_in" string values returned from the token endpoint that would be interpreted as 0 this fixes using OIDCRefreshAccessTokenBeforeExpiry or OIDCUserInfoRefreshInterval with (older) Azure AD configs that would result in a token refresh on every request since 2.4.15 or a 401 in 2.4.14.4- fix setting the "exp" claim in userinfo signed JWTs (exp would be now+0) when no expires\_in is returned by the OP- fix signed JWT caching when ttl set to 0 or "" which should apply the exp claim as the cache ttl
02/29/2024- hash the cache key if it is larger than 512 bytes so large cache key entries (i.e. for JWT tokens) are no longer a problem in unencrypted SHM cache configs, i.e. the default shared memory cache setup; see issues/discussions on "could not construct cache key since key size is too large" this is relevant for OAuth 2.0 RS configs with JWT access tokens and OpenID Connect RP configs where OIDCRefreshAccessTokenBeforeExpiry/OIDCUserInfoRefreshInterval is set and a JWT refresh token is returned- fix debug printout of cache key in oidc\_cache\_get
02/28/2024- optimize performance by skipping JSON processing when `OIDCPassClaimsAs none` is set
02/25/2024- implement oidc\_util\_apr\_hash\_clear so clearing hashtables works with older versions of libapr - refactor/extract HTTP functions
