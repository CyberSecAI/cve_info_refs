      "status": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The `mod_auth_openidc` module did not properly sanitize HTTP headers when the `AuthType oauth20` directive was used, leading to potential bypass of authentication.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper input sanitization",
          "Insufficient header scrubbing"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could bypass authentication and potentially gain access to sensitive information by sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious `OIDC_CLAIM_` and `OIDCAuthNHeader` headers.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious headers.",
            "The vulnerability could be triggered remotely by exploiting a configuration where the module is used to protect resources."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application or resource protected by `mod_auth_openidc`.",
          "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when the module is configured with `AuthType oauth20`. In this configuration,  headers like `OIDC_CLAIM_*` and `OIDCAuthNHeader` are not properly sanitized by mod_auth_openidc, which allows attackers to inject malicious content in the headers, potentially leading to authentication bypass and access to sensitive data. The fix implements header scrubbing to remove malicious or unexpected headers before mod_auth_openidc sets its own headers. This prevents malicious software or users from setting headers that applications would then interpret as being set by the module itself. This issue was addressed in `mod_auth_openidc` version 2.1.6"
