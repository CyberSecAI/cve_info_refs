Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6347:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ip_cmsg_recv()` function within the Linux kernel's IPv4 networking stack. This function calculates the IP checksum for ancillary data being received. The issue is that the sk\_buff (socket buffer) passed to `ip_cmsg_recv()` might not be linear, particularly when sending UDP packets over loopback with `MSGMORE`. The function was using `csum_partial()` which operates on a contiguous memory region. When used on a non-linear `sk_buff`, it could lead to an incorrect checksum calculation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect checksum calculation:** Using `csum_partial()` on a non-linear `sk_buff` leads to a calculation error that affects the IP checksum.
- **Potential Information Leak:** The incorrect checksum may cause the function to read kernel memory, which may then be sent as part of the packet. This leads to an information leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting network packets that force the use of the `ip_cmsg_recv` with non-linear `sk_buff`s. This could lead to:
- **Incorrect data handling:** The incorrect checksum might cause the receiver to handle the data incorrectly
- **Information Disclosure:** Kernel memory could be exposed as part of the packet through the faulty checksum mechanism.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted UDP packets over loopback with the `MSGMORE` flag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a vulnerable system. In the described scenario, using loopback suggests the attacker may be on the local system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix replaces `csum_partial()` with `skb_checksum()` which handles non-linear `sk_buff`s correctly.
- The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel 4.0 and was fixed in 4.10.1
- The issue was detected by the syzkaller team.
- Red Hat states that this issue does not affect RHEL 4,5,6,7 or MRG-2.
