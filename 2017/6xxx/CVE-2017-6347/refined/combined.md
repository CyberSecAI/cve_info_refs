xfs: clear delalloc and cache on buffered write failure
commit fa7f138ac4c70dc00519c124cf7cd4862a0a5b0e upstream.
The buffered write failure handling code in
xfs\_file\_iomap\_end\_delalloc() has a couple minor problems. First, if
written == 0, start\_fsb is not rounded down and it fails to kill off a
delalloc block if the start offset is block unaligned. This results in a
lingering delalloc block and broken delalloc block accounting detected
at unmount time. Fix this by rounding down start\_fsb in the unlikely
event that written == 0.
Second, it is possible for a failed overwrite of a delalloc extent to
leave dirty pagecache around over a hole in the file. This is because is
possible to hit ->iomap\_end() on write failure before the iomap code has
attempted to allocate pagecache, and thus has no need to clean it up. If
the targeted delalloc extent was successfully written by a previous
write, however, then it does still have dirty pages when ->iomap\_end()
punches out the underlying blocks. This ultimately results in writeback
over a hole. To fix this problem, unconditionally punch out the
pagecache from XFS before the associated delalloc range.

rtlwifi: rtl\_usb: Fix for URB leaking when doing ifconfig up/down
commit 575ddce0507789bf9830d089557d2199d2f91865 upstream.
In the function rtl\_usb\_start we pre-allocate a certain number of urbs
for RX path but they will not be freed when calling rtl\_usb\_stop. This
results in leaking urbs when doing ifconfig up and down. Eventually,
the system has no available urbs.

block: fix double-free in the failure path of cgwb\_bdi\_init()
commit 5f478e4ea5c5560b4e40eb136991a09f9389f331 upstream.
When !CONFIG\_CGROUP\_WRITEBACK, bdi has single bdi\_writeback\_congested
at bdi->wb\_congested. cgwb\_bdi\_init() allocates it with kzalloc() and
doesn't do further initialization. This usually works fine as the
reference count gets bumped to 1 by wb\_init() and the put from
wb\_exit() releases it.
However, when wb\_init() fails, it puts the wb base ref automatically
freeing the wb and the explicit kfree() in cgwb\_bdi\_init() error path
ends up trying to free the same pointer the second time causing a
double-free.
Fix it by explicitly initilizing the refcnt to 1 and putting the base
ref from cgwb\_bdi\_destroy().

ACPICA: Linuxize: Restore and fix Intel compiler build

ACPICA commit b59347d0b8b676cb555fe8da5cad08fcd4eeb0d3
The following commit cleans up compiler specific inclusions:
Commit: 9fa1cebdbfff3db8953cebca8ee327d75edefc40
Subject: ACPICA: OSL: Cleanup the inclusion order of the compiler-specific headers
But breaks one thing due to the following old issue:
Buidling Linux kernel with Intel compiler originally depends on acgcc.h
not acintel.h.
So after making Intel compiler build working in ACPICA upstream by
correctly using acintel.h, it becomes unable to build Linux kernel using
Intel compiler as there is no acintel.h in the kernel source tree.
This patch releases acintel.h to Linux kernel and fixes its inclusion in
acenv.h.

netfilter: nf\_ct\_helper: warn when not applying default helper assignment
commit dfe75ff8ca74f54b0fa5a326a1aa9afa485ed802 upstream.
Commit 3bb398d925 ("netfilter: nf\_ct\_helper: disable automatic helper
assignment") is causing behavior regressions in firewalls, as traffic
handled by conntrack helpers is now by default not passed through even
though it was before due to missing CT targets (which were not necessary
before this commit).
The default had to be switched off due to security reasons [1] [2] and
therefore should stay the way it is, but let's be friendly to firewall
admins and issue a warning the first time we're in situation where packet
would be likely passed through with the old default but we're likely going
to drop it on the floor now.
Rewrite the code a little bit as suggested by Linus, so that we avoid
spaghettiing the code even more -- namely the whole decision making
process regarding helper selection (either automatic or not) is being
separated, so that the whole logic can be simplified and code (condition)
duplication reduced.

goldfish: Sanitize the broken interrupt handler
commit 6cf18e6927c0b224f972e3042fb85770d63cb9f8 upstream.
This interrupt handler is broken in several ways:
- It loops forever when the op code is not decodeable
- It never returns IRQ\_HANDLED because the only way to exit the loop
returns IRQ\_NONE unconditionally.
The whole concept of this is broken. Creating devices in an interrupt
handler is beyond any point of sanity.
Make it at least behave halfways sane so accidental users do not have to
deal with a hard to debug lockup.

x86/platform/goldfish: Prevent unconditional loading
commit 47512cfd0d7a8bd6ab71d01cd89fca19eb2093eb upstream.
The goldfish platform code registers the platform device unconditionally
which causes havoc in several ways if the goldfish\_pdev\_bus driver is
enabled:
- Access to the hardcoded physical memory region, which is either not
available or contains stuff which is completely unrelated.
- Prevents that the interrupt of the serial port can be requested
- In case of a spurious interrupt it goes into a infinite loop in the
interrupt handler of the pdev\_bus driver (which needs to be fixed
seperately).
Add a 'goldfish' command line option to make the registration opt-in when
the platform is compiled in.
I'm seriously grumpy about this engineering trainwreck, which has seven
SOBs from Intel developers for 50 lines of code. And none of them figured
out that this is broken. Impressive fail!

USB: serial: ftdi\_sio: fix line-status over-reporting
commit a6bb1e17a39818b01b55d8e6238b4b5f06d55038 upstream.
FTDI devices use a receive latency timer to periodically empty the
receive buffer and report modem and line status (also when the buffer is
empty).
When a break or error condition is detected the corresponding status
flags will be set on a packet with nonzero data payload and the flags
are not updated until the break is over or further characters are
received.
In order to avoid over-reporting break and error conditions, these flags
must therefore only be processed for packets with payload.
This specifically fixes the case where after an overrun, the error
condition is continuously reported and NULL-characters inserted until
further data is received.

USB: serial: ftdi\_sio: fix extreme low-latency setting
commit c6dce2626606ef16434802989466636bc28c1419 upstream.
Since commit 557aaa7ffab6 ("ft232: support the ASYNC\_LOW\_LATENCY
flag") the FTDI driver has been using a receive latency-timer value of
1 ms instead of the device default of 16 ms.
The latency timer is used to periodically empty a non-full receive
buffer, but a status header is always sent when the timer expires
including when the buffer is empty. This means that a two-byte bulk
message is received every millisecond also for an otherwise idle port as
long as it is open.
Let's restore the pre-2009 behaviour which reduces the rate of the
status messages to 1/16th (e.g. interrupt frequency drops from 1 kHz to
62.5 Hz) by not setting ASYNC\_LOW\_LATENCY by default.
Anyone willing to pay the price for the minimum-latency behaviour should
set the flag explicitly instead using the TIOCSSERIAL ioctl or a tool
such as setserial (e.g. setserial /dev/ttyUSB0 low\_latency).
Note that since commit 0cbd81a9f6ba ("USB: ftdi\_sio: remove
tty->low\_latency") the ASYNC\_LOW\_LATENCY flag has no other effects but
to set a minimal latency timer.

ptr\_ring: fix race conditions when resizing
[ Upstream commit e71695307114335be1ed912f4a347396c2ed0e69 ]
Resizing currently drops consumer lock. This can cause entries to be
reordered, which isn't good in itself. More importantly, consumer can
detect a false ring empty condition and block forever.
Further, nesting of consumer within producer lock is problematic for
tun, since it produces entries in a BH, which causes a lock order
reversal:
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
consume:
lock(&(&r->consumer\_lock)->rlock);
resize:
local\_irq\_disable();
lock(&(&r->producer\_lock)->rlock);
lock(&(&r->consumer\_lock)->rlock);
produce:
lock(&(&r->producer\_lock)->rlock);
To fix, nest producer lock within consumer lock during resize,
and keep consumer lock during the whole swap operation.

ip: fix IP\_CHECKSUM handling

```
The skbs processed by ip_cmsg_recv() are not guaranteed to
be linear e.g. when sending UDP packets over loopback with
MSGMORE.
Using csum_partial() on [potentially] the whole skb len
is dangerous; instead be on the safe side and use skb_checksum().

Thanks to syzkaller team to detect the issue and provide the
reproducer.

v1 -> v2:
 - move the variable declaration in a tighter scope

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

> ip: fix IP_CHECKSUM handling
>
> The skbs processed by ip_cmsg_recv() are not guaranteed to
> be linear e.g. when sending UDP packets over loopback with
> MSGMORE.
> Using csum_partial() on [potentially] the whole skb len
> is dangerous; instead be on the safe side and use skb_checksum().
>
> Thanks to syzkaller team to detect the issue and provide the
> reproducer.

The issue was introduced in 4.0 by commit ad6f939ab193. The fix as
well backported to 4.9.13.

ip: fix IP\_CHECKSUM handlingThe skbs processed by ip\_cmsg\_recv() are not guaranteed to
be linear e.g. when sending UDP packets over loopback with
MSGMORE.
Using csum\_partial() on [potentially] the whole skb len
is dangerous; instead be on the safe side and use skb\_checksum().
Thanks to syzkaller team to detect the issue and provide the
reproducer.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1427984#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-03-01 16:14:44 UTC  ```  The skbs processed by ip_cmsg_recv() are not guaranteed to be linear e.g. when sending UDP packets over loopback with MSGMORE. Using csum_partial() on [potentially] the whole skb len is dangerous; instead be on the safe side and use skb_checksum().  Upstream patch:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ca4ef4574f1ee5252e2cd365f8f5d5bafd048f32>  References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/525>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1427984#c1)  Fedora Update System    2017-03-03 03:50:18 UTC  ``` kernel-4.9.13-100.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.
