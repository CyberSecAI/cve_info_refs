  "CVE-2017-6507": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in AppArmor before 2.12. Incorrect handling of unknown AppArmor profiles in AppArmor init scripts, upstart jobs, and/or systemd unit files allows an attacker to possibly have increased attack surfaces of processes that were intended to be confined by AppArmor. This is due to the common logic to handle 'restart' operations removing AppArmor profiles that aren't found in the typical filesystem locations, such as /etc/apparmor.d/. Userspace projects that manage their own AppArmor profiles in atypical directories, such as what's done by LXD and Docker, are affected by this flaw in the AppArmor init script logic.",
    "root_cause": "The AppArmor init scripts, upstart jobs, and systemd units incorrectly handled the 'restart' operation by removing profiles that were not located in the standard profile directories (e.g., /etc/apparmor.d/).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect logic for handling AppArmor profile removal during service restarts or package upgrades.",
      "Lack of awareness of non-standard profile locations managed by third-party applications."
    ],
    "impact": "Processes intended to be confined by AppArmor could become unconfined, potentially leading to increased attack surfaces and unauthorized access or actions within the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Restarting the AppArmor service via init script, upstart job or systemd unit.",
	  "Upgrading the AppArmor package."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would either need to trigger an apparmor service restart through normal system administration (init script, upstart job, or systemd unit), or trigger an apparmor package upgrade."
