Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2017-6547:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The `httpd` service in ASUSWRT firmware has a flawed check in the `handle_request` function. It checks if the requested filename's length exceeds 50 characters. If it does and the filename does not contain "findasus" or "acme-challenge", it constructs a redirect URL with the filename which is directly injected into a `<script>` tag within the response, without proper sanitization.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability caused by the lack of sanitization of the filename before embedding it into a script tag within the redirection response.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the router's web interface context.
   - This can lead to various attacks such as:
     - Session hijacking: Stealing user cookies.
     - UI manipulation: Altering web interface appearance or functionality.
     - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
     - Performing actions on the router on behalf of the user.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
   - The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a URL with a filename longer than 50 characters containing the malicious JavaScript payload.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This could be a user on the local network or an attacker with external access if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet (which is generally discouraged).
   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerable code snippet is:

```c
if(strlen(file) > 50 &&!(strstr(file, "findasus")) && !(strstr(file, "acme-challenge")))
{
    char inviteCode[256];
    snprintf(inviteCode, sizeof(inviteCode), "<script>location.href='/cloud_sync.asp?flag=%s';</script>", file);
    send_page( 200, "OK", (char*) 0, inviteCode, 0);
```

   - The PoC URL provided is:
     `http://192.168.1.1/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA';alert('XSS');'A`
     This URL demonstrates how to trigger the XSS vulnerability by injecting the `alert('XSS')` payload into the response.

**Additional Notes:**
  - The provided content also details two additional vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-6549 (Session Stealing) and CVE-2017-6548 (Remote Code Execution). However these are separate vulnerabilities and are not relevant to the description of CVE-2017-6547.

This information is more detailed than the general CVE description, including the vulnerable code snippet, a working PoC, and the affected component.
