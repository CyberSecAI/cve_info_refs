Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the WebLaunch functionality of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is a cross-site scripting flaw. This means that the software doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in a web context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web interface.
- Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser when they interact with the vulnerable web page. This could potentially lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Information theft (e.g. cookies)
  - Defacement
  - Redirecting the user to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable system.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker doesn't require any prior access or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required: The attack requires the victim to interact with the malicious payload usually by clicking a link or opening a crafted webpage, meaning this is not automatically exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the affected Cisco AnyConnect WebLaunch interface.
- Ability to craft a malicious URL or other input that can be injected into the web interface.
- Ability to induce a user of the affected software to interact with the malicious payload.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **CVSS Score:** 6.1 (Medium)
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  - **AV:N (Attack Vector: Network):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
  - **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** Exploitation is relatively easy.
  - **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
  - **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** User interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
  - **S:C (Scope: Changed):** An exploit can affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.
  - **C:L (Confidentiality Impact: Low):** Limited impact on confidentiality.
  - **I:L (Integrity Impact: Low):** Limited impact on integrity.
  - **A:N (Availability Impact: None):** No impact on availability.

**Additional Notes:**
- No workarounds are available.
- The vulnerability was reported by an external researcher.
