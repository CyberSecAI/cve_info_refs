Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-6779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of maximum size restriction on certain system log files within Cisco collaboration products. This allows the log files to grow uncontrolled, consuming excessive disk space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Size:** The core weakness is the absence of a limit on the size of specific system log files, allowing them to grow indefinitely.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted remote connection requests that cause excessive logging, indicating a lack of proper input validation or sanitization of these requests leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Successful exploitation leads to high disk utilization, eventually exhausting available disk space.
*   **Application Instability:** The lack of disk space can cause applications to malfunction, potentially rendering the affected appliance unstable and unusable.
*   **Abnormal Operation:** The DoS condition can cause the appliance's functionality to operate abnormally.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attack vector is remote, utilizing network connection requests.
*   **Crafted Remote Connection Requests:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically crafted remote connection requests to the affected appliance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable appliance to send the crafted requests.

**Additional details:**

*   **Affected Products:**  The vulnerability affects a wide range of Cisco collaboration products, particularly those based on Cisco Voice Operating System (VOS), including Emergency Responder, Finesse, Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment, MediaSense, Prime License Manager, SocialMiner, Unified Communications Manager (UCM), Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service, Unified Communication Manager Session Management Edition (SME), Unified Contact Center Express (UCCx), Unified Intelligence Center (UIC), Unity Connection, Virtualized Voice Browser. Additionally, it affects Prime Collaboration Assurance and Prime Collaboration Provisioning.
*  **Indicators of Compromise:** The error message  `./hssi_defines.sh: line ###: echo: write error: No space left on device` in device logs may indicate exploitation of this vulnerability.
*   **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
