  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in io-ico.c when calculating State->HeaderSize.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (segmentation fault and application crash). The vulnerability can cause an out-of-bounds read of the BIH variable, leading to a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted ICO file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious .ico file to the application using the gdk-pixbuf library.",
	"details": "The vulnerability is in the `io-ico.c` file, specifically in the calculation of `State->HeaderSize`. This value is calculated by adding `entry->DIBoffset` and `INFOHEADER_SIZE`. `entry->DIBoffset` is read directly from the input data. When compiled with optimization flags such as `-O1 -fstrict-overflow -ftree-vrp` or higher, an integer overflow can occur. This overflow bypasses the subsequent check (`State->HeaderSize < 0`) intended to prevent it. As a result, an out-of-bounds read occurs when accessing the BIH variable, causing a segmentation fault. The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating `entry->DIBoffset` in the crafted ICO file."
