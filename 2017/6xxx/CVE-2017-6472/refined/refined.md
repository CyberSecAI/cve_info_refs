Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the RTMPT dissector within Wireshark. A malformed packet can cause the dissector to enter an infinite loop, leading to excessive memory consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The RTMPT dissector fails to handle certain malformed packets correctly, resulting in an infinite loop.
- **Memory Consumption:** The infinite loop leads to uncontrolled memory usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The excessive memory consumption can cause Wireshark to crash.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can effectively cause a denial-of-service condition by crashing Wireshark.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed RTMPT packet onto the network.
- **Malformed Packet Trace File:** An attacker can convince a user to open a malformed packet trace file (.pcap) containing the malicious RTMPT packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to inject network packets (if targeting live capture).
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker might need to trick a user into opening a malicious pcap file (if targeting file analysis).
