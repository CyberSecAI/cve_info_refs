```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Heap-based buffer overflow in the `MSADPCM::decodeBlock` function.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  A heap-based buffer overflow occurs when decoding MSADPCM audio data.
- Impact of exploitation:  Denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution through the processing of a malformed audio file.
- Attack vectors: Processing a specially crafted audio file using the `audiofile` library.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to provide a malicious audio file to be processed by a vulnerable application using the `audiofile` library.
