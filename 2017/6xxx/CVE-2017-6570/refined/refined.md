Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Mail-Masta WordPress plugin:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the failure to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. The plugin directly incorporates GET and POST parameters into SQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple files and parameters. This occurs because the code uses `$_GET` and `$_POST` parameters directly within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Unauthenticated and Authenticated Vulnerabilities:**  Some vulnerabilities are present in files accessible without authentication (e.g., `csvexport.php`), while others require WordPress admin privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the WordPress database, including user information, email lists, and other confidential data managed by the plugin.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to gain administrative access by manipulating admin-related tables/queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

The vulnerabilities can be exploited through the following:

*   **GET Parameters:**  Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the following GET parameters: `list_id` (in `csvexport.php`), `filter_list` (in `view-list.php`, `add_member.php`, and `edit_member.php`), and `id` (in `view-campaign-list.php`, `view-campaign.php`,  `edit-list.php` and `campaign-delete.php`).
*   **POST Parameters:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `camp_id` POST parameter in `count_of_send.php` and `list_id` in `campaign_save.php` and `subscriber_list.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Vulnerabilities:** For files like `csvexport.php`, the attacker does not need any special privileges and can exploit the vulnerability directly.
*   **Authenticated Vulnerabilities:** For files under the `wp-admin` directory and other specific files, an attacker would need to have access to the WordPress admin panel to exploit these vulnerabilities. This means they would need to either compromise a valid admin account or have already gained access through other vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerable Code Examples:**

*   **`csvexport.php` (Unauthenticated):**
    ```php
    $list_id=$_GET['list_id'];
    $check_sql = "SELECT * FROM $mail_subscribers WHERE list_id = $list_id";
    ```
*  **`view-list.php` (Authenticated):**
    ```php
    $list_id = $_GET['filter_list'];
    $listdata = $wpdb->get_results( $wpdb->prepare("SELECT * FROM $masta_list WHERE list_id= $list_id",$query));
    ```
*   **`count_of_send.php` (Authenticated):**
    ```php
    $camp_id=$_POST['camp_id'];
    $count=$wpdb->get_results("SELECT count(*) co from  $masta_reports where camp_id=$camp_id and status=1");
    ```
*  **`campaign_save.php` (Authenticated):**
    ```php
   $list_id=$_POST['list_id'];
   $check_list = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT count(id) FROM wp_masta_subscribers where list_id=$list_id");
    ```
*  **`subscriber_list.php` (Authenticated):**
    ```php
   $check_sql = "SELECT * FROM $mail_subscribers WHERE list_id = $list_id and email = '$email'";
    ```

In all these cases, the variables taken from `$_GET` and `$_POST` are directly inserted into SQL queries without sanitization, which makes them vulnerable to SQL injection.

The provided content gives good details about the vulnerable files and parameters, along with code examples, that confirm the existence of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
