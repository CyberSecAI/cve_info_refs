Based on the provided information, here's an analysis related to CVE-2017-6877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the ability of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files to contain embedded JavaScript code. The application, Lutim, did not properly handle SVG uploads, allowing the execution of the malicious script within the context of the Lutim domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS.  By uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing JavaScript, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the user's browser when the SVG is viewed. This is due to insufficient sanitization or handling of uploaded SVG files.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or properly process uploaded SVG files, allowing the embedded JavaScript to execute.
- **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** Because the SVG file is hosted on the same domain as the Lutim application, the malicious script can access local storage data of the Lutim application, leading to further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could steal sensitive information stored in the browser's localStorage, including filenames, view URLs, delete URLs, send dates, and expire dates of uploaded images.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete data related to the user's uploads in Lutim (by using the exposed delete URLs).
- **Account Compromise:** In some cases, XSS can lead to more serious consequences, such as session hijacking and account compromise.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Potentially, the attacker can perform any action the user can within the context of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file through the application's upload functionality.
- **User Interaction:** The user views the uploaded SVG file in their browser which triggers the execution of the embedded malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the Lutim application.
- **Malicious SVG Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious SVG file containing the necessary JavaScript payload.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open/view the malicious SVG file after upload.

**Additional details from the provided content**
- The provided commit message "Force download if image is SVG" suggests a fix implementation to mitigate the identified XSS issue by forcing download instead of rendering SVG files within the browser.
- The vulnerability discussion mentions that the localStorage stores data for uploaded files and is accessible from the malicious SVG file hosted on the same domain.
- The discussion references a third-party source explaining XSS vulnerabilities in SVG files.
- The discussion suggests different workarounds, including disabling SVG uploads, forcing downloads, filtering, converting to bitmap format, and disabling localStorage.
