{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Symantec Messaging Gateway product's backupNow.do endpoint takes several user inputs and passes them to an internal service responsible for executing operating system commands. One of the user inputs, specifically the remote backup path, is passed to the service without proper validation, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection vulnerability. Insufficient validation of user-supplied input before passing it to the system command execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user can execute arbitrary terminal commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user, which is root. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the 'backupNow.do' endpoint. An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application, and they need to send a crafted POST request to the 'performBackupNow.do' endpoint, including a malicious payload in the 'remoteBackupPath' parameter. This crafted parameter injects arbitrary system commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the web interface of the Symantec Messaging Gateway. They need to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints and they need access to a SSH server to leverage the vulnerability."
