Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-6367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located in the gSOAP module used by Cerberus FTP Server. A buffer overflow occurs due to improper handling of input when processing HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, triggered by sending a long string in the "Host" header of an HTTP request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, causing the Cerberus FTP server to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based Attack: The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP request to the server via the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Cerberus FTP server.
- Sending Raw Sockets: The attacker needs the ability to send crafted TCP packets, which involves setting up a socket connection to the target server.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit code provided demonstrates the vulnerability. It sends a "GET" request with a very long "Host" header value consisting of 5004 "A" characters, followed by the hostname and port. This excessively long Host header triggers the buffer overflow in the gSOAP module of the Cerberus FTP server, leading to a crash.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was discovered on 2017-02-27 and the vendor released a patch by 2017-03-02.
