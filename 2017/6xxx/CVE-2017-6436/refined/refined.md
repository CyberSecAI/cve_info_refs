Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6436:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `parse_string_node` function within `bplist.c`. Specifically, a crafted plist file could lead to an attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory which can result in a memory allocation error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Allocation Error:** The `parse_string_node` function attempts to allocate memory based on a size value read from the plist file. If this size is maliciously crafted to be excessively large, it can trigger a memory allocation failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The memory allocation error will lead to a crash of the application attempting to parse the crafted plist file.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Plist File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a maliciously crafted plist file to the affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The Debian Security Advisory mentions that the vulnerability is exploitable by local users and the issue description suggests an attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file.
