{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The help pages of SAP BusinessObjects Financial Consolidation are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) because the frameset.htm page can be requested with JavaScript code as part of the parameters. The parameters are then written into the 'src' attribute of an 'iframe' tag using JavaScript. While there is filtering based on regular expressions, this filter can be bypassed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to the execution of malicious JavaScript code, loading external malware, or tricking users into entering their credentials on a malicious page.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "GET request with malicious JavaScript code in parameters",
      "Malicious link redirecting users to the vulnerable page",
      "Embedding the vulnerable page as an iframe in a malicious website"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website containing the vulnerable application in an iframe. The attacker needs to craft a specific URL with malicious javascript to be injected via the vulnerable parameter."
