The provided content relates to a fix for issue #1947 in the concrete5-legacy repository. This commit specifically addresses a vulnerability related to the `search_dialog.php` file.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the direct use of the `$_REQUEST` variable when constructing a hidden input field in the `search_dialog.php` file, specifically regarding `ocID` and `disable_choose`. This allows an attacker to control these values and potentially inject malicious data into the generated HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The original code uses `$_REQUEST['ocID']` and `$_REQUEST['disable_choose']` directly in the HTML, without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious Javascript code into the `ocID` or `disable_choose` parameters, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser when the page is loaded, due to the lack of proper escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the HTML of the `search_dialog.php`, which can then be executed within a victim's browser. This could lead to various attacks, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credential theft
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Modifying the content of the webpage
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker can manipulate the `ocID` and/or `disable_choose` parameters in the URL when the `search_dialog.php` is called.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the parameters passed to the `/web/concrete/tools/files/search_dialog.php` script.
*   The attacker must be able to construct a URL that includes the malicious payload.

**Fix:**

The fix implemented in the commit `2b16399ce3e962a8c27fb3ec14bc8e855d65b63a` addresses this vulnerability by using the sanitized variables `$ocID` and `$disable_choose` which have been encoded with `Loader::helper('text')->entities()` instead of the raw `$_REQUEST` values.

**Changes in the commit:**

*   The code now sanitizes `$_REQUEST['ocID']` and `$_REQUEST['disable_choose']` with `Loader::helper('text')->entities()` and stores them in `$ocID` and `$disable_choose` variables.
*   The hidden input field now uses these sanitized variables.

The commit addresses the XSS vulnerability and ensures that user input used to build HTML output is properly encoded.
