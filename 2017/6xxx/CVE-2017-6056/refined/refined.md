Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6056:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2017-6056. The description of the vulnerability, "a programming error in the processing of HTTPS requests in the Apache Tomcat servlet and JSP engine may result in denial of service via an infinite loop," is consistent across the various sources.

**2. Root Cause:**
A programming error in the Apache Tomcat servlet and JSP engine's handling of HTTPS requests. Specifically, the issue arises from the fix of CVE-2016-6816 being backported without the fix for Tomcat bug 57544. This combination makes it easy to trigger an infinite loop. 

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The core vulnerability is a flaw in the logic of how Tomcat processes certain HTTPS requests, leading to an infinite loop within the server's processing threads.
The backporting of CVE-2016-6816 without the fix for bug 57544 made it trivial to trigger the infinite loop issue from 57544.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The affected Tomcat server instance's CPU utilization will spike to 100% on one or more cores, effectively rendering it unresponsive to legitimate requests. In multi-core environments, multiple requests are required for all CPUs to be maxed out.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is via sending specially crafted HTTPS requests to a vulnerable Tomcat server. A specific vulnerability is that sending an HTTPS-GET request to the port used for HTTP-connections can trigger the DoS.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not need authentication, and can be remote.  An attacker needs the ability to send HTTPS requests to a vulnerable Tomcat server. Even restricting access to the HTTP connector doesn't stop an attacker from exploiting this bug. 
The issue is triggered by specific malformed HTTPS requests, leading to a server processing loop. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
