Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of the `$key` variable in the `Db::update` function within `inc/lib/Db.class.php`. Specifically, the code constructs an SQL query using the unescaped `$key` value in the `SET` clause of the `UPDATE` statement: `$set .= "`$key` = '$val',"`. Since `$key` is derived from user-controlled input (`$_POST['order']`), an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query via this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw due to improper handling of user input in the construction of an SQL query.
-  **Lack of input sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or escape the `$key` variable before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially manipulate database contents, including modifying, deleting, or adding data, depending on the database permissions of the application's user.
-   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database by injecting SQL queries designed to extract data.
-  **Arbitrary code execution (potentially):** In some cases, depending on the database configuration and permissions, a sophisticated attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server through the SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request. The attacker manipulates the `order` parameter in the request to inject malicious SQL code.
-   **Specifically, `order[0][id`%3D1 and (select * from (select(if(ascii(substr((select user()),1,1))%3D114,sleep(3),0)))a) and `name]=superfish` is used in the POST request.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web application.
-   **Authentication:** It is implied that the attacker needs to be logged in to access the vulnerable functionality, as a token is required.
-   **Understanding of the Application:** The attacker needs knowledge of the web application's structure and the vulnerable POST parameters.

**Additional Details from Content (Compared to Generic CVE Description):**

-   **Specific Code Location:** The content provides the exact file and line numbers where the vulnerability exists (`inc/lib/Control/Backend/menus.control.php`, `inc/lib/Menus.class.php`, `inc/lib/Db.class.php`).
-   **Detailed Code Snippets:** The content includes code snippets of the vulnerable functions, allowing for a more in-depth analysis of the vulnerability.
-   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A working PoC is provided showing how to exploit the vulnerability. The specific POST parameters used in the attack are provided.
-   **Specific vulnerable parameter:** The vulnerable parameter within the POST request `order[0][id`%3D1 and (select * from (select(if(ascii(substr((select user()),1,1))%3D114,sleep(3),0)))a) and `name]` is identified.

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific code, attack vector details, and a PoC, which makes it very useful for understanding and addressing the vulnerability.
