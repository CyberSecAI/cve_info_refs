Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6911

**Vulnerable Product:** USB Pratirodh

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application stores sensitive information, specifically usernames and password hashes, in an XML file named `usb.xml`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive authentication data (usernames and password hashes) in a plain XML file. This is not a secure method to handle credentials, even if they are hashed, as it makes them readily accessible.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The storage method allows for information disclosure, as the file is likely accessible to users with physical access to the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Compromise:** An attacker with physical access can read the `usb.xml` file and obtain username and password hashes.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Compromised credentials can be used to bypass the authentication mechanisms of USB Pratirodh, allowing unauthorized access to USB storage devices.
*   **Further Attacks:** The attacker could modify the `usb.xml` file to insert their own credentials, create backdoor accounts, or manipulate the configuration of USB access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the system where USB Pratirodh is installed. An attacker would need to gain access to the file system in order to read or modify the vulnerable `usb.xml` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the computer where the USB Pratirodh software is installed.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker must also have sufficient privileges to access the file system to read or modify the `usb.xml` file.
