# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

file using Vim or gVim, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Vim users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/vim-8.0.0386"

```

All gVim users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/gvim-8.0.0386"

```

| [Description](#c0)  gentoo@andyebling.plus.com    2004-08-19 11:21:59 UTC  ``` I have a PS/2 keyboard connected to a Belkin 4 port SOHO KVM, which is connected to my G5 via USB - this arrangment works perfectly with OS X, however when I boot from the latest LiveCD, the keyboard works at the boot prompt (where you typically select a kernel to boot, but is unresponsive when the root prompt eventually comes up.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hold down Opt+Cmd+O+F during boot to enter open firmware and enter password 2. select CDROM 3. boot LiveCD with default image (i.e. pressing enter at the boot: prompt) 4. once system is up, typing at the root prompt produces no output. Actual Results:   system did not respond to keyboard input - I had to hard reset.  Expected Results:   accepted keyboard input in the normal way, allowing me to proceed with an install of gentoo.  I will try and dig my original Apple USB keyboard out of the loft later on and see if I can reproduce the  bug with a keyboard directly connected to my G5.  system details:  dual G5 @2GHz, PS/2 microsoft natural keyboard, belkin 4 port SOHO KVM with the G5 connected on  the third port.  Switching to another port and back did not clear the problem.  I guess this bug could technically be classed as a blocker since I can't currently install gentoo, but since  not everyone is going to experience it, I'll put it as major for now. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tom Gall (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-19 21:32:28 UTC  ``` interesting issue.  Where there any messages from the USB layer complaining about it not being able to talk to the keyboard? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  gentoo@andyebling.plus.com    2004-08-28 11:42:45 UTC  ``` OK, I went to try and reproduce this, but interestingly, I can't actually get into open firmware (by pressing opt+cmd+o+f) or select a custom boot volume (by pressing opt) using the PS/2 keyboard connected through the KVM anymore - this _used_ to work.  Despite this fact, the PS/2 and KVM combination work fine the rest of the time when the system is booted into OS X.  I reset nvram in the course of removing the open firmware passward, but this did not help.  I managed to boot from the liveCD by plugging in the supplied Apple USB keyboard into the front USB port in order to select a custom boot volume, then removed the keyboard while waiting at the boot: prompt.  Again the PS/2 keyboard was unresponsive when bootup had completed, but if I plugged the USB keyboard back in again, I could type commands OK.  I checked dmesg and couldn't see an obvious error messages, but I'm concious I should be looking the absence of an initialisation message rather than an error message per se??  I'm afraid I'm not familiar with PPC linux, or USB with Linux for that matter  (my 6+ years of experience is PC based without USB) - so I'm not completely sure what I should be looking for here.  If you can tell me which device to use to mount a USB flash card reader, then I can transfer dmesg here if that would help.   ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Philippe Trottier (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-06 11:36:22 UTC  ``` One good question is, did it work with any other Linux distro or gentoo-ppc, if so then a copy of the .config would really help. If it never worked with any other linux, then there is probably no drivers, or the USB serial number and company number aren't registered... so if you can check the USB information from OSX in system profiler, it would also help ... ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tom Gall (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-31 07:52:32 UTC  ``` Is there any status update on this, especially with the 2004.3 livecds as well as using the suggestions in the comments of this bug?   ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Tom Gall (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-10 19:44:26 UTC  ``` given the lack of status updates from the reporter, closing this bug. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  gentoo@andyebling.plus.com    2004-11-14 00:07:49 UTC  ``` confirmed fixed with 2004.3 livecd. ``` |  |
