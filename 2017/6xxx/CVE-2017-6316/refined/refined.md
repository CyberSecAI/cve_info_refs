Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6316

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in Citrix CloudBridge (first exploit) and Netscaler SD-WAN (second exploit). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data in cookies before passing it to a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:**  The `CAKEPHP` cookie in the first case and `CGISESSID` cookie in the second case are vulnerable. By injecting shell commands into the cookie values, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the data provided in the `CAKEPHP` and `CGISESSID` cookies before using it in system calls, making command injection possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server.
- **Full System Compromise:** The provided exploits demonstrate the possibility to gain root access via command injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP request with a specially crafted `CAKEPHP` cookie in the first exploit, and `CGISESSID` cookie in the second exploit.
- **HTTP POST Request:** A POST request is sent to specific endpoints (`/cgi-bin/login.cgi?redirect=/` for CloudBridge and `/global_data/` for SD-WAN) along with the malicious cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests, including setting cookie values, to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **No Authentication Required:** These vulnerabilities are pre-authentication, meaning no valid credentials are required to exploit them.

**Additional Information:**
- The second exploit provides a Metasploit module, demonstrating a more concrete way to exploit the vulnerability, including how to upload and execute a payload.
- The second exploit targets Netscaler SD-WAN version <= 9.1.2.26.561201
- The first exploit targets Citrix CloudBridge.
