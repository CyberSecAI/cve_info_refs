    {
      "cve": "CVE-2017-6076",
      "details": "The release notes for wolfSSL version 3.10.2 mention a low-level buffer overflow vulnerability when loading a malformed temporary DH file. The report came from Yueh-Hsun Lin and Peng Li from KNOX Security, Samsung Research America.",
      "impact": "Buffer overflow leading to potential crash or arbitrary code execution.",
       "attack_vectors": "Loading a malformed temporary DH file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow vulnerability"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to load a malformed DH file. This could be via a network protocol, or a local file.",
       "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is described as a 'low level fix', suggesting that it is less severe than the medium level fix that was addressed in the same release."

    {
      "cve": "CVE-2017-6076",
       "details": "The release notes for wolfSSL version 3.10.2 mention a medium-level vulnerability related to the processing of OCSP responses. If OCSP is used without hard fault enforcement and no alternate revocation checks like OCSP stapling, an update is recommended.",
      "impact": "Potential issues related to certificate revocation if OCSP responses are not handled correctly. Could result in the acceptance of revoked certificates, and ultimately, a compromise of the security of the TLS connection.",
       "attack_vectors": "OCSP response processing.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of OCSP responses"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the OCSP response if the system is configured with OCSP enabled and without hard fault enforcement or OCSP stapling.",
      "additional_notes": "It is recommended to update if OCSP is used without hard faults enforced and no alternate revocation checks like OCSP stapling"

      "cve": "CVE-2017-6076",
      "details": "The release notes for wolfSSL version 3.10.2 mention a low-level vulnerability related to a potential cache attack on RSA operations. This vulnerability only affects server implementations where other users could monitor the cache.",
      "impact": "Potential cache timing attacks that could reveal sensitive information about RSA keys used by the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "Cache monitoring during RSA operations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cache-timing vulnerability in RSA operations"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to monitor the cache of the server where wolfSSL RSA is being used. This typically would involve shared hosting or similar server environments.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is described as a 'low-level fix', suggesting it might be less critical than the medium-level OCSP fix, but it requires an adversary to have access to the cache of the server."
