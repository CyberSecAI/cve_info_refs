{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `recover2.cgi` script allows resetting all account passwords using a predictable secret key derived from the device's MAC address.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure password reset mechanism",
        "Exposure of password reset functionality via web interface",
        "Reliance on a publicly accessible MAC address for security"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can reset all account passwords on the device, leading to complete loss of confidentiality and control.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the device's web interface.",
        "Knowledge of the device's MAC address, obtainable via ARP requests on the same subnet."
       ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be on the same subnet as the device and have the ability to send network requests. They must also be able to calculate the MD5 hash and create the URL for the password reset"
    },
    {
    "root_cause": "The login.cgi script processes both POST and GET requests, and concatenates username and password into a single parameter. The script also translates %20 back to \" \" (space).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unconventional parameter processing that doesn't distinguish between GET and POST requests",
        "Password can be passed within the username parameter."
      ],
       "impact": "While this login vulnerability itself isn't exploitable, it is an unusual implementation.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "Web interface access to the login.cgi endpoint via both GET and POST requests"
       ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the login page"
    },
    {
      "root_cause": "The device includes a vendor backdoor account with a known password that cannot be changed through the administrative web interface.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Hardcoded credentials",
        "Lack of ability to change credentials via web interface",
        "Unnecessary existence of a backdoor account"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker could use this backdoor account to gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to complete control over the device via SSH.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the SSH service on the device"
        ],
