The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-6405.

**CVE-2017-6405**

*   **Root Cause:** NetBackup relies on hostnames for communication, making it vulnerable to DNS spoofing.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Insecure reliance on hostnames for client/server communication, no proper validation mechanism, which can be bypassed by DNS spoofing.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack by spoofing DNS records, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system and affecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of NetBackup.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack, by manipulating DNS records to redirect NetBackup traffic to a malicious host controlled by an attacker.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to perform DNS spoofing.
