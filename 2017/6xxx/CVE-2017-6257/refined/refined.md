Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-6257:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference in the kernel mode layer handler of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS).
- Potential escalation of privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required (AV:L).
- Low attack complexity (AC:L).
- Low privileges required (PR:L).
- No user interaction needed (UI:N)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs local access to the system, a low privileged user account, and the ability to interact with the affected driver.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects various NVIDIA products including GeForce, NVS, Quadro, Tesla, and GRID series on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.
- The CVSS vector string is: CVSS:3.0/[AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C].
- The vulnerability is present in the kernel mode layer handler of the driver, meaning it is a low-level component of the system and exploitation might lead to significant consequences.
