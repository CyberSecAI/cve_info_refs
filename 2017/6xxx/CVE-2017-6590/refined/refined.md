{
  "cve": "CVE-2017-6590",
  "affected_packages": [
    "gnome-extra/nm-applet",
    "network-manager-applet"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GNOME applet for NetworkManager incorrectly checked permissions when connecting to certain wireless networks, specifically when handling certificate-based authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper permission checks",
      "Lack of restricted mode for the applet",
	  "Applet does not treat its user as a potential attacker"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could bypass security restrictions at the login screen to access local files and potentially execute code with the privileges of the lightdm user. This includes reading, writing, and executing files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the locked computer is required.",
      "The Wi-Fi must be turned on.",
      "A specially crafted access point requiring a certificate for login is needed."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs physical access to a locked computer with Wi-Fi enabled. They must be able to create or control a Wi-Fi access point that uses certificate-based authentication. The attacker does not need to be a privileged user initially."
  },
  "additional_notes": [
	"The vulnerability was triggered when the applet displayed a file picker dialog, allowing the user to browse and open local files.",
    "The issue was found to affect not only the ability to access files, but also the possibility to download and execute malicious binaries.",
	"The vulnerability is triggered when connecting to a cert protected AP. Connecting to open or WPA protected APs gives an insufficient privileges error.",
	"The fix implemented checks permissions before showing the dialog in `src/applet-device-wifi.c`"
  ]
