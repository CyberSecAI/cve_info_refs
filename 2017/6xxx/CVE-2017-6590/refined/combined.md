# GNOME applet for NetworkManager: Arbitrary file read/write — GLSA **201707-09**

A vulnerability has been found in GNOME applet for NetworkManager
allowing local attackers to access the local filesystem.

### Affected packages

| Package | **gnome-extra/nm-applet** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.6-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.6-r1** |

### Background

GNOME applet for NetworkManager is a GTK+ 3 front-end which works under
Xorg environments with a systray.

### Description

Frederic Bardy and Quentin Biguenet discovered that GNOME applet for
NetworkManager incorrectly checked permissions when connecting to certain
wireless networks.

### Impact

A local attacker could bypass security restrictions at the login screen
to access local files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNOME applet for NetworkManager users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-extra/nm-applet-1.4.6-r1"

```

### Bug Description

Hi,

We just found a vulnerability in lightdm who could lead us to read files with lightdm permissions, an also write in some directories.

We were able to download a reverse\_shell payload and execute it in order to gain a reverse shell as lightdm on a remote system.

The exploitation require a physical access to the locked computeur and the Wi-fi must be turned on. A access point who let you use a certificate to log-in is required as well but it's easy to create one.

Then, it's possible to open a nautilus window and browse directories. We also can open some application such as Firefox which is useful to download malicious binaries :-)

See this video for the PoC :

Some info about the Ubuntu version I used on the video above :

$ lsb\_release -rd

Description: Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS

It looks like either the network manager applet or the network manager daemon isn't properly validating the org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.own and org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.system policies before displaying the certificate chooser dialog.

Yes, the only possibility I have to protect my laptop currently is to disable the wifi when I lock my screen :-)

Btw I tested on Ubuntu 14.04 but I was not able to open a nautilus on the lockscreen.

I don't think that the NetworkManager daemon is involved. Or PolicyKit permissions (like org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.own).

The login screen runs nm-applet as lightdm user.

nm-applet doesn't have a concept of running in a restricted mode. That is, it's running as a certain user and it doesn't try to prevent that user from accessing system resources (files) that the user can regularly access.

That is, when it shows the file-picker GUI to allow the user to choose a file, it doesn't try to prevent that user from seeing certain files (yes, it's made worse as the GTK filepicker allows to open the file).

The applet doesn't treat its user as a potential attacker.

How to fix that, is a good question...

Maybe applet could learn a new command line options ("--restricted"), which prevents the user from doing certain things that are considered unsafe.

  - maybe that means to show a less powerful filepicker that cannot open files,

  - maybe it also means to disallow the file-picker to mount filesystems (which makes the

    filepicker pretty useless),

  - in the end it probably means to prevent the user from creating any connection -- only to

    connect to previously configured networks.

Or maybe the login screen should choose to run a different applet instead (or none)...

Ah, I can get to nm-applet if I go back to the greeter to switch users. i.e.

Create a second user called foo

Log in as myself

System Menu -> choose the foo user

Get a greeter

Am I right in thinking that we intended to deny switching networks from nm-applet in lightdm completely?

If I am, then I think the bug is probably that nm-applet is not doing that and is instead asking for creds (i.e. what Marc said in #4). That is - when you click on the network, it should say 'Insufficient privileges' instead of spawning the dialog. It seems to work correctly for me on Zesty, although I don't have one of those certificate networks to check with.

Maybe Quentin or Marc could check on Zesty too and confirm/deny?

More notes:

If I try to connect to an open wifi AP then I get an "Insufficient Privileges" error.

If I try to connect to a WPA protected AP, then I get an "Insufficient Privileges" error.

If I try to connect to a cert. protected AP (BT Wifi X for those in the UK), then I am able to exploit this problem.

Why would things be different for a cert. protected AP? Working this out seems to be a sensible step towards fixing the problem.

It's not really a nm-applet issue.

nm-applet is currently not designed to run in such a restricted mode which would make it safe to expose to unprivileged users.

It's a bug of the login screen to run an application that is not suitable for the security constraints of the login process.

It would be interesting to add a --restricted mode to nm-applet, but I wouldn't call that a bug. It's a missing feature. Until that feature is implemented, it's up to login screen not to use nm-applet.

In reply to comment #11 - this happens on Zesty as well. It is slightly different in that I get a black screen when I try to open file manager, but the I expect those with more determination would be able to work around that.

Re: #14.

NetworkManager does not trust its D-Bus clients and uses PolicyKit to check whether a certain user action is allowed or denied. NetworkManager's D-Bus API exposes these PolicyKit permissions to the client, and they are accessible via libnm (nm\_client\_get\_permission\_result()).

Maybe nm-applet could implement a restricted mode by autodetecting which parts are restricted using PolicyKit permissions. However, it doesn't. If you look at the code, the permission checks there are merely to see whether a certain GUI option should be enabled or not. The intend is to avoid exposing a UI option that is know to fail, not to protect the system from the user.

I think what I said in comment #13 is correct.

Not sure. We can explicitly check the permissions before showing the dialog. See the attached patch.

As noted, most other actions already do this - it's just that \_do\_new\_auto\_connection () decides on its own to create the dialog, even if the user doesn't have the right permissions.

Could someone test and review the patch? Turns out I do have one of those BTWifi-X things near me (whatever they are), so I was able to check that it seems OK for me. I can't cover all usecases though, for example I don't have one of those networks that I can connect to.

at least for me, there is also an "Edit Connections" option, which spawns nm-connection-editor, which has the same problem.

That's because we have a distro patch (just learned that) to hide the

items if the user doesn't have modify.own, modify.system or

modify.hostname.

I'm happy for us to apply this patch as a distro patch too, if that's

preferred and Thomas doesn't want it upstream.

I think the patch is the right approach (maybe it's not yet perfect, but goes the right direction).

I think we definitely want such patches upstream.

I talked now with dcbw, he confirmed and applet is supposed to be suitable for a login-screen. If it isn't, it's a bug. (I was wrong there!!, sorry).

The lightdm user should not be able to access any useful certificate files from the system. Thus, choosing a certification from file seems to be only useful, if the user could mount an USB stick -- which the lightdm user shouldn't be able to do.

So, the non-logged-in user can realistically only create non-enterprise connections, which doesn't seem too useful either.

So, creating/modifying \*any\* connection from the loginscreen shouldn't be possible from the login-screen (and prevented by having no MODIFY\_SYSTEM|MODIFY\_OWN permissions).

Ergo: the user shall only be able to connect to existing connections that are already provisioned previously.

I think there is a additional issue, that if the connection has secrets that are agent-owned, NM will present a password-popup to the user (good). But then, the ligthdm user must not put those secrets into the keyring, otherwise, the next time a malicious user could see those previously entered passwords.

Either applet must not try to cache such passwords, or the keyring must not be accessible for the lightdm user.

I've freed the connection before return to avoid the mem leak

mentioned by Laney, but there looks to be more stuff could be leaked

(i.e. s\_con, s\_wifi, s\_wsec, s\_8021x).

No I don't think so, those are all passed to nm\_connection\_add\_setting()

which causes the connection to take ownership of them.

Just tested on Xenial - the free is causing nm-applet to crash with an invalid pointer message.

Spoke to Aron who is going to upload a different version for testing.

Tested the new version, it works. I now get the insufficient privileges error when trying to connect to a cert. authenticated network.

Aron is going to rework the patch with a free in. This should be ready soon and we can upload the fix later on today.

Looks like you used spaces instead of tabs for the g\_clear\_object()

line, but otherwise I think this is okay (can hopefully be fixed when

uploading) - Marc, is the patch alone enough for you to go on or do you

want debdiffs?

Nice find. There is another lock screen bypass that still exists if you hold right click option down before the screensaver activates. I don't believe that has even been fully and properly patched and has existed for years. And now the accessibility features seem like ripe targets for further review too. Makes you wonder just how many other local bypass issues still exist (or have been planted by espionage agencies).

| [Description](#c0)  Roger Nordqvist    2002-08-07 04:23:59 UTC  ``` Ive now done a couple of installations of KDE3 with Perl 5.8.0 installed and  found the following problems and solutions:   First thing Im running into is when installing the SGMLSpm package. It fails  telling me it can create some directories. Ive tracked the problem down to the  make file in /usr/portage/dev-perl/SGMLSpm/files   If I open it i vim I can see it has a hard directory reference to 5.6.1 ... I  change this and do another emerge kde and everything goes ok.   The installation will fail again when installing the XML perl module telling me  about a access violation. I have to comment out the Sandbox in make.globals to  get around this.   Then another emerge kde and then the last packages get installed.   Hope this can help someone.   /Roger ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Seemant Kulleen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-08-07 15:32:09 UTC  ``` Roger, yes this helps a lot. Thanks :) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Cummings (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-08-07 15:54:15 UTC  ``` Roger,       There is already a bug report and a masked fix for SGMLSpm. The sandbox issue you describe sounds like one that was corrected with last night's commit of the new perl-modules.eclass file.        ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Roger Nordqvist    2002-08-07 16:08:37 UTC  ``` Great that it is being sorted out ...  The perl modules in general is needed some atension in general I think to get  em to work with Perl 5.8.0. One thing I saw today is that SSLeay is depricated  and get the user into trouble when trying to emerge webmin with Perl 5.8.0.  /Roger  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Michael Cummings (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-08-09 06:26:52 UTC  ``` Roger,       Will take a look around on the deprication (though if the perl folks have  depricated, that's way out of my pervue ;) ). I'm seeing a lot of apps that use  perl (not as a depend, but literally as a use) that are having trouble with  perl 5.8. I just want you to know that I am looking into it, but I cannot  guarantee a fix for you this weekend. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Roger Nordqvist    2002-08-09 08:45:16 UTC  ``` No hurry ... I know ya do what ya can ;-)  Im just glad to be of assistans to help ya find the creeps =)  /Roger ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Michael Cummings (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-08-14 13:24:08 UTC  ``` Roger,       Since I last looked at this bug, I have done a lot of work with the perl  5.8 install (the most recent version of which is tucked away nicely at home).  If you would like, I can get you a copy of it. The problem you mentioned with  things like SSLeay is actually do to a change in the default flags that perl  sends to gcc at compile time for modules/apps - it no longer sends the -DPERL5  flag. My more recent ebuilds manually correct that in the finished perl  install. I will say that as a test I went through some of the kde-base pieces  today on my perl 5.8 box and had no problems emerging them. Let me know if  there is anything else I can do,  Mike   ps. sgmlspm was fixed, then b0rked again, have an -r3 in the works that  corrects it. There is no configuration stage for that module, so most of it has  to be done the hardway - sed ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Michael Cummings (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-31 06:50:15 UTC  ``` Roger,     two months since any activity. ``` |  |
