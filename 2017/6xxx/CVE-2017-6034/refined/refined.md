Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-6034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Modicon Modbus protocol transmits sensitive information in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass by Capture-Replay (CWE-294):** Due to the lack of encryption, an attacker can capture network traffic containing Modbus commands (like run, stop, upload, and download) and replay them later to manipulate the PLC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthorized remote attacker can capture and replay sensitive commands to PLCs. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized control of the PLC.
    - Starting or stopping PLC processes.
    - Uploading or downloading modified configurations or code to the PLC.
    - Potential disruption of industrial processes controlled by the PLC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment or have network access to the PLC using the Modbus protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Modicon PLC.
- **Traffic Capture:** The attacker needs to be able to capture the Modbus network traffic to obtain the commands.
- **Replay Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to replay the captured commands to the PLC.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable and requires low skill level to exploit.
- The specific affected products are all versions of the Modicon Modbus protocol, implying wide applicability across Modicon PLCs.
- The advisory suggests mitigation methods, including:
    - Firewalling access to port 502.
    - Using authentication.
    - Employing access control lists.
    - Using VPNs (with recognition of their own potential vulnerabilities).
