Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the plaintext storage of passwords in a file accessible without authentication on the Detcon SiteWatch Gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of a Password (CWE-256):**  Passwords are stored in plaintext, making them easily accessible if an attacker gains access to the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain user passwords, which could lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Gaining access to user credentials allows the attacker to potentially change settings, impacting the system's intended functionality, although this is not the direct result of this specific vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The plaintext password file is accessible without needing to authenticate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the device.
- **Low Skill Level:** The advisory notes it is "low skill level to exploit."
- **No Prior Authentication:**  The attacker does not need to authenticate to access the password file.
