  "CVE-2017-6594": {
    "description": "The transit path validation code in Heimdal before 7.3 might allow attackers to bypass the capath policy protection mechanism by leveraging failure to add the previous hop realm to the transit path of issued tickets.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A commit in 2010 inadvertently caused the previous hop realm to not be added to the transit path of issued tickets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of the transit path in Kerberos tickets",
        "Failure to include the previous hop realm in the transit path"
      ],
      "impact": "Bypass of capath policy, potentially allowing unauthorized access across realms.",
      "attack_vectors": "Exploitation occurs during cross-realm authentication. An attacker would likely need to be in a position to influence or observe the ticket issuing process.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have some control or visibility of the ticket path creation in order to exploit this issue. It could be a compromised client, server, or a machine in the network path."
