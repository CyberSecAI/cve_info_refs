```
- Root cause of vulnerability: OS command injection vulnerability in the nslookup function of the diagnostic tools.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary OS commands via the ping_ip parameter.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This includes actions such as establishing a reverse shell or dumping sensitive files like the password file.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface, specifically the nslookup functionality in the diagnostic tools.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to access the web interface of the router, which is typically done from a device on the same network.
