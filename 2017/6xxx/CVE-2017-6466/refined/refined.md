The provided content is related to CVE-2017-6466.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The F-Secure Software Updater downloads installation packages over HTTP without proper verification. These packages are then executed under the SYSTEM account.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure download of packages over HTTP.
- Lack of proper verification of downloaded packages.
- Execution of downloaded packages under SYSTEM account.
- Insufficient verification of signatures allowing for the replacement of legitimate signed software with malicious signed software.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker, through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, can modify the downloaded packages and gain complete control of the target system by executing arbitrary code under the SYSTEM account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the HTTP connection used by F-Secure Software Updater to download packages.
- Replacement of legitimate software packages with malicious ones.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform a MITM attack on the network communication between the F-Secure Software Updater and its update servers.
- Ability to intercept and modify HTTP traffic.
- Possibility to provide a signed malicious package, if the signature check is enabled. This can be done by using an already signed binary of another software.
