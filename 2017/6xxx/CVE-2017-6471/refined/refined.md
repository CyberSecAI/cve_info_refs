Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-6471:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the WSP (Wireless Session Protocol) dissector in Wireshark. A malformed packet, specifically crafted, triggers an infinite loop within the `dissect_wsp` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The primary weakness is the ability to cause an infinite loop in the WSP dissector when processing specially crafted packets. This loop continues indefinitely, consuming system resources.
- **Memory Consumption:** As the loop continues, it consumes excessive amounts of memory, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a denial of service. Wireshark can become unresponsive and crash due to excessive memory consumption.
- **Potential Crash:** The excessive resource consumption can lead to Wireshark crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Network Traffic:** An attacker can inject a malformed WSP packet onto the network. If a user is running Wireshark and capturing this traffic, it will trigger the vulnerability.
- **Malicious PCAP File:** An attacker could create a malicious PCAP (packet capture) file containing the specific malformed WSP packet. If a user opens this PCAP file with Wireshark, the vulnerability will be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access/Injection:** An attacker needs the ability to inject packets onto the network that is being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Social Engineering:** Alternatively, the attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious PCAP file containing the crafted WSP packet.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Antti Levom√§ki and Christian Jalio of Forcepoint.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.4 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.10.
- It was fixed in Wireshark versions 2.2.5 and 2.0.11.
