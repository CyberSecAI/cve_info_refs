| **Affects** | All versions of `ntpq`, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p10, and ntp-4.3.0 up to, but not including ntp-4.3.94. | Resolved in 4.2.8p10. |

---

#### Description

A stack buffer overflow in `ntpq` can be triggered by a malicious `ntpd` server when `ntpq` requests the restriction list from the server. This is due to a missing length check in the `reslist()` function. It occurs whenever the function parses the serverâs response and encounters a `flagstr` variable of an excessive length. The string will be copied into a fixed-size buffer, leading to an overflow on the functionâs stack-frame.

> Note well that this problem requires a malicious server, and affects `ntpq`, not `ntpd`.

---

#### Mitigation

* Upgrade to [4.2.8p10 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)
* If you can’t upgrade your version of `ntpq` then if you want to know the `reslist` of an instance of `ntpd` that you do not control, know that if the target `ntpd` is malicious that it can send back a response that intends to crash your `ntpq` process.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

### Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) library has been found to contain a vulnerability CVE-2017-6460. Palo Alto Networks software makes use of the vulnerable library and may be affected. This issue only affects the management plane of the firewall. (Ref # PAN-76130 / CVE-2017-6460)

Successful exploitation of this issue requires an attacker to be on the management interface.

This issue affects PAN-OS 6.1, PAN-OS 7.0.17 and earlier, PAN-OS 7.1.11 and earlier, PAN-OS 8.0.3 and earlier

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | <= 8.0.3 | >= 8.0.4 |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | <= 7.1.11 | >= 7.1.12 |
| PAN-OS 7.0 | <= 7.0.17 | >= 7.0.18 |
| PAN-OS 6.1 | 6.1.\* | None |

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
8.8 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119")

### Solution

PAN-OS 7.0.18 or later, PAN-OS 7.1.12 or later, PAN-OS 8.0.4 or later

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Palo Alto Networks recommends to implement best practice by allowing web interface access only to a dedicated management network. Additionally, restrict the set of IP addresses to a subset of authorized sources that you allow to interact with the management network.

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3377#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2017-02-11 04:16:08 UTC   [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3377#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2017-02-11 04:22:41 UTC  ``` A stack buffer overflow can be triggered by a malicious server when a client (using ntpq) requests the restriction list from the server. This is due to a missing length check in the reslist() function. It occurs whenever the function parses the server’s response and encounters a flagstr variable of an extensive length. The string will be copied into a fixed-size buffer, leading to an overflow on the function’s stack-frame.  Although this issue is mitigated by having the ntpq compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE, the default compilation flags do not include this option (see [bug 3376](show_bug.cgi?id=3376 "RESOLVED FIXED")), thus leaving a considerable percentage of clients vulnerable. Additionally, stack canaries do not entirely prevent this issue since the overflow allows to overwrite pointers which are used for reading and writing from and to memory before the stack canary is reached. Having control over these pointers makes it possible for an attacker to bypass the stack canary protection. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3377#c2)  Juergen Perlinger    2017-02-11 18:33:20 UTC  ``` The repo is in   psp.ntp.org:~perlinger/ntp-stable-3377 ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3377#c3)  Harlan Stenn    2017-03-01 06:23:29 UTC  ``` STAGED for 4.2.8p10 ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3377#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2017-03-22 00:08:22 UTC  ``` Pearly,  Thanks for your work on this. ``` |  |
