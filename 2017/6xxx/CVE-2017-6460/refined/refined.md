{
  "CVE-2017-6460": {
    "Description": "A stack buffer overflow in `ntpq` can be triggered by a malicious `ntpd` server when `ntpq` requests the restriction list from the server. This is due to a missing length check in the `reslist()` function. It occurs whenever the function parses the server’s response and encounters a `flagstr` variable of an excessive length. The string will be copied into a fixed-size buffer, leading to an overflow on the function’s stack-frame.",
    "Root cause": "Missing length check in the `reslist()` function when parsing the server's response, specifically the `flagstr` variable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious `ntpd` server can cause a stack buffer overflow in the `ntpq` client, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution on the client machine.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious `ntpd` server sends an overly long `flagstr` in response to an `ntpq` request for the restriction list."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control an `ntpd` server and be able to have a vulnerable `ntpq` client connect to it."
