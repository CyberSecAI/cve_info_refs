  "response": {
    "match": true,
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the `fanout_add()` function of the Linux kernel's raw packet (af_packet) fanout feature. Multiple threads can call `fanout_add()` concurrently.",

      "Race condition: Multiple threads can call `fanout_add()` simultaneously, leading to a race condition.",

      "Local exploitation: Attacker must have local access to the system.",
      "CAP_NET_RAW capability: The attacker must possess the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability."
