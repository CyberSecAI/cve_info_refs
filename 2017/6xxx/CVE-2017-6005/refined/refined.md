- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "WavesSysSvc" service, installed by Waves MaxxAudit, has an unquoted service path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted service path vulnerability. This occurs when the path to the executable of a Windows service is not enclosed in quotation marks and contains spaces.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authorized, non-privileged local user can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious executable in a directory within the service path. When the service starts, it could execute the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local, non-privileged user with the ability to write files to the system.
