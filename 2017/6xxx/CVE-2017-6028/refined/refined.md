Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of insufficient protection for credentials. Specifically, login credentials for the web application are transmitted over the network using Base64 encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure transmission of credentials using Base64 encoding, which is easily reversible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to sniff (capture) login credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the web application.
* **Unauthorized Access:** With captured credentials, an attacker can log in and potentially compromise the application's functionality and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network Sniffing:** Attackers can passively capture network traffic and extract the Base64 encoded credentials.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers could potentially intercept communications and extract the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to be able to capture network traffic containing the login credentials. This can be achieved through local network access or by compromising a system on the same network.
* **Basic Decoding Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to decode the Base64 encoded credentials.
