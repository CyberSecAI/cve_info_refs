The provided content relates to CVE-2017-6511.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtering of user-supplied data in the "action" HTTP parameter. The value of the `$_GET['action']` parameter is directly used in the code without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "action" parameter, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
*   Session hijacking
*   Redirecting the user to malicious sites
*   Defacing the website
*   Stealing user credentials or sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL. The attacker must convince the victim to click on the malicious link. This can be done by sending the link through email, social media, or any other communication medium.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs to be able to construct a malicious URL and then deliver it to the victim. No special privileges on the server or web application are required.
