Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-6253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver, specifically within the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. The root cause is that the size of an input buffer is not validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input buffer size validation in the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler. This allows for the possibility of providing an improperly sized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
- It can also potentially lead to an escalation of privileges, allowing an attacker to gain higher-level access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited locally.
- The attack requires a local user to interact with the vulnerable driver component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the NVIDIA GPU display driver through the `DxgkDdiEscape` interface.
- The attacker doesn't require elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `nvlddmkm.sys` file is explicitly mentioned as the vulnerable component.
- The CVSS base score is 8.8, indicating a high severity.
- A fix for this vulnerability is included in driver versions 384.94 (GeForce), 385.08 (Quadro, NVS, Tesla) and 377.55 (Quadro, NVS, Tesla for branch R375)
