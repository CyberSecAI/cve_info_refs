## Description

[![@burghardt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1455217?u=dbf813ebd232a04a50e4ccb261ba8a41f9f95e66&v=4&size=48)](/burghardt)[burghardt](https://github.com/burghardt)opened [on Nov 8, 2018](https://github.com/avahi/avahi/issues/203#issue-378803549)

I tried with Scapy to do a reflection with amplification on mDNS service running Avahi (git master branch and version 0.7) with a good result. This is very similar to issue [CloudFlare observed with SSDP](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ssdp-100gbps/): lack of link-local checks when processing queries.

I sent spoofed datagram to mDNS with:

```
send(IP(src="1.1.1.1")/UDP(sport=53, dport=5353)/DNS(rd=1,qd=DNSQR(qtype="PTR", qname="_ssh._tcp.local.")))

```

This was responded by Avahi with amplification from 75 to 176 bytes and sent to spoofed IP.

```
15:41:47.604623 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1, offset 0, flags [none], proto UDP (17), length 61)
    1.1.1.1.53 > 192.168.1.195.5353: [udp sum ok] 0+ PTR? _ssh._tcp.local. (33)
15:41:47.604809 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 255, id 63310, offset 0, flags [DF], proto UDP (17), length 162)
    192.168.1.195.5353 > 1.1.1.1.53: [bad udp cksum 0xc50c -> 0xed6c!] 0*- q: PTR? _ssh._tcp.local. 5/0/0 _ssh._tcp.local. [10s] PTR kali._ssh._tcp.local., kali._ssh._tcp.local. [10s] TXT "", kali._ssh._tcp.local. [10s] SRV kali.local.:22 0 0, kali.local. [10s] AAAA fe80::aee2:d3ff:fe38:d359, kali.local. [10s] A 192.168.1.195 (134)

```

Attaching PCAP file with query and response. Query was sent from same subnet.

[avahi-traffic-reflection.pcap.gz](https://github.com/lathiat/avahi/files/2562479/avahi-traffic-reflection.pcap.gz)

As you see Avahi replied to multicast query and sent reply to Cloudflare's DNS server on 53 port. TTL was 255. My router decremented that to 254 and forwarded packet to WAN, Unicast queries seems to be handled in a similar way.

I tested some more devices not running Avahi to have better understanding of the issue. My very old AVR (vulnerable to mDNS reflection on various ports, seems to have no link-local checks). Avahi-daemon (0.6.32 also vulnerable, didn't fallback to multicast, nor ignore non link-local queries, moreover it responds with unicast to src/dst port 5353 which seems to violate RFS and cause even more reflections possible).

On the other hand Google Chromecast seems to do very strict link-local checks and answers mostly with multicast replies. What is very interesting, as it ignores any non link-local queries. I was unable to do any reflection with Chromecast. I played also a bit with AppleTV's mDNS implementation and it seems to ignore all my attempts just as Chromecast do.

In my opinion section 11 of mDNS RFC 6762 still applies to Legacy Unicast Responses. Link-local checks should be done, and non link-local queries discarded. Google Chromecast seems to ignore requirements of s ection 6.7 (Legacy Unicast Responses) and sends response to 5353 port with multicast reply.

Could this be fixed just by a strict verification of source address belongs to link-local network to make sure remote, rouge queries are ignored? The second part of improvement would be removal of legacy support and force of fallback to multicast to ensure answers are link-local too. This however might break backward compatibility as I understand.

## Binary packages built by this source

[avahi-autoipd](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/avahi-autoipd):
Avahi IPv4LL network address configuration daemon

Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.

 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts

 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For

 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to

 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.

 .

 This tool implements IPv4LL, "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local

 Addresses" (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address

 configuration from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the

 need for a central server. It is primarily intended to be used in

 ad-hoc networks which lack a DHCP server.

## Description

[![@burghardt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1455217?u=dbf813ebd232a04a50e4ccb261ba8a41f9f95e66&v=4&size=48)](/burghardt)[burghardt](https://github.com/burghardt)opened [on Nov 8, 2018](https://github.com/avahi/avahi/issues/203#issue-378803549)

I tried with Scapy to do a reflection with amplification on mDNS service running Avahi (git master branch and version 0.7) with a good result. This is very similar to issue [CloudFlare observed with SSDP](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ssdp-100gbps/): lack of link-local checks when processing queries.

I sent spoofed datagram to mDNS with:

```
send(IP(src="1.1.1.1")/UDP(sport=53, dport=5353)/DNS(rd=1,qd=DNSQR(qtype="PTR", qname="_ssh._tcp.local.")))

```

This was responded by Avahi with amplification from 75 to 176 bytes and sent to spoofed IP.

```
15:41:47.604623 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 1, offset 0, flags [none], proto UDP (17), length 61)
    1.1.1.1.53 > 192.168.1.195.5353: [udp sum ok] 0+ PTR? _ssh._tcp.local. (33)
15:41:47.604809 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 255, id 63310, offset 0, flags [DF], proto UDP (17), length 162)
    192.168.1.195.5353 > 1.1.1.1.53: [bad udp cksum 0xc50c -> 0xed6c!] 0*- q: PTR? _ssh._tcp.local. 5/0/0 _ssh._tcp.local. [10s] PTR kali._ssh._tcp.local., kali._ssh._tcp.local. [10s] TXT "", kali._ssh._tcp.local. [10s] SRV kali.local.:22 0 0, kali.local. [10s] AAAA fe80::aee2:d3ff:fe38:d359, kali.local. [10s] A 192.168.1.195 (134)

```

Attaching PCAP file with query and response. Query was sent from same subnet.

[avahi-traffic-reflection.pcap.gz](https://github.com/lathiat/avahi/files/2562479/avahi-traffic-reflection.pcap.gz)

As you see Avahi replied to multicast query and sent reply to Cloudflare's DNS server on 53 port. TTL was 255. My router decremented that to 254 and forwarded packet to WAN, Unicast queries seems to be handled in a similar way.

I tested some more devices not running Avahi to have better understanding of the issue. My very old AVR (vulnerable to mDNS reflection on various ports, seems to have no link-local checks). Avahi-daemon (0.6.32 also vulnerable, didn't fallback to multicast, nor ignore non link-local queries, moreover it responds with unicast to src/dst port 5353 which seems to violate RFS and cause even more reflections possible).

On the other hand Google Chromecast seems to do very strict link-local checks and answers mostly with multicast replies. What is very interesting, as it ignores any non link-local queries. I was unable to do any reflection with Chromecast. I played also a bit with AppleTV's mDNS implementation and it seems to ignore all my attempts just as Chromecast do.

In my opinion section 11 of mDNS RFC 6762 still applies to Legacy Unicast Responses. Link-local checks should be done, and non link-local queries discarded. Google Chromecast seems to ignore requirements of s ection 6.7 (Legacy Unicast Responses) and sends response to 5353 port with multicast reply.

Could this be fixed just by a strict verification of source address belongs to link-local network to make sure remote, rouge queries are ignored? The second part of improvement would be removal of legacy support and force of fallback to multicast to ensure answers are link-local too. This however might break backward compatibility as I understand.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-24 16:22:55 UTC  ``` It was found that avahi responds to unicast queries coming from outside of local network which may cause an information leak, such as disclosing the device type/model that responds to the request or the operating system. The mDNS response may also be used to amplify denial of service attacks against other networks as the response size is greater than the size of request.  External References:  <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/550620>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-24 16:29:51 UTC  ``` Created avahi tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1426717](show_bug.cgi?id=1426717 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-6519 avahi: Multicast DNS responds to unicast queries outside of local network [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c3)  Doran Moppert    2017-04-06 02:40:43 UTC  ``` While all versions of avahi seem to be affected, for reasons discussed at the CERT link above this is not strictly a security bug.  > While this technically follows established RFCs and is not a vulnerability in the normal sense, for reasons outlined above this may be unwanted behavior.  avahi could be enhanced with a configuration option controlling this behaviour, but blocking inter-segment mDNS traffic is, in general, a task better performed at the firewall.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c4)  Antonios Atlasis    2017-04-14 19:48:00 UTC  ``` Hi  First, if it is not a bug, why this was fixed for IPv4? Avahi used to be affected over IPv4 (as the above link staes) but this is not the case any more (I have tested personally).   Secondly, as RFC 6762 Section 5.5 states:  "Since it is possible for a unicast query to be received from a machine outside the local link, responders SHOULD check that the source address in the query packet matches the local subnet for that link (or, in the case of IPv6, the source address has an on-link prefix) and silently ignore the packet if not."  Be aware though that the word SHOULD above is not the English word 'should', but as stated in RFC 2119 "This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course".  Moreover, the statement on the aforementioned link does not say that this is not a security issue, but this is not a vulnerability in the normal sense, depending on the RFC interpretation, of course (I tried to clarify it above). As an example, Type 0 Routing header was defined in RFC 2460 (and hence, its support should not be a vulnerability in the normal sense), but it was deprecated with RFC 5095 when it was found out that it can be used for DoS amplification attacks.   Finally, major vendors like Apple, Google, Cisco, Microsoft, etc. do not allow remote unicast interaction, neither over IPv4, nor over IPv6 (I have tested the first two, this is stated for the last two in the aforementioned link).    Kind regards  Antonios   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-02 14:49:39 UTC  ``` Even though you can set a firewall to prevent external actors from exploiting this flaw, I believe this can still be considered a security issue/flaw, because it allows an attacker on the intranet to DDoS external entities. Yes, you could set the firewall explicitly to filter out requests originating from port 5353 and with dst port 53, but I believe this is not a so common thing to do (you do not usually filter dst port 53 because of DNS, so everybody who has Avahi on at least one of his devices should configure the firewall)  Thus I think it would be better to just fix the flaw at the avahi-daemon level.  [CVE-2018-1000845](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1000845) seems to be a duplicate of this flaw. I'd like to request duplicate-rejection to MITRE for [CVE-2018-1000845](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1000845) and reopen this bug. Thoughts?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c6)  Doran Moppert    2019-01-03 00:22:51 UTC  ``` > I believe this can still be considered a security issue/flaw, because it allows an attacker on the intranet to [D]DoS external entities.  Fair enough, I agree this is a legitimate concern though the impact remains low given firewall mitigations and the rate-limiting you pointed out in [bug 1661252](show_bug.cgi?id=1661252 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2018-1000845 avahi: DNS amplification and reflection to spoofed addresses").  > [CVE-2018-1000845](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1000845) seems to be a duplicate of this flaw. I'd like to request duplicate-rejection to MITRE for [CVE-2018-1000845](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1000845) and reopen this bug. Thoughts?  Agreed, it looks like a duplicate.  There seems to be some confusion about IPv4 vs IPv6, but the upstream discussion indicates a common root cause & patch.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-04 08:31:01 UTC  ``` Setting Availability in CVSSv3 to Low because of the rate-limiting feature enabled by default in Avahi, that allows to generate a maximum of 1000 packets per second (which can be configured with the ratelimit-interval-usec and ratelimit-burst options in /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-04 08:31:07 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Ensure UDP port 5353 is blocked in the firewall. Moreover, configure correctly the rate limiting options based on your needs (see ratelimit-interval-usec and ratelimit-burst options in /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c9)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-04 08:36:37 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/lathiat/avahi/commit/e111def44a7df4624a4aa3f85fe98054bffb6b4f>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-04 08:38:35 UTC  ``` Re-opening bug for reasons explained in [comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c5).   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c15)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-31 08:18:03 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1661252](show_bug.cgi?id=1661252 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2018-1000845 avahi: DNS amplification and reflection to spoofed addresses") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-03-31 19:31:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2020:1176 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1176](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1176)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1426712#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-03-31 22:31:54 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
