Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-6550:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities within the Kinsey Infor/Lawson (formerly ESBUS) application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in at least two parameters:
  1. The `TABLE` parameter in the `/esbus/servlet/GetSQLData` endpoint.
  2. The `QUERY` POST parameter in the `/KK_LS9ReportingPortal/GetData` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database.
- This can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- The vulnerability could allow for the writing of a JSP webshell into the `/esbus/` directory, potentially leading to further compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vectors are through HTTP GET and POST requests.
   1.  A crafted GET request with a manipulated `TABLE` parameter.
   2.  A crafted POST request with a manipulated `QUERY` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, indicating they need network access to the application.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned for exploitation beyond network access to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**
- **TABLE Parameter SQLi:**
  - Vulnerable URL: `/esbus/servlet/GetSQLData`
  - Vulnerable Parameter: `TABLE`
  - Example Payload: `TABLE=SCHEDULEDTASKS UNION ALL SELECT <<ATTACKER INPUT>>`

- **QUERY POST Parameter SQLi:**
  - Vulnerable URL: `/KK_LS9ReportingPortal/GetData`
  - Vulnerable Parameter: `QUERY` (POST parameter)
  - Example Payload: `QUERY=1 AND SLEEP(5) AND ('foo'='foo')`

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was tested on a Windows Server 2008 R2 system running MySQL version 5.5.
- The vendor was contacted in December 2016 and was notified of intent to disclose on 2/27/2017, but didn't reply.
