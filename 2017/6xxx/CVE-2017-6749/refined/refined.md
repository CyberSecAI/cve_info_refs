Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the web-based management interface of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts provided by an attacker are stored on the server and then executed when a user interacts with the affected part of the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session when they access the vulnerable web interface.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Stealing of sensitive information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Further attacks against other systems

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely.
- Web-based Management Interface: The attack is launched through the WSA's web-based management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface. This means a user with low privileges can still exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both virtual and hardware versions of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).
- Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) are not affected by this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 6.4, indicating a medium severity.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Daniel Jensen of Security-Assessment.com.
