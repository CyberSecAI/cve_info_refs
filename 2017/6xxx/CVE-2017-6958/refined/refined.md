Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6958

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Source Integration plugin's search results page. Specifically, the search term is not properly encoded, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw, where malicious code can be injected into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary HTML/JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or javascript code within the context of the vulnerable web page. If MantisBT's default Content Security Policy (CSP) is disabled, JavaScript code can be injected and executed, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking (stealing user cookies)
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Other malicious actions through JavaScript execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious search term: An attacker can craft a malicious search term containing HTML or JavaScript code.
- Search Results Page: The vulnerable search results page displays the unsanitized search term, allowing the injection to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges required. Any user with access to the search functionality can potentially exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to input the malicious code through the search box to trigger the XSS.
