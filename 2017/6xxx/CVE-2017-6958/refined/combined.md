## Description

[![@dregad](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/449891?v=4&size=48)](/dregad)[dregad](https://github.com/dregad)opened [on Mar 16, 2017](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/source-integration/issues/205#issue-214763066)

Dmitry Ivanov [d1m0ck](https://twitter.com/d1m0ck) reported[\*1](http://openbugbounty.org/incidents/218993/) a security vulnerability in the Source Integration plugin's search results page, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript code (the latter, only if MantisBT's default CSP are disabled).
