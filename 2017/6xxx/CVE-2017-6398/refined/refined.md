Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a command injection flaw in the `saveCert.imss` endpoint of Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security (IMSVA). The application uses user-provided inputs as arguments for operating system commands without proper sanitization.  Although there is a blacklist implemented, it is insufficient.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system via unsanitized user input.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing malicious code to be included in command arguments.
    *   **Improper Blacklisting:** The blacklist used to prevent malicious input is inadequate and can be bypassed.
    *   **Default Credentials:** The description mentions that default installations of IMSVA come with default administrator credentials, which can be used to authenticate and exploit this vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
    *   **Root Privileges:** The commands are executed with the privileges of the web server user, which is root in this case. This allows for complete system control.
    *   **Data Breach/System Compromise:** An attacker can gain full control of the affected system, which can result in data breaches, malware deployment, or further attacks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the IMSVA product, specifically the `saveCert.imss` endpoint.
    *   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. However, default credentials are provided by the installation.
    
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the IMSVA web interface.
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate to the IMSVA system. It should be noted that default administrator credentials are present in default installations.

The content provides more details than a typical CVE description, including specifics about the vulnerable endpoint (`saveCert.imss`), the nature of the command injection, and the context of execution (root). It also mentions the availability of a Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability.
