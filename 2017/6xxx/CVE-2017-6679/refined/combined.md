This vulnerability is due to an undocumented support mechanism that is present on the product. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining privileges sufficient to access the remote support tunnel. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the appliance remotely and obtain full control without explicit customer approval.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Cisco Umbrella originally published this advisory in 2017 on a different site that has since been archived.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-umbrella-tunnel-gJw5thgE>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliances.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance releases 2.0.3 and earlier contained an undocumented encrypted remote support tunnel (SSH) which auto initiated from customer appliances to Cisco SSH Hubs in the Umbrella data centers. These tunnels were primarily leveraged for remote support and allowed for authorized and authenticated personnel from the Cisco Umbrella team to access the appliance remotely and obtain full control without explicit customer approval. To address this vulnerability, Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance Release 2.1.0 now requires explicit customer approval before an SSH tunnel from the virtual appliance to the Cisco terminating server can be established.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following table(s) was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

# Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance - Undocumented Support Tunnel (CVE-2017-6679)

## Overview

"As the industryâ€™s first Secure Internet Gateway in the cloud, Cisco Umbrella provides the first line of defense against threats on the internet. Because Umbrella
is delivered from the cloud, it is the easiest way to protect all of your users in minutes."

(https://umbrella.cisco.com/)
## Issue

The Cisco Umbrella virtual appliance (version 2.0.3 and below) contains an undocumented, auto-initiated reverse SSH tunnel which allows the Cisco Umbrella support
team to have persistent and unrestricted access to the virtual appliance.
## Impact

The reverse SSH tunnel allows the Cisco Umbrella support team to have a persistent node on the network the virtual appliance is deployed on. A rogue employee or
attacker able to compromise the Cisco Umbrella infrastructure could have access to all virtual appliances across the Cisco Umbrella customer base and
perform a wide range of attacks.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator: Â  Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent AV:Â Network AV:Â Physical  Attack Complexity AC:Â Low AC:Â High  Privileges Required PR:Â None PR:Â Low PR:Â High  User Interaction UI:Â Required UI:Â None  Scope S:Â Unchanged S:Â Changed  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Low C:Â High  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Low I:Â High  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Low A:Â High     Base Score: 6.4 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:Â Unknown  RC:Â Reasonable  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â High   Integrity Requirement IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â High   Availability Requirement AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â High   Modified Attack Vector MAV:Â Local  MAV:Â Adjacent  MAV:Â Network  MAV:Â Physical  MAV:Â Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC:Â Low  MAC:Â High  MAC:Â Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR:Â None  MPR:Â Low  MPR:Â High  MPR:Â Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI:Â Required  MUI:Â None  MUI:Â Not Defined   Modified Scope MS:Â Unchanged  MS:Â Changed  MS:Â Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC:Â None  MC:Â Low  MC:Â High  MC:Â Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI:Â None  MI:Â Low  MI:Â High  MI:Â Not Defined   Modified Availability MA:Â None  MA:Â Low  MA:Â High  MA:Â Not Defined      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
