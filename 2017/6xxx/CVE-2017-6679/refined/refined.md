Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **undocumented remote support mechanism** present in Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance versions 2.0.3 and earlier. This mechanism involved an **auto-initiated, encrypted SSH tunnel** from the customer's appliance to Cisco's SSH hubs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Undocumented Feature:** The presence of the remote support tunnel was not documented, and the customer was not explicitly notified or required to give approval.
*   **Persistent Access:** The SSH tunnel created a persistent connection, providing ongoing access to the appliance.
*   **Privileged Access:** The tunnel provided Cisco support personnel with full control over the appliance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Control:** An attacker who gains access to the support tunnel can achieve full control over the affected Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance.
*   **Remote Access:** This access is remote, enabling attackers to control the appliance without being on the local network.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Exploitation could allow for access without explicit customer authorization.
*   **Compromise of Customer Network:** A compromised Cisco infrastructure could allow an attacker to have access to the virtual appliances of all Cisco Umbrella customers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers would need to gain access to the remote support tunnel, which was originally intended for Cisco personnel.
*   **Compromise of Cisco Infrastructure:**  A rogue employee or an attacker compromising the Cisco Umbrella infrastructure could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker would need to obtain privileges sufficient to access the remote support tunnel. This might involve compromising the Cisco support infrastructure or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** While the initial access is remote through the tunnel, the attacker effectively gains access to the appliance's network once the connection is established.

**Additional Information:**

*   Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance Release 2.1.0 addresses the vulnerability by requiring explicit customer approval before an SSH tunnel can be established.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported to OpenDNS in 2015 before Cisco acquired them.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The provided CVSS v3 score is 6.4 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates a local attack vector with high attack complexity, high privileges required, no user interaction, and impacts to confidentiality, integrity and availability being high.

The extracted information provides greater detail than the basic CVE description, particularly around the nature of the undocumented support tunnel, the timeline of reporting and fixing the issue, and the potential for widespread impact.
