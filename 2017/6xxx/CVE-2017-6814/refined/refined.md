Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-6814:

**Verification:**
The content directly mentions CVE-2017-6814 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in WordPress version 4.7.3. The description of the vulnerability aligns with the details found in the provided resources, confirming the content's relevance.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper sanitization of meta information (ID3 tags) in audio files, specifically MP3 files, uploaded to WordPress. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code within the metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Two XSS vulnerabilities exist:
    1.  One in the `wp_playlist_shortcode()` function where meta information from audio files used in link text isn't encoded.
    2.  Another DOM-based XSS issue in `/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-playlist.js` where `renderTracks()` uses meta information without output encoding via jQuery's `append()` method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code via the ID3 tags, attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser when they interact with a playlist containing the manipulated audio file.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  The injected script can be used to steal cookies, session data, or perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.
- **Site Defacement:**  Attackers could potentially use the injected script to deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Media File Upload:** An attacker with the ability to upload media files (e.g., an Editor or Administrator) uploads a specially crafted MP3 file containing malicious JavaScript code within its ID3 metadata.
- **Playlist Shortcode:**  A user (Contributor or higher) uses the playlist shortcode to embed the malicious MP3 file into a post or page.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the page containing the malicious playlist, either through the `<noscript>` tag or via DOM manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Account with Media Upload Capability:** The attacker needs a WordPress account with the ability to upload media files (e.g., Editor or Administrator role is sufficient).
- **Knowledge of ID3 Tag Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft an MP3 file with malicious JavaScript injected within its ID3 tags.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects WordPress versions 4.7.2 and earlier.
- The issue is fixed in WordPress version 4.7.3.
- The vulnerability is present both for users with and without Javascript enabled.
- The vulnerability is present in the playlist shortcode functionality.
- A proof of concept mp3 file is linked in the report.
