| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20170621-vpc  First Published: 2017 June 21 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvc01665](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvc01665)  [CSCvc35565](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvc35565)     CVE-2017-6678     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2017-6678     CWE-399       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the ingress UDP packet processing functionality of Cisco Virtualized Packet Core−Distributed Instance (VPC−DI) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause both control function (CF) instances on an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Virtualized Packet Core−Distributed Instance (VPC−DI) Software running any release of the Cisco StarOS operating system prior to the first fixed release.  To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco StarOS is running on a VPC-DI instance, administrators can use the **show version** command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a VPC−DI instance that is running Cisco StarOS Release 19.3.v5 (VPC−DI Release N4.2.5):  ```   [local]VPC-001# show versionActive Software:  Image Version:                  19.3.v5  Image Build Number:             65002  Image Description:              Deployment_Build  Image Date:                     Wed Sep 14 05:35:14 EDT 2016  Boot Image:                     /flash/qvpc-di-19.3.v5.bin   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Virtualized Packet Core−Single Instance (VPC−SI) Software   + ASR 5000 Series Aggregation Services Routers   + Elastic Services Controllers   + Ultra Automation Services  Details  * A DI network interconnects the virtual machines (VMs) in a VPC−DI instance to enable the VMs to communicate with each other. The DI network should be a unique, isolated network reserved for the exclusive use of a single VPC−DI instance. No other devices should be connected to the DI network. If more than one VPC−DI instance is instantiated in the same data center, each instance should have its own DI network.  To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the DI network interface of a VPC−DI instance via IPv4.  The vulnerable code exists only in VPC−DI Software. This vulnerability does not exist in Cisco VPC−SI Software or the other Cisco products listed in the “Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable” section.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html)  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**  In the following table, the first column lists major releases of Cisco VPC−DI Software and, parenthetically, the associated release of the Cisco StarOS operating system. The second and third columns indicate the first minor release that includes the fix for the Cisco bugs associated with this vulnerability. The fourth column indicates the recommended release to install to address this vulnerability.  Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:       | Cisco VPC−DI Software and Cisco StarOS Major Release | First Fixed Release for Cisco Bug CSCvc01665 | First Fixed Release for Cisco Bug CSCvc35565 | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | N4.0 (19.2) | N4.2.6 (19.3.v6) | N4.2.7 (19.3.v7) | N4.2.7 (19.3.v7) or later |   | N4.2 (19.3) | N4.2.6 (19.3.v6) | N4.2.7 (19.3.v7) | N4.2.7 (19.3.v7) or later |   | N4.5 (20.0) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) or later |   | N4.6 (20.1) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) or later |   | N4.7 (20.2) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) | N4.7.2 (20.2.v2) or later |   | N5.0 (21.0) | Not affected | N5.1 (21.1.v0) | N5.1 (21.1.v0) or later |   | N5.1 (21.1) | Not affected | Not affected | Not affected |         Customers with active service contracts can download fixed software releases from the [Cisco File Exchange](https://upload.cisco.com/cgi-bin/swc/fileexg/main.cgi?CONTYPES=MITG_ASR5K_Software_Releases).
