Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-6452:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Windows installer for NTP uses `strcat()` to append a string to a stack buffer in the `addSourceToRegistry()` function. This stack buffer is smaller than the buffer in the calling `main()` function, and when combined with the initially copied registry path, it leads to a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow in the Windows installer during registry modification.
- Use of `strcat()` without proper bounds checking.
- Stack buffer size mismatch between calling and called functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack frame overwrite. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution by a local user.
- Denial of service (due to crashing).

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attacker with the ability to execute the NTP Windows installer.
- Exploitation occurs via a crafted command-line argument passed to the Windows installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable Windows installer locally.
- The attacker must supply a sufficiently long command-line argument to cause the buffer overflow during registry path processing.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected buffer is 70 bytes smaller in the `addSourceToRegistry()` than in `main()`.
- The application path passed to the installer is limited to 256 bytes by the OS, which is still large enough to cause the overflow.
- The vulnerability is specific to the Windows installer and affects all versions up to, but not including, 4.2.8p10 and 4.3.0 up to, but not including, 4.3.94.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Cure53.
- The fix was released in NTP version 4.2.8p10.
