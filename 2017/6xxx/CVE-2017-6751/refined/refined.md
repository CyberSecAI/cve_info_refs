Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the web proxy functionality of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA). Specifically, it's an issue with how the WSA handles traffic forwarding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling (CWE-20):** The vulnerability stems from the WSA's failure to properly validate or sanitize traffic. This allows an attacker to manipulate traffic in such a way that it gets forwarded to an unintended destination.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended access control mechanisms, forwarding traffic from the web proxy interface to the administrative management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Integrity Impact:** The attacker can potentially manipulate the traffic flow, which could lead to unauthorized actions or information modification within the administrative interface.
*   Although the CVSS score indicates a low Integrity Impact ("I:L"), the ability to forward traffic to the administrative interface could enable further exploitation (depending on the specific functionality available on this interface) and would definitely be considered to have a higher impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (AV:N):** The attack can be launched remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access (PR:N):** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction (UI:N):** The attack does not require any interaction from a user on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected Cisco WSA's web proxy interface. This implies they should be on the same network or be able to route to the WSA.
*   The attacker must also have enough knowledge of the WSA to manipulate traffic so that it will be forwarded to the administrative interface.
*   No specific privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both virtual and hardware versions of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).
*   There are no workarounds available that fully mitigate the issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Daniel Jensen of Security-Assessment.com.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
*   The provided CVSS vector is: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N` which translates to a base score of 5.3.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass intended access controls on the Cisco WSA. By manipulating network traffic sent to the WSA's web proxy, the attacker can forward that traffic to the WSA's administrative interface. This could potentially lead to further exploitation, although the current information only suggests the ability to cause "low" integrity impact.
