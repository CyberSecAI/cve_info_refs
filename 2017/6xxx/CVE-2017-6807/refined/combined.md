# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Security fix

Fix a cross-site session transfer vulnerability. mod\_auth\_mellon version 0.13.0 and older failed to validate that the session specified in the user's session cookie was created for the web site the user actually accesses.

If two different web sites are hosted on the same web server, and both web sites use mod\_auth\_mellon for authentication, this vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker with access to one of the web sites to copy their session cookie to the other web site, and then use the same session to get access to the other web site.

Thanks to François Kooman for reporting this vulnerability.

This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2017-6807](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-25ph-rcq4-c44c "CVE-2017-6807").

Note: The fix for this vunlerability makes mod\_auth\_mellon validate that the cookie parameters used when creating the session match the cookie parameters that should be used when accessing the current page. If you currently use mod\_auth\_mellon across multiple subdomains, you must make sure that you set the `MellonCookie`-option to the same value on all domains.

## Bug fixes

* Fix segmentation fault if a (trusted) identity provider returns a SAML 2.0 attribute without a Name.
* Fix segmentation fault if `MellonPostReplay` is enabled but `MellonPostDirectory` is not set.
