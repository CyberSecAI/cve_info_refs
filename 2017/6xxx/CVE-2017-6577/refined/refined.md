Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerabilities found in the Mail-Masta 1.0 WordPress plugin:

**Root Cause:**
The primary cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. The plugin directly incorporates GET and POST parameters into SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The plugin suffers from multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities across various files, including:
   - `csvexport.php`: Unauthenticated SQL injection via `list_id` GET parameter.
   - `view-list.php`: SQL injection via `filter_list` GET parameter (requires WordPress admin).
   - `count_of_send.php`: SQL injection via `camp_id` POST parameter (requires WordPress admin).
   - `campaign_save.php`: SQL injection via `list_id` POST parameter (requires WordPress admin).
    -  `view-campaign-list.php`: SQL injection via `id` GET parameter (requires WordPress admin)
    - `view-campaign.php`: SQL injection via `id` GET parameter (requires WordPress admin)
   - `add_member.php`: SQL injection via `filter_list` GET parameter (requires WordPress admin).
   - `edit-list.php`: SQL injection via `id` GET parameter (requires WordPress admin).
   - `edit_member.php`: SQL injection via `filter_list` and `member_id` GET parameters (requires WordPress admin).
   - `campaign-delete.php`: SQL injection via `id` GET parameter (requires WordPress admin).
    - `subscriber_list.php`: SQL injection via `list_id` POST parameter and `email` POST parameter.

The vulnerabilities exist because the plugin utilizes vulnerable code patterns where user inputs like `list_id`, `filter_list`, `camp_id` and `email` are directly embedded into SQL queries without proper sanitization.  For example, in `csvexport.php`, ` $check_sql = "SELECT * FROM $mail_subscribers WHERE list_id = $list_id";`  shows direct insertion of the `$list_id` parameter into the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
  - **Read sensitive data:** Access all data stored in the WordPress database tables related to the plugin, potentially including user information, email lists, and campaign details.
  - **Modify data:** Alter or delete data within the database, potentially corrupting email lists, campaign configurations, or even user accounts.
  - **Execute arbitrary SQL queries:** Potentially gain complete control of the database, allowing for the execution of arbitrary SQL commands which can lead to complete compromise of the Wordpress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors involve sending specially crafted requests with malicious SQL code within the GET or POST parameters.
   - Unauthenticated users can exploit `csvexport.php` through crafted `list_id` GET parameter in the URL.
  - Authenticated WordPress administrators can exploit other vulnerable files through crafted GET or POST parameters on respective pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - For the `csvexport.php` vulnerability, the attacker requires no authentication or special access.
  - For the other identified vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with WordPress administrator privileges.
