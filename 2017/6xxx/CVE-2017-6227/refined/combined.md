#### Summary Security Advisory ID : BSA-2018-526 Component : Fabric OS IPv6 stack Revision : 2.0: Final

A vulnerability in the IPv6 stack on Brocade Fibre Channel SAN products running Brocade Fabric OS (FOS) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and device hang) condition by sending crafted Router Advertisement (RA) messages to a targeted system. All versions of Brocade Fabric OS are affected.
