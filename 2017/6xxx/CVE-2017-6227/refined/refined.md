- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the IPv6 stack of Brocade Fabric OS, specifically related to the processing of Router Advertisement (RA) messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of crafted Router Advertisement (RA) messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can cause a denial of service condition by sending crafted RA messages. This results in high CPU consumption and a device hang, disrupting normal operations.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the network, specifically by sending malicious IPv6 RA messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the targeted system. They must also be able to send crafted IPv6 RA messages.
