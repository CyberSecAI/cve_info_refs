Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `admin.shop.php` file. The application directly uses the value of the `id` parameter from the HTTP request within the HTML output without proper encoding or validation.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the `id` parameter in the URL. Because the server echoes this unsanitized input back to the user's browser, the script will be executed by the victim's browser.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
        *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
        *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
        *   Defacing the website.
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload in the `id` parameter.
    *   **Social Engineering:** The attacker then tricks the victim into clicking the malicious URL, for example, via email, chat or other means.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload.
    *   The attacker needs to persuade the victim to click on the malicious link.

**Additional details**

* The vulnerable code is located on line 36 of `MaNGOSWebV4-master/inc/admin/template_files/admin.shop.php`.
* The example URL provided is:
  `http://your-web-root/MaNGOSWebV4-master/inc/admin/template_files/admin.shop.php?id="><script>alert(1);</script><"`
* The `alert(1)` is a test payload, however, more malicious scripts can be injected
