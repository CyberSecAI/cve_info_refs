Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the web framework of the Cisco Firepower Management Center. Specifically, it's a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the Firepower Management Center's web interface.
*   When a user interacts with the compromised part of the web interface, the attacker's injected script is executed in the user's browser.
*   This allows the attacker to potentially:
    *   Steal session cookies and hijack user sessions.
    *   Modify content displayed on the page.
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    *   Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session.
*   The impact is rated as "Low" for confidentiality and integrity, and "None" for availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with "Low" privileges. This means that the attacker needs to have valid credentials for the Firepower Management Center to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim user needs to interact with the crafted content for the attack to be successful. This is a "User Interaction Required" vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   The advisory indicates that it is a *stored* XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server rather than simply being reflected back to the user.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 5.4, which is considered a medium severity vulnerability.
