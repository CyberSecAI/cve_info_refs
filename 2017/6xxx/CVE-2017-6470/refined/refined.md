Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the IAX2 dissector in Wireshark. Specifically, the `iax2_add_ts_fields` function can enter an infinite loop due to a malformed IAX2 packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Infinite loop vulnerability in the IAX2 dissector.
- The dissector does not properly handle malformed packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial of service. This can be achieved by injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by providing a malformed packet trace file to be read by Wireshark.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** Injecting a specially crafted IAX2 packet onto the network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Malicious PCAP Files:** Providing a malformed packet trace file (PCAP) to a user who then opens it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject network traffic into a network being monitored by Wireshark.
- Alternatively, the attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PCAP file to a Wireshark user.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.4
- Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.10

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark 2.2.5
- Wireshark 2.0.11

**Additional Notes**
- A PCAP file (`iax2_add_ts_fields_busyloop.pcap`) that triggers the vulnerability was provided as an attachment to the bug report.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Otto Airamo and Antti Levom√§ki from Forcepoint.
