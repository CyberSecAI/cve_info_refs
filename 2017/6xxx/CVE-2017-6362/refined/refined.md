  "cve": "CVE-2017-6362",
  "description": "Double free vulnerability in the gdImagePngPtr function in libgd2 before 2.2.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors related to a palette with no colors.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a double free in the `gdImagePngPtr` function. This function processes image data to prepare it for PNG encoding. A specific condition involving a palette with no colors leads to memory being freed twice.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Double-free vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service. The double-free can lead to program crashes and make the application or service unavailable.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered via vectors related to a palette with no colors in an image processed by `gdImagePngPtr`."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide or manipulate image data that leads to the problematic execution path within `gdImagePngPtr`.",
        "details": "The `gdImagePngPtr` function in libgd2, prior to version 2.2.5, exhibits a double-free vulnerability. This vulnerability arises when processing image data, specifically under conditions involving a palette with no defined colors. When this condition is encountered within the `gdImagePngPtr` function, a memory region is freed more than once. This double-free can corrupt memory management, leading to crashes and denial of service."
