Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-6086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in multiple functionalities within the ViMbAdmin application. Specifically, the application doesn't implement proper checks to verify the origin of requests, allowing malicious actors to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The identified vulnerabilities are:
-   CSRF vulnerability in adding an administrator user.
-   CSRF vulnerability in removing an administrator user.
-   CSRF vulnerability in changing an administrator's password.
-   CSRF vulnerability in adding a mailbox address.
-   CSRF vulnerability in purging a mailbox.
-   CSRF vulnerability in archiving a mailbox.
-   CSRF vulnerability in adding an alias address.
-   CSRF vulnerability in removing an alias address.

These vulnerabilities stem from the absence of CSRF tokens or other appropriate measures in the vulnerable functions (`addAction`, `purgeAction`, and `passwordAction` methods in multiple controllers).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can have a high impact:
-   **Loss of confidentiality:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information through account takeover (admin, mailboxes).
-   **Loss of integrity:** Attackers can modify the state of the application by adding, removing, or altering user accounts, mailboxes and aliases. This includes modifying user passwords, which could lead to further compromise.
-   **Loss of availability:** Attackers can disrupt the service by removing critical accounts, mailboxes and aliases.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through a malicious website or email. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with JavaScript that submits forged requests to the vulnerable ViMbAdmin application. This attack requires the targeted administrator to visit the malicious page while being logged into ViMbAdmin. The attacker leverages the administrator's active session and valid cookies in their browser to execute the forged requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the following capabilities/position:
-   Ability to craft malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
-   Ability to host or deliver the malicious page to a logged-in administrator.
-   No prior knowledge of the system beyond the vulnerable endpoints and parameters is required. The attacker does need to know the administrator IDs for some of the attacks.

The provided content details the CSRF vulnerabilities present in ViMbAdmin v3.0.15 and provides a clear explanation of how they can be exploited. It also includes proof-of-concept code for each vulnerability.
