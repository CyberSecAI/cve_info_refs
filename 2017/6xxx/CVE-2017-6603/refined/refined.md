Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Cisco ASR 903 and ASR 920 Series Devices handle IPv6 packets when equipped with an RSP2 card.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper processing of IPv6 packets.
- The specific weakness is not described in detail, only that it leads to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS condition on the targeted system, likely by exhausting system resources.
- High CPU usage is an indicator of successful exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must be on the same Layer 2 network segment as the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials.
- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the same local network segment as the vulnerable device, allowing them to send malicious IPv6 packets to it.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability only affects ASR 903 and ASR 920 series devices with an RSP2 card. Devices with RSP1 or RSP3 are not affected.
*   There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing.
*   There is no evidence of public exploitation or malicious use of this vulnerability.
