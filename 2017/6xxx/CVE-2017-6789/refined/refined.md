Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Cisco Unified Intelligence Center web interface. This flaw allows for the execution of a Document Object Model (DOM)-based cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS flaw. This means the XSS payload is executed within the user's browser using the DOM instead of being directly reflected by the server. This occurs because the client-side JavaScript code processes data that originates from an attacker-controlled source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Integrity Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to impact the integrity of the system by executing arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session.
*   **Limited Confidentiality Impact:** The vulnerability is also rated with a low confidentiality impact.
*   **No Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has no impact on the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (AV:N):** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated (PR:N):** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** The attacker needs to trick a user to interact with the malicious payload, which is typical for XSS attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send or inject malicious javascript code or data to the vulnerable application.
*   They do not need authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
*   They must induce a user to interact with the malicious link or content.
