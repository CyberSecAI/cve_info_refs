Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `load_apng` function of the `apng2gif` software. Specifically, the `imagesize` variable is calculated based on user-controlled width (`w`) and height (`h`) values from the input PNG file. If these values are manipulated to cause an integer overflow during the calculation, `imagesize` will be smaller than the actual memory required for the image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation or handling of the multiplication of width and height, leading to an integer overflow when calculating the `imagesize`.
- **Heap-based Buffer Over-read/Write:** Due to the insufficient `imagesize` value, memory is allocated based on the overflowed size which is too small to hold the actual image data. When the program attempts to copy image data into the buffer allocated with the incorrect size, it leads to an out-of-bounds read/write on the heap. The vulnerability was initially reported as a heap buffer over-read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow Read/Write:** An attacker can craft a malicious APNG file with large width and height values to trigger an integer overflow, which then leads to memory corruption via heap overflow. This results in a read/write out of bounds.
- **Potential for Sensitive Information Exposure or Code Execution:** While the initial report focused on heap buffer over-read, there's potential for a heap overflow write which could expose sensitive information or, under specific conditions, lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Crash:** The immediate consequence is a crash, observed as a segmentation fault.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious APNG File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted APNG file. The attacker manipulates the width and height values within the APNG data to trigger the integer overflow.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `apng2gif` tool attempts to load and process this malformed APNG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious APNG file to the `apng2gif` utility, typically through a command-line argument or some other file input method.
- **No Special Privileges:** Exploitation does not require any special user privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `apng2gif` versions prior to 1.8.
- The issue is present in the `LoadAPNG` function.
-  The vulnerability was introduced after version 1.5 due to a refactoring and it is also present in version 1.5.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by modifying the h and w variables in a png file to overflow the imagesize variable
