| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco WebEx Network Recording Player Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20170621-wnrp  First Published: 2017 June 21 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2017 June 26 15:12 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvc47758](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvc47758)  [CSCvc51227](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvc51227)  [CSCvc51242](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvc51242)     CVE-2017-6669     CWE-119       CVSS Score: [Base 7.3](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2017-6669     CWE-119       Email      Summary  * Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious ARF file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected player to crash and, in some cases, could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects the Cisco WebEx ARF Player. The following client builds are affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS29) client builds prior to T29.13.130   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30) client builds prior to T30.17   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.10To determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the **Support > Downloads** section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under "About Support Center."      Alternatively, version information of the Cisco WebEx Meeting client can be accessed from within the Cisco WebEx Meeting client. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Windows and Linux platforms can be viewed by choosing **Help > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center**. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Mac platforms can be viewed by choosing **Meeting Center > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center**.      The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 29.32.16 is fixed, build 29.32.17 will contain updated software. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T29 SP32 EP16, which shows that the server is running client build 29.32.16.      **Note:** Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the Cisco WebEx WRF Player.  Details  * The Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS) meeting services are a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The Cisco WebEx Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds.      The ARF file format is used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site.      The Cisco WebEx ARF Player is an application that is used to play back and edit WebEx ARF recording files (files with *.arf* extensions).      The Cisco WebEx ARF Player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream playback mode). The Cisco WebEx ARF Player can also be manually installed after downloading the application from <http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html> to play back recording files for offline playback.      The Cisco WebEx ARF Player is available for all Cisco WebEx Business Suite clients (WBS29, WBS30, and WBS31), Cisco WebEx Meetings, and for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients.      Exploitation of this vulnerability may cause player applications to crash or, in some cases, remote code execution could occur.      To exploit this vulnerability, the player application would need to open a malicious ARF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using email), or by directing a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, it is possible to remove all WebEx software completely from a system using the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X users) available at <https://help.webex.com/docs/DOC-2672>.      Removal of WebEx software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the WebEx knowledge base help article at the following link: [https://support.webex.com/MyAccountWeb/knowledgeBase.do?root=Tools&parent=Knowledge&articleId=WBX28548&txtSearchQuery=uninstall%20linux#](https://support.webex.com/MyAccountWeb/knowledgeBase.do?root=Tools&parent=Knowledge&articleId=WBX28548&txtSearchQuery=uninstall%20linux).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html)      Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.      **Customers Without Service Contracts**      Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>      Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.      **Fixed Releases**      The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS29, WBS30, WBS31) address this vulnerability:   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS29) client builds T29.13.130 or later   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30) client builds T30.17 or later   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds T31.10 or laterTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the **Support > Downloads** section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under "About Support Center." The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 29.32.16 is fixed, build 29.32.17 will contain updated software.      Users who have downloaded the ARF player directly from the WebEx site can update their player manually by downloading the application from <http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html>.      **NOTE:** Users whose WebEx Business Suites are on lockdown will need to contact WebEx Support to apply the appropriate patch to their WebEx site.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.3 |
