    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2017-6531",
      "root_cause": "Lack of access control on the restore backup functionality.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate access control on the restore backup function allows a low-privileged user to modify the device's configuration."
      ],
      "impact": "A low-privileged user can change the device's configuration, including administrative credentials, by restoring a modified backup file, potentially leading to full device compromise.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "By sending a crafted POST request containing a modified configuration file to the `/ReadFile.cgi` endpoint, followed by accessing `/result.shtml?method=LoadCfgFile&result=0&cfgfile=/tmp/s<timestamp>` to load the configuration and `/result.shtml?method=Reboot` to reboot the device"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the device's web interface with a low-privileged user account to send the crafted requests."
