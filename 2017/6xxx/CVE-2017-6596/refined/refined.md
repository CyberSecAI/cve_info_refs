Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6596:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in `partclone.chkimg`, specifically when handling a maliciously crafted image file.
*   The program fails to properly validate the `totalblock` value within the image header. This value is located at offset 0x35 to 0x37 of the image file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  Due to insufficient validation of the `totalblock` value, `partclone.chkimg` attempts to allocate a bitmap in memory with a size based on the crafted `totalblock`. A large `totalblock` value can lead to the allocation of an excessively large memory region and subsequent out-of-bounds write when accessing the bitmap causing a heap overflow.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is that `partclone.chkimg` does not properly check the validity of the data within the image header, specifically the `totalblock` field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. The heap overflow leads to a segmentation fault (memory crash), terminating the `partclone.chkimg` process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Image File:** An attacker needs to create a specially crafted image file for `partclone.chkimg` to process. The image will contain a large value in the `totalblock` field.
*   **Local File:** The `partclone.chkimg` tool is used locally on the system which the attacker has access to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a malicious image file to the `partclone.chkimg` utility on the vulnerable system.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without needing elevated privileges.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must run the `partclone.chkimg` tool with the crafted image as input.
