| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=779016#c0)  Ariel Zelivansky    2017-02-21 13:04:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 346319](attachment.cgi?id=346319 "An icns file with icns to demonstrate infinite loop/out-of-bounds read") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=346319&action=edit "An icns file with icns to demonstrate infinite loop/out-of-bounds read") An icns file with icns to demonstrate infinite loop/out-of-bounds read  In the load_resources function (io-icns.c:63), inside the size switch (line 101), all the cases set plen or mlen to: blocklen - sizeof (IcnsBlockHeader); See lines 109, 117, 127, 134, 139, 146, 151, 158 and 163. blocklen is set in line 95:  blocklen = GUINT32_FROM_BE (header->size);  There are no checks on the size of blocklen and if it is set to less than sizeof (IcnsBlockHeader) (should be 8) there is an integer underflow.  This is dangerous because it's value is later passed to gdk_pixbuf_loader_write (line 262) when size is 256. This allows an attacker to craft a file that will end up calling to a desired loader with a bogus size that is much larger than the actual buffer size.  Possible exploits of the bug:  1. adding a bmp, or a an ico image data after the header will cause an out-of-buffer read (again when count>actual buffer size).  2. With a tiff image it would lead to an infinite loop 3. With a gif, a tga or another icns after the header the code will try to allocate as much as count bytes (and most likely fail on a size of 2^32-1) 4. With another icns it is possible to reach another out-of-bounds read that reads zeros and leads to an infinite loop  Certainly there may be more to that but that's what I found from a quick trial and error.  I tested this on Arch Linux and on Ubuntu 16.04.1 (both 32-bit and 64-bit versions). ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=779016#c1)  Ariel Zelivansky    2017-02-21 13:05:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 346320](attachment.cgi?id=346320 "Example of segmentation fault (out-of-bounds read) with ico inside") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=346320&action=edit "Example of segmentation fault (out-of-bounds read) with ico inside") Example of segmentation fault (out-of-bounds read) with ico inside ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=779016#c2)  Ariel Zelivansky    2017-02-21 14:00:37 UTC  ``` Also perhaps postpone the call gdk_pixbuf_loader_write and first validate the file is actually JPEG 2000 if it is only used to reading JPEG 2000 images ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=779016#c3)  Bastien Nocera    2017-12-05 11:00:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 365016](attachment.cgi?id=365016 "icns: Protect against too short blocklen (CVE-2017-6313)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365016&action=edit "icns: Protect against too short blocklen (CVE-2017-6313)") [[review]](review?bug=779016&attachment=365016) icns: Protect against too short blocklen (CVE-2017-6313)  The blocklen needs to be at least header sized to be valid, otherwise we can underflow picture data or mask data lengths. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=779016#c4)  Bastien Nocera    2017-12-05 11:00:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 365017](attachment.cgi?id=365017 "tests: Add test for bug 779016") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365017&action=edit "tests: Add test for bug 779016") [[review]](review?bug=779016&attachment=365017) tests: Add test for [bug 779016](show_bug.cgi?id=779016 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer underflow in io-icns.c") ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=779016#c5)  Bastien Nocera    2017-12-05 11:02:08 UTC  ``` [Attachment 365016](attachment.cgi?id=365016 "icns: Protect against too short blocklen (CVE-2017-6313)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365016&action=edit "icns: Protect against too short blocklen (CVE-2017-6313)") pushed as [210b163](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/commit/?id=210b163) - icns: Protect against too short blocklen (CVE-2017-6313) [Attachment 365017](attachment.cgi?id=365017 "tests: Add test for bug 779016") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365017&action=edit "tests: Add test for bug 779016") pushed as [4cc39d4](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/commit/?id=4cc39d4) - tests: Add test for [bug 779016](show_bug.cgi?id=779016 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer underflow in io-icns.c") ``` |  |

Subject: CVE Request - Multiple vulnerabilities in gdk-pixbuf

Hello,

I just reported several vulnerabilities in gdk-pixbuf. I am adding the
relevant details but you can also refer to the bug reports in the links. If
suitable please assign CVEs.

1. An dangerous integer underflow in io-icns.c [1]
--------------------------------------------------
io-icns.c is the source code for the loader of Macintosh icons.

An integer underflow I found allows an attacker to lead to different calls
to gdk_pixbuf_loader_write with a huge (2^32-1) count (size of buffer) that
can be bigger than the actual size of given buffer. It is possible to give
the loader any data we want so we can call any desired loader that it's
data is recognized. This may lead to various behaviors - multiple
out-of-buffer reads, infinite loops, or allocation attempt with the size.
Possibly other behaviors I did not test for (I didn't really check all
available loaders).

1.1 The bug
-----------
In the load_resources function (io-icns.c:63), inside the size switch (line
101), all the cases set plen or mlen to: blocklen - sizeof
(IcnsBlockHeader);
See lines 109, 117, 127, 134, 139, 146, 151, 158 and 163.
blocklen is set in line 95:

blocklen = GUINT32_FROM_BE (header->size);

There are no checks on the size of blocklen and if it is set to less than
sizeof (IcnsBlockHeader) (should be 8) there is an integer underflow.

This is dangerous because it's value is later passed to
gdk_pixbuf_loader_write (line 262) when size is 256. This allows an
attacker to craft a file that will end up calling to a desired loader with
a bogus size that is much larger than the actual buffer size.

Possible exploits of the bug:
1. Adding a bmp, or a an ico image data after the header will cause an
out-of-buffer read.
2. With a tiff image it would lead to an infinite loop (see bug 2).
3. With a gif, a tga or another icns after the header the code will try to
allocate as much as count bytes (and most likely fail on a size of 2^32-1).
Otherwise if the actual data size is less than 4096 there is an
out-of-bounds read.
4. With another icns it is possible to reach another out-of-bounds
4.1 If this out-of-bounds read gets zeros we will have an infinite loop

2. Infinite loop in io-tiff.c [2]
---------------------------------
This loader for tiff images will try and allocate a buffer as big as size
given to it. It calls the make_available_at_least function to do that.
The problem is in the function itself (from line 499):

if (need_alloc > context->allocated) {
    guint new_size = 1;
    while (new_size < need_alloc)
        new_size *= 2;
...

new_size starts with 1 and multiplies until it is larger or equal to
need_alloc. If need_alloc is larger than 2^31, new_size will become 2^31
and multiply itself in 2, and become 0. This would lead to an infinite loop.

3. Out-of-bounds read on io-ico.c [3]
-------------------------------------
io-ico.c is the source code for the loader of Windows icons.

State->HeaderSize is calculated in line 334:
State->HeaderSize = entry->DIBoffset + INFOHEADER_SIZE
entry->DIBoffset is read directly from the data

An integer overflow seems possible. However in line 336 it is checked if
(State->HeaderSize < 0), to prevent such overflow.
This works when compiling without or with basic optimization (in gcc, -O0
or -O1), but from -O2 this check seems to be ignored. Specifically when
compiled with "O1 -fstrict-overflow -ftree-vrp".
I believe many distributions are building with these flags.

When this is overflown it is possible later to reach a segmentation fault
thanks to an out-of-bounds read of the BIH variable (line 359: BIH =
Data+entry->DIBoffset;).

I tested this both on Arch and on Ubuntu 16.04.1 but it certainly affects
other distributions as well.

4. NULL dereference on gdk-pixbuf-thumbnailer [4]
-------------------------------------------------
This is a bug in gnome-thumbnailer-skeleton.c and it affects only the
latest versions of gdk-pixbuf (since moving the code from gnome-desktop the
the external thumbnailer in gdk-pixbuf[5]).

gnome-thumbnailer-skeleton.c:272 calls file_to_pixbuf. file_to_pixbuf
(gdk-pixbuf-thumbnailer.c:209) calls _gdk_pixbuf_new_from_uri_at_scale,
which calls gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf (see gdk-pixbuf-thumbnailer:195).
gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf may returns NULL, and it doesn't get a pointer
to an error object to set an error.
So when it returns NULL, on file_to_pixbuf pixbuf will be NULL, and on line
312 printing error->message will result in a NULL deference (error->message
will be 0x0 + 0x8).

5. Impact
---------
These bugs can break many binaries that rely on gdk-pixbuf and I can think
of various ways these bugs can be used maliciously. Obvious applications
are to cause DoS by segmentation faults or possibly by CPU exhaustion (with
the infinite loops) when possible. Besides crashing the thumbnailer and
some other desktop applications that use gdk-pixbuf I also managed to crash
Chromium and Firefox on Ubuntu (on both via their file browser which use
gdk-pixbuf). To see the full list of packages that use gdk-pixbuf on apt
based distributions run `apt-cache rdepends libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0
libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev`.

Thanks to afl for helping me find bugs 3 and 4.

Package        : gdk-pixbuf
Version        : 2.31.1-2+deb8u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-6352 CVE-2017-2870 CVE-2017-6312 CVE-2017-6313
                 CVE-2017-6314

Several issues in gdk-pixbuf, a library to handle pixbuf, have been found.

CVE-2016-6352
     fix for denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) via
     crafted dimensions in an ICO file

CVE-2017-2870
     Fix for an exploitable integer overflow vulnerability in the
     tiff_image_parse functionality. When software is compiled with
     clang, A specially crafted tiff file can cause a heap-overflow
     resulting in remote code execution. Debian package is compiled
     with gcc and is not affected, but probably some downstream is.

CVE-2017-6312
     Fix for an integer overflow in io-ico.c that allows attackers
     to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and application
     crash) via a crafted image

CVE-2017-6313
     Fix for an integer underflow in the load_resources function in
     io-icns.c that allows attackers to cause a denial of service
     (out-of-bounds read and program crash) via a crafted image entry
     size in an ICO file

CVE-2017-6314
     Fix for an infinite loop in the make_available_at_least function
     in io-tiff.c that allows attackers to cause a denial of service
     via a large TIFF file.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.31.1-2+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your gdk-pixbuf packages.

[bug automatically created by: add-tracking-bugs]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1378897#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-09-23 13:19:13 UTC  ```  Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1378894,1378897  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [CVE-2015-7552](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-7552)  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1378897#c2)  Fedora Admin XMLRPC Client    2017-01-05 20:57:54 UTC  ``` This package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.  Reassigning to the new owner of this component.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1378897#c3)  Fedora Admin XMLRPC Client    2017-01-05 21:08:05 UTC  ``` This package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.  Reassigning to the new owner of this component.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1378897#c4)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-07-25 23:12:50 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 24 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 2 (two) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 24. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '24'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 24 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1378897#c5)  Jan Kurik    2017-08-08 11:32:00 UTC  ``` Fedora 24 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2017-08-08. Fedora 24 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates.  As this is a security big we are moving this bug to the currently latest supported release. Please check whether this bug is still applicable.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1378897#c6)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-11-16 19:07:13 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 25 is nearing its end of life.

In compliance with FESCo decision how to handle EOL of Security issues [1], I am changing the version to '27', the latest supported release.  Please check whether this bug is still an issue on the '27' release. If you find this bug not being applicable on this release, please close it.
