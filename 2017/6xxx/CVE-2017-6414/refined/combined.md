Subject: CVE-2017-6414 Qemu: libcacard: host memory leakage while creating
 new APDU

   Hello,

The CAC(Common Access Card) library, used by Quick Emulator(Qemu) to implement
smartcard support, is vulnerable to a host memory leakage issue. It could
occur while allocating a new APDU object using guest supplied raw byte stream
in 'vcard_apdu_new'.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/libcacard/commit/?id=9113dc6a303604a2d9812ac70c17d076ef11886c>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427833>

This issue was reported by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.

'CVE-2017-6414' assigned via -> <http://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1427833#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2017-03-01 11:05:34 UTC  ``` The CAC(Common Access Card) library, used by Quick Emulator(Qemu) to implement smartcard support, is vulnerable to a host memory leakage issue. It could occur while allocating a new APDU object using guest supplied raw byte stream in 'vcard_apdu_new'.  A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in DoS.  Upstream patch: ---------------   -> <https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/libcacard/commit/?id=9113dc6a303604a2d9812ac70c17d076ef11886c>  Reference: ----------   -> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/03/01/11>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1427833#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2017-03-01 11:05:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Li Qiang (360.cn Inc.)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1427833#c2)  Prasad Pandit    2017-03-01 11:06:37 UTC  ```  Created libcacard tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1427834](show_bug.cgi?id=1427834 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-6414 Qemu: libcacard: host memory leakage while creating new APDU [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1427833#c3)  Garth Mollett    2017-07-27 22:16:07 UTC  ``` Created libcacard tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1476037](show_bug.cgi?id=1476037 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2017-6414 libcacard: Qemu: libcacard: host memory leakage while creating new APDU [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1427833#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-02 01:00:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)   Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata)   Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7   Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty)   Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka)  Via RHSA-2017:2408 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2408](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A2408)   ``` |  |

The hosting and maintainance of libcacard is now part of the Spice project.  ``` |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2408)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton), and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

Security Fix(es):

* Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with Network Block Device (NBD) Server support was vulnerable to a null-pointer dereference issue. The flaw could occur when releasing a client that was not initialized due to failed negotiation. A remote user or process could exploit this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server (denial of service). (CVE-2017-9524)
* An information-exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory. (CVE-2016-4020)
* A memory-leak flaw was found in the Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with USB xHCI controller emulation support. The flaw could occur while doing a USB-device unplug operation. Unplugging the device repeatedly resulted in leaking host memory, which affected other services on the host. A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host or potentially crash the host's QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-7466)
* Multiple CVEs were fixed as a result of rebase to QEMU 2.9.0. (CVE-2016-6888, CVE-2016-7422, CVE-2016-8576, CVE-2016-8669, CVE-2016-8909, CVE-2016-8910, CVE-2016-9907, CVE-2016-9911, CVE-2016-9921, CVE-2016-9922, CVE-2016-10155, CVE-2017-5579, CVE-2017-5973, CVE-2017-6414, CVE-2017-8309, CVE-2017-8379, CVE-2017-9310, CVE-2017-9373, CVE-2017-9374, CVE-2017-9375)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
