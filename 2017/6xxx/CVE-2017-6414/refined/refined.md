  "CVE-2017-6414": {
    "description": "The CAC(Common Access Card) library, used by Quick Emulator(Qemu) to implement smartcard support, is vulnerable to a host memory leakage issue. It could occur while allocating a new APDU object using guest supplied raw byte stream in 'vcard_apdu_new'. A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in DoS.",
    "root_cause": "Memory leak in the error path of `vcard_apdu_new` function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest user/process could exploit the vulnerability to leak host memory, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Guest controlled raw byte stream provided to `vcard_apdu_new` which triggers an error path without freeing allocated resources."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A privileged user or process inside the guest virtual machine is required to exploit this issue."
