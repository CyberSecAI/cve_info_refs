{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-6004",
    "description": "The compile_bracket_matchingpath function in pcre_jit_compile.c in PCRE through 8.x before revision 1680 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted regular expression.",
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the `compile_bracket_matchingpath` function of PCRE library when handling a crafted regular expression.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by triggering an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to application crash.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted regular expression as input to a PCRE function which utilizes JIT compilation (specifically through the `pcre_study()` API).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control the regular expression input processed by the vulnerable application. JIT compilation must be enabled via `pcre_study()` with `PCRE_STUDY_JIT_*` flags. "
