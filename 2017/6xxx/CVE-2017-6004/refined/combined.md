| [Description](#c0)  James Cort    2004-08-19 16:07:32 UTC  ``` There are two with k3b under KDE 3.2.3 related to files being in the wrong place.  1. Various images (most noticeably the splash screen) don't appear, making the program look very unprofessional. 2. k3bsetup doesn't work, "Library files for "libkcm_k3bsetup2.la" not found in paths".  Both of these errors are found in both the stable and the most recent unstable ebuilds.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. emerge kde version 3.2.3r1 2. emerge qt version 3.3.3 3. emerge k3b (either the most recent or the unstable)   Actual Results:   Run k3b - you should see something similar to the image referenced above.  Run k3bsetup - you should get the error described above.  Expected Results:   A pretty splash screen should have appeared when running k3b.  k3bsetup should start a program which allows the user to configure various aspects of k3b.  The problem seems to be that a number of files are placed in /usr/share/, /usr/lib/ rather than /usr/kde/....  The splash screen & other graphics issues may be worked around by adding the following symlink:  ln -s /usr/share/apps/k3b  /usr/kde/3.2/share/apps/  The k3bsetup issue may be worked around as follows:  cp /usr/lib/kde3/kcm_k3bsetup2.* /usr/kde/3.2/lib/kde3/  You must be logged in as root to do either of these.  I am logging this as major because the k3bsetup bug effectively prevents an inexperienced user from configuring k3b without a lot of digging around. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Heinrich Wendel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-20 15:11:44 UTC  ``` It works fine here. The files should not be in /usr/kde since they don't belong to the default installation. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Gregorio Guidi (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-26 02:28:17 UTC  ``` Right, all should work well as long as KDEDIRS is defined, could you try running 'KDEDIRS="/usr" k3b' ? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Heinrich Wendel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-08-26 02:46:47 UTC  ``` the locations of the files are correct, could you get it working? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  James Cort    2004-08-26 03:31:26 UTC  ``` I finally found the problem yesterday evening. For some reason, kde-env needed to be re-emerged.  Sorry for the trouble. ``` |  |

# PCRE library: Denial of service — GLSA **201706-11**

A vulnerability in PCRE library allows remote attackers to cause a
Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libpcre** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **8.40-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **8.40-r1** |

### Background

PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5.

### Description

It was found that the compile\_bracket\_matchingpath function in
pcre\_jit\_compile.c in PCRE library is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds
read.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition via
a special crafted regular expression.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PCRE library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre-8.40-r1"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-21 09:39:48 UTC  ``` The compile_bracket_matchingpath function in pcre_jit_compile.c in PCRE through 8.x before revision 1680 (e.g., the PHP 7.1.1 bundled version) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted regular expression.  Upstream patch:  <https://vcs.pcre.org/pcre?view=revision&revision=1680>  Upstream bug:  <https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2035>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-21 10:28:57 UTC  ``` Created glib2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425394](show_bug.cgi?id=1425394 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-6004 glib2: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-glib2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1425392](show_bug.cgi?id=1425392 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-6004 mingw-glib2: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425396](show_bug.cgi?id=1425396 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2017-6004 mingw-glib2: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-pcre tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1425393](show_bug.cgi?id=1425393 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-6004 mingw-pcre: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425391](show_bug.cgi?id=1425391 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-6004 mingw-pcre: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [fedora-all]")]   Created pcre tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425395](show_bug.cgi?id=1425395 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-6004 pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c2)  Richard W.M. Jones    2017-02-21 11:29:14 UTC  ``` virt-p2v (an ISO that we ship in RHEL 7) contains an embedded copy of pcre.  However it does NOT call pcre_jit_compile explicitly.  Do you know if this function can be called implicitly (eg from pcre_compile, which virt-p2v does call)?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c3)  Petr Pisar    2017-02-21 13:58:13 UTC  ``` PCRE does not use JIT by default. An application must request JIT explicitly by calling pcre_study() (pcre16_study() or pcre32_study()) with some of PCRE_STUDY_JIT_* values in the second parameter.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c4)  Fedora Update System    2017-02-22 17:52:06 UTC  ``` pcre-8.40-2.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c11)  Stefan Cornelius    2017-08-25 12:58:23 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of rh-php70-php as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
