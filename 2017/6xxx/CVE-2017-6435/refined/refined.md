Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6435:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `parse_string_node` function in `bplist.c`. This function is responsible for parsing string nodes in binary property lists.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory corruption**: Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by overlapping memory regions during a `memcpy` operation, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer error: `memcpy-param-overlap: memory ranges [0x00000000,0xfff50000) and [0xb58017ce, 0xb57517ce) overlap`. This occurs because the code does not check the size of the string node properly during parsing, which leads to allocation and copying of memory regions that overlap with existing allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service due to the memory corruption. This is caused by the program crashing.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted plist file:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted binary plist file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** According to the Debian security advisory, this is a vulnerability that can be exploited by "local users." This means the attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted plist file to a user of the vulnerable software.

**Additional details:**
- The provided github commit `fbd8494d5e4e46bf2e90cb6116903e404374fb56` shows that a fix was implemented to check for allocation failures in `parse_string_node`, but does not address the memory overlap directly. The allocation failure was triggered by a large allocation, and would lead to a crash and denial of service as well.
- The issue `#93` reported by `zhunki` on github shows the actual memory overlap problem, and provides the stack trace and poc.txt to reproduce the issue.
- The Debian security advisory lists CVE-2017-6435 along with several other vulnerabilities affecting libplist.
