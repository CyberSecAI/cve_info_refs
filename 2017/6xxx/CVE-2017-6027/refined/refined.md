Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The CODESYS Web Server allows the upload of arbitrary files without proper authorization. This is due to a lack of validation on the type and content of the uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** This is the primary vulnerability, where the web server does not properly restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files to the CODESYS Web Server.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful upload of a malicious file could lead to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Application Crash:** The second vulnerability could be exploited to crash the application.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The stack-based buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerabilities are accessible through network requests, meaning they can be exploited remotely over a network connection.
*   **Web Server Request:** Attackers send specially crafted web server requests to exploit the file upload vulnerability and potentially a stack buffer overflow during XML parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable CODESYS Web Server.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory notes that the vulnerabilities are "remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit."
*   **No Credentials Required:** Exploitation does not require any prior authentication or user credentials as indicated by `PR:N` in the CVSS vector.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also mentions a separate vulnerability, **CVE-2017-6025**, a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) present in the same product when handling XML data. This is caused by not verifying string sizes before copying to memory during XML processing, which could cause application crash or remote code execution.
*   The advisory provides mitigation steps, including restricting network access, using firewalls and VPNs, and applying the vendor-provided patch.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by David Atch of CyberX.

In summary, the advisory details a critical vulnerability where an attacker can upload arbitrary files to a vulnerable web server, leading to remote code execution, along with a separate stack-based buffer overflow. The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable and require a low level of skill to exploit, but they need network accessibility to the targeted CODESYS Web Server.
