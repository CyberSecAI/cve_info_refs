- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the `id` HTTP parameter. The `$_GET["id"]` value is directly used in the `users.php` script without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page. When a victim clicks on a specially crafted URL, this malicious code will execute in the victim's browser. This can potentially lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or stealing of sensitive user information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `id` parameter of the `users.php` script. This URL is then sent to a victim (e.g. via email, chat, etc.).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious link and send it to a victim. The victim needs to click on the link to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
