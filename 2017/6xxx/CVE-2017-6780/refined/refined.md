Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the TCP throttling process of the Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND). Specifically, the issue is related to the system's handling of incoming TCP connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient TCP throttling: The system does not properly limit or manage incoming TCP connections.
- Memory consumption: The lack of proper throttling allows an attacker to cause the system to consume excessive memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause the system to run out of memory. This leads to the device restarting, resulting in a denial of service condition.
- System restart: The excessive memory consumption triggers a restart of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
- Unauthenticated access: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote network access: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
- No special privileges: The attacker does not require any authentication or privileges to perform the attack.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-6780 describes a vulnerability in the TCP throttling mechanism of Cisco IoT Field Network Director. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of TCP connections, leading to excessive memory consumption and causing the device to restart, resulting in a denial-of-service. The vulnerability is identified by CWE-399 which is "Resource Management Errors".
