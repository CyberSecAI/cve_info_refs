{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the D-Link DSL-2730U router's web interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CSRF vulnerability in `dnscfg.cgi` allowing DNS settings modification.",
    "CSRF vulnerability in `password.cgi` allowing password changes.",
    "CSRF vulnerability in `lancfg2.cgi` allowing LAN firewall manipulation."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": [
    "DNS settings modification to redirect traffic to malicious sites, enabling phishing and malware distribution.",
    "Password changes for all accounts, leading to complete device control and traffic analysis/denial-of-service.",
      "Disabling the LAN firewall, allowing backdoor access and enabling port scanning."
  ],
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Malicious URLs crafted with specific parameters targetting vulnerable cgi scripts",
    "URLs can be delivered through various means, such as phishing emails or malicious websites, to induce victims to unknowingly trigger the requests."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Attacker needs to be able to induce the victim's browser to send the crafted malicious requests",
     "The attacker does not need any special privileges on the router. Exploitation can be done using the default 'user' account and corresponding password.",
     "Remote access to the router management interface needs to be enabled for external attackers."
  ]
