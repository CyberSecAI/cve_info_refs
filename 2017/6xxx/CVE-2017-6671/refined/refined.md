Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6671:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the email message scanning process of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA). Specifically, it's a flaw in how the software handles attachments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Filter Bypass:** The core vulnerability is a bypass of configured filters on the Cisco ESA device. This means that security filters intended to block or sanitize certain types of email content are being circumvented.
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):**  The provided advisory mentions CWE-20, indicating that the software fails to properly validate input data (likely within the email attachment scanning process), leading to the filter bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Impact:** A successful attack allows an attacker to send malicious email attachments that would otherwise be blocked by the ESA's filters, potentially leading to a modification of the intended behavior of the system. This is categorized as a low integrity impact (I:L)
- **No Confidentiality or Availability Impact:** The exploit does not directly impact the confidentiality (C:N) or availability (A:N) of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):** The attack is initiated remotely over the network via email.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Exploiting this vulnerability is not complex, meaning an attacker doesn't need sophisticated techniques to achieve their goal.
- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** The attacker does not need any existing user credentials or privileges on the target system.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** The attack does not require any interaction from the user to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to have any pre-existing access to the target system or network.
- **Ability to Send Email:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a target that uses the vulnerable Cisco ESA.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- **CVSS Score:** Base score of 5.8, based on the vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
- **Affected Product:** Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) running vulnerable versions of AsyncOS Software.
- **Unaffected Products:** Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) are confirmed to NOT be affected.
- **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability besides patching.
- **Fix Information:** Fixed software releases are mentioned, and users are advised to consult the Cisco bug ID.
- **No Public Exploitation:** Cisco is unaware of any public exploits or malicious use.
- **Discovery:** The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-6671 is a filter bypass vulnerability in Cisco ESA that allows a remote attacker to send malicious email attachments that are not blocked by the appliance's filters.
