Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6058:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the `eth_strip_vlan` function within QEMU's network stack when handling VLAN stripping with the VMXNET3 NIC device. Specifically, the `ehdr_buf` buffer, intended to hold the Ethernet header, is not large enough to accommodate the combined Ethernet header and VLAN header when VLAN stripping is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is a buffer overflow in the `ehdr_buf`. When VLAN stripping is performed, `eth_strip_vlan` can write `sizeof(struct eth_header) + sizeof(struct vlan_header)` bytes into `ehdr_buf`, which is only `sizeof(struct eth_header)` bytes large. This write exceeds the allocated buffer size.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The overflow leads to writing data outside the bounds of allocated memory, which can corrupt memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote user/process can trigger this out-of-bounds write, causing the QEMU process to crash, thus leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided information, memory corruption vulnerabilities like this can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution by a sophisticated attacker.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted network packets to a QEMU instance configured with a vmxnet3 device with VLAN stripping enabled.
- **Remote:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability without requiring local access to the QEMU host.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Remote network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable QEMU instance.
- **VLAN stripping configuration:** The vmxnet3 device in the target QEMU instance must have the 'VLANSTRIP' feature enabled.

**Technical details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `net_rx_pkt.c` file, specifically in the `net_rx_pkt_attach_iovec` or `net_rx_pkt_attach_iovec_ex` functions.
- The issue occurs when `eth_strip_vlan` or `eth_strip_vlan_ex` is called, and the stripped VLAN header is written to the undersized `ehdr_buf`.
- A patch was created to fix the issue by increasing the size of the `ehdr_buf` to `sizeof(struct eth_header) + sizeof(struct vlan_header)` and modifying related functions.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided information suggests that the vulnerability was discovered by Prasad Pandit of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
- The fix involves increasing the `ehdr_buf` size to accommodate the VLAN header and modifying functions to use the correct buffer length.
