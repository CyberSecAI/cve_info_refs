#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

#### Vulnerability Information

Attack Type

Definition

Remote

The vulnerability can be exploited through a network. The attacker may be either on the adjacent or remote network.

Local

To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker needs to be logged into the operating system on a local machine or a guest operating system.

Physical

The attacker needs to be located near the victim or have physical access to the vulnerable system to exploit the vulnerability. Examples include touching a workstation keyboard or USB device, "shoulder surfing" to see a workstation's display, and touching the screen of a mobile device.

Context-dependent

The type of access needed to exploit the vulnerability is dependent on how the vulnerable product is used. This is most often used for libraries.

Update Type

Definition

Duplicate

More than one CVE ID has been assigned to a single vulnerability.

Rejection

Vendor rejects the assignment of a particular CVE ID.

Split/Merge

A single CVE Entry should be split into two or more CVE Entries OR Two or more existing CVE Entries should be merged into a single CVE Entry.

Update Description

Update the description in an existing CVE Entry.

Update References

Add, remove, or change a reference for an existing CVE Entry.

Other

Any request related to an existing CVE Entry that does not fall within one of the other categories.

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH 2/5] NetRxPkt: Fix memory corruption on VLAN header

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PATCH 2/5] NetRxPkt: Fix memory corruption on VLAN header stripping |
| **Date**: | Thu, 16 Feb 2017 14:29:33 +0200 |

---

```
This patch fixed a problem that was introduced in commit eb700029.

When net_rx_pkt_attach_iovec() calls eth_strip_vlan()
this can result in pkt->ehdr_buf being overflowed, because
ehdr_buf is only sizeof(struct eth_header) bytes large
but eth_strip_vlan() can write
sizeof(struct eth_header) + sizeof(struct vlan_header)
bytes into it.

Devices affected by this problem: vmxnet3.

Subject: CVE-2017-6058 Qemu: net: vmxnet3: OOB NetRxPkt::ehdr_buf access when
 doing vlan stripping

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VMWARE VMXNET3 NIC device support is
vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while stripping
VLAN header from 'eth_buf' buffer in receiving packets.

A remote user/process could use this issue to crash Qemu process resulting in
DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-02/msg03527.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1423358>

Note:- It requires 'VLANSTRIP' feature to be enabled on the vmxnet3 device.

'CVE-2017-6058' assigned via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.
