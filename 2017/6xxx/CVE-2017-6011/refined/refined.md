```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: An out-of-bounds read leading to a buffer overflow was observed in the "simple_vec" function in the "extract.c" source file.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow, out-of-bounds read.
  - Impact of exploitation: Memory corruption, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
  - Attack vectors:  A crafted ICO or CUR file could trigger the vulnerability when processed by the icotool program.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ICO or CUR file to a user who then processes it with icotool.
