Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-6036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The web server receives a request but doesn't sufficiently verify if the request is sent to the expected destination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - The application fails to validate the destination of a request, allowing an attacker to potentially make requests to internal or external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the SSRF vulnerability could lead to an attacker modifying data on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote and requires user interaction (a user clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to make a request to the vulnerable server. This can be done by tricking a user into clicking a crafted link, visiting a malicious website, or performing actions that trigger the vulnerable functionality. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
