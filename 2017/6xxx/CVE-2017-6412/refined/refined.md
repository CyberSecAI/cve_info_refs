Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-6412:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Sophos Secure Web Appliance does not invalidate pre-login Session IDs after a user successfully logs in. It continues to use the same pre-login Session ID instead of issuing a new one. Additionally, it accepts any Session ID, even those not issued by the appliance itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Session Fixation:** The appliance is vulnerable to session fixation attacks because it doesn't validate if a Session ID was issued by itself, allowing an attacker to fix the Session ID.
*   **Lack of Session Invalidation:** The appliance fails to invalidate pre-login Session IDs upon successful login, reusing the same ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can fix the victim's session ID by sending a crafted POST request containing the attacker's chosen session ID to the Sophos Web Appliance through a malicious website.
*   If the victim logs into the appliance with the attacker's fixed session ID, the attacker can then use this same session ID to hijack the victim's session.
*   If the victim has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the appliance.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a malicious web page that sends a POST request with a fixed session ID to the victim's Sophos Web Appliance.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a victim into visiting the malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not require prior authentication to exploit the session fixation vulnerability.
*   **Hosting a malicious website:** The attacker needs to host a website with the crafted malicious page.
*   **Knowledge of the target's Sophos Web Appliance:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the Sophos Web Appliance to target it.
*   **Same Network (partially mitigated):** The community.sophos.com document notes that the attacker would "have to connect from the same IP address the captured login session was using, so they would need to be actually connected to the same network", though this is not mentioned by Qualys.

**Additional Details (from the Qualys Advisory):**
*   The vulnerability is present in Sophos Secure Web Appliance v4.3.1.1, and potentially older versions.
*   The Session ID can be set via the `STYLE` parameter in a POST request.
*   The advisory includes a proof-of-concept demonstration of the attack.

**Mitigation:**
*   The recommended mitigation is to discard/invalidate pre-login Session IDs immediately after user login and issue a new one.
*   Also check for fixed Session IDs that the application never issued to any user.
