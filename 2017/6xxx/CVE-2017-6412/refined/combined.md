Qualys Security Advisory  QSA-2017-02-28

February  28, 2017

Session Fixation  Vulnerability  in  Sophos Secure Web Appliance

SYNOPSIS:

Sophos Secure  Web Appliance  (Hardware  and/or  Virtual)  v4.3.1.1 does not  invalidate  pre-login  Session  IDs
and accepts any  random  Session  IDs provided  by users/attackers  which  allows  sessions  to be fixed.

Reference:- https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/secure-web-gateway.aspx

CVE:  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6412

VULNERABILITY  DETAILS:

Lab  Setup:

1.  Target:   Sophos Web Appliance
2.  Target  IP Address:  192.168.253.147
3.  Site  Hosting  Malicious  Session  Fixation  Page:     http://MaliciousKali.com

Vulnerable/Tested  Version:

Sophos Web Appliance  version 4.3.1.1 is  affected.  Older  versions  may  also  be affected.

Sophos Web Appliance  running  latest  version:

  Vulnerability:  Session Fixation  Vulnerability

An  unauthenticated,  remote  attacker  could  host a malicious  page on his  website  that  makes  POST request  to
the  victim’s  Sophos Web Appliance  to set the  Session  ID using  STYLE  parameter.   The  appliance  does not
validate  if  the  Session  ID sent  by user/browser  was issued  by itself  or fixed  by user/attacker.

Also,  the  appliance  does not  invalidate  pre-login  Session  IDs it  issued  earlier  once user logs  in  successfully.
It continues  to use the same  pre-login  Session  ID instead  of  invalidating  it  and issuing  a new one.

Risk Factor:  High

Impact:

If  victim  visits  a malicious  website  that  sends POST request  with  fixed  Session  ID of attacker’s  choosing  to the
Sophos Web Appliance,  the  victim  ends up logging  in  to the appliance’s  web management  console  with  the
same  Session  ID. An attacker  can then  use same  Session  ID to hijack  victim’s  session  and would  have  full
control  over  the appliance  if  victim  has  administrative  privileges.

CVSS Score:  AV:  N/AC: M/AU: S/C:C/I:  C/A:C

Proof-Of-Concept:

1.  Host a webpage  on malicious  site  that  sends a POST request  with  a fixed  Session  ID in  STYLE

parameter  to the  Sophos Web Appliance.

http://maliciouskali.com/Sophos-Fixation.html

Note: The  Session  ID highlighted  was obtained  as an unauthenticated  user and  I then  changed  its  last
letter  from  a to b

2.  Victim  visits  the  malicious  page  http://maliciouskali.com/Sophos-Fixation.html

Note: For demonstration  purpose,  the malicious  page sets the Session  ID and redirects  victim  to the
appliances  login  page.  However,  a malicious  attacker can  use different  trick.  Also,  note that  the  victim’s
browser  cache was cleared  to make sure  that  the results  are not from  past logins.

3.  Victim  logs  into  the  appliance  with  admin  privileges.

The  same  Session  ID was sent  to the appliance.

4.  Appliance  logs  the  victim  in  with  same  Session  ID that  was fixed  by the  attacker.

5.  An  attacker can use  the same  Session  ID to hijack  victim’s  session.

Potential  Mitigation:

It is recommended  to discard/invalidate  pre-login  Session  IDs as soon  as user  logs  in  and issue  him  a new
Session  ID. Also,  check for  fixed  Session  IDs that  application  never  issued  to any  user.

OWASP  Recommendation:  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Fixation_Protection

24 Mar 2017

This week we started the rollout of another update to the Sophos Web Appliance. Version 4.3.1.2 is an important update that fixes a number of vulnerabilities that were reported to Sophos recently by security researchers Russell Sanford at Critical Start and Kapil Khot of the Qualys Security Research Team. Customers should all receive this update by the middle of next week.

One of the issues describes a way that an attacker could capture and reuse a login session from a valid user. The potential seriousness of this issue was mitigated by the fact that the attacker would have to connect from the same IP address the captured login session was using, so they would need to be actually connected to the same network.

The other issues allowed remote command injection via URL parameters or form fields and required a valid logged-in Administrator session in order to exploit them.

Sophos thanks the researchers for their work and for their help in making our products more secure.

The vulnerabilities were registered at MITRE with the following CVE designations:

* CVE-2017-6184
* CVE-2017-6182
* CVE-2017-6412
* CVE-2017-6183
