{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `IMA::decodeBlockWAVE` function of the audiofile library. This occurs when processing a malformed audio file, specifically with IMA ADPCM compression.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is potential denial of service (DoS) and arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a crafted audio file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted audio file that triggers the overflow when processed by the `audiofile` library."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "Versions 0.2.7, 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.2, 0.3.3, 0.3.4, and 0.3.6 of the `audiofile` library are affected.",
    "fix_information": "The issue is resolved by the commit `a2e9eab8ea87c4ffc494d839ebb4ea145eb9f2e6` which adds a check to ensure `bytesPerBlock` is not greater than `blockAlign` and that `samplesPerBlock % 8` is equal to 1, preventing the overflow.",
     "exploitation": "The vulnerability can be triggered using the `sfconvert` tool by passing a crafted audio file as input with the IMA ADPCM compression, which leads to the overflow in `IMA::decodeBlockWAVE`"
