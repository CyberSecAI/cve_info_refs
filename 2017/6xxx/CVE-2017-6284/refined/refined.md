Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) of the NVIDIA Security Engine.
*   The DRBG does not properly initialize, leading to a weak state of the random number generator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Initialization:** The DRBG is not properly initialized, which can cause predictability of the generated random bits.
*   **Weak Encryption Scheme:**  Sensitive data may be transmitted or stored using a weak encryption scheme due to the DRBG's improper state, rendering the data vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is the potential for information disclosure. The weak encryption and predictability of the DRBG could allow an attacker to uncover sensitive data.
*   Although the CVSS score indicates a high impact on integrity (I:H) this is an error and does not apply to this vulnerability since the information provided states that it is an information disclosure issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some level of access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have low privilege access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable DRBG.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and TX2 devices and NVIDIA SHIELD TV devices.
*   The issue is resolved in Jetson L4T R28.3 and SHIELD TV SE 6.3 respectively.
