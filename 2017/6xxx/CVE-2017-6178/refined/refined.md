  "cve": "CVE-2017-6178",
  "exploit_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a null pointer dereference in the `USBPcap.sys` driver. Specifically, the `IofCallDriver` function is called without properly validating the `DeviceObject` value, leading to a crash when `DeviceObject` is NULL.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Null pointer dereference"
      ],
       "impact": "Local privilege escalation. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local exploit via a crafted device IO control request."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the vulnerable system to trigger the exploit. No prior authentication is needed."
