## Description

[![@bestshow](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5211744?v=4&size=48)](/bestshow)[bestshow](https://github.com/bestshow)opened [on Feb 27, 2017](https://github.com/soruly/trace.moe/issues/8#issue-210563291)

Product：whatanime.ga

Download: <https://github.com/soruly/whatanime.ga>

Vunlerable Version: lastest version and probably prior

Tested Version: lastest version

Author: ADLab of Venustech

Advisory Details:

I have discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in “whatanime.ga”, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in “url” HTTP GET parameter passed to “whatanime.ga-master/index.php” url. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a pop-up messagebox:

Poc:

<http://localhost/.../whatanime.ga-master/index.php?url=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22>
