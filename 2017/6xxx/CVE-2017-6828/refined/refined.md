Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-6828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the `readValue` function within the `FileHandle.cpp` file of the audiofile library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The `readValue` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The heap overflow can cause the program to crash.
- Execution of arbitrary code: In a more advanced scenario, the overflow can be exploited to overwrite critical data or code, leading to arbitrary code execution. The Debian Security Advisory also mentions this as a potential impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing a malformed audio file: The vulnerability is triggered when the `audiofile` library processes a crafted audio file, specifically a WAV file in this instance.
- File parsing: The vulnerable `readValue` function is used in the parsing of the audio file format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious audio file to be processed by the vulnerable application utilizing the audiofile library.
- No special system privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, the user only needs to process the crafted file.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
- The affected version of the audiofile library is 0.3.6.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3814-1) addresses this and other related CVEs in the audiofile library.
- The provided ASan output shows the exact location of the heap overflow, with a write of size 2 bytes occurring outside the allocated region.
- The proof of concept (POC) file is available on the provided github link.
- The vulnerability was reported to the upstream on 2017-01-30.
