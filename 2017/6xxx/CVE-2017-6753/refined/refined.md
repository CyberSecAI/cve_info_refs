Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Cisco WebEx browser extensions for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. It stems from a memory corruption issue (CWE-119) in how the extensions handle certain data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Corruption (CWE-119):** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability within the Cisco WebEx browser extensions. This suggests that the extensions are not properly handling data, leading to potential buffer overflows or other memory-related errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. The code will run with the privileges of the affected browser. This means the attacker could gain control over the user's browser session and potentially access or modify sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely (AV:N).
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must interact with the malicious content (UI:R). This likely involves visiting a malicious website or a website that is hosting malicious code targeting the vulnerable extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have any user credentials on the targeted system. (PR:N)
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network, not needing local access.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince a user to visit a malicious page that leverages the vulnerability in the WebEx extension.
*   **Target Must Be Vulnerable:** The user must have an affected version of the Cisco WebEx browser extension installed on Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox on a Windows system.

**Additional details from the provided text:**
* **Affected products**: Cisco WebEx browser extensions for Windows running on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Specifically versions prior to 1.0.12 for both browsers.
* **CVSS Score:** Base score of 9.6 (Critical).
* **Workarounds**: There are no direct workarounds. The advisory suggests using Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge as those browsers are not affected or removing all WebEx software.
* **Fixed Software**: Updated versions of the browser extensions and WebEx desktop applications address this vulnerability. The advisory also lists specific fixed versions for various WebEx components, including Cisco WebEx Meeting Center, Event Center, Training Center, Support Center, and Meetings Server.
* **Exploit Code Maturity**:  The CVSS score indicates that the exploit code maturity is not defined, however, the report confidence is confirmed.
* **Reported By:** The vulnerability was reported by Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero and Cris Neckar of Divergent Security.
