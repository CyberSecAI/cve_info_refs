Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6635:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal issue in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software. This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths and target files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input related to file paths, allowing an attacker to navigate the file system and target arbitrary files.
- Improper access control: Authenticated users are able to delete files outside of what is intended.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file deletion: A successful exploit allows an attacker to delete any file on the affected system.
- This could lead to system instability, data loss, or denial of service.
- Integrity Impact: The CVSS score indicates a High impact on integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- The attacker sends a crafted request via the web interface, which the software incorrectly processes, resulting in file deletion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authentication: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning software.
- Low privileges are required

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software releases prior to 12.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by rgod, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Cisco has released fixes in version 12.1 and later.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
