Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-6973:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the 'action' parameter within the `adm_config_report.php` page. This parameter is directly used in the HTML output without any encoding or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the susceptibility to XSS attacks. The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser session.
- Session Hijacking: The attacker might steal cookies or session tokens, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.
- Defacement and other malicious actions: The attacker could deface the web page, redirect the user to a malicious site, perform actions on the behalf of the user or perform any other actions which are allowed by Javascript

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URL: The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the 'action' parameter.
- GET/POST request: The vulnerable parameter is accessible via GET and POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Access: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted request to the affected MantisBT instance.
- No special access needed. An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have special permissions to exploit this vulnerability

**Affected Versions:**
- MantisBT versions 1.3.0-rc.2 through 2.2.1 are vulnerable.

**Fixed Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.3.8, 2.1.2, and 2.2.2 (released 2017-03-22), and 2.3.0.

**Mitigation:**
- The fix involves adding a whitelist validation for the `action` parameter. The parameter value is now checked against the constants `MANAGE_CONFIG_ACTION_CREATE`, `MANAGE_CONFIG_ACTION_CLONE`, `MANAGE_CONFIG_ACTION_EDIT`. If the parameter value doesn't match these, a default value (`MANAGE_CONFIG_ACTION_CREATE`) is used
- The fix also involves replacing the hardcoded strings in the code with constants.
