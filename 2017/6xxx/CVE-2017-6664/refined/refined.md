- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected software does not transfer certificate revocation lists (CRLs) across Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) channels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Failure to propagate certificate revocation lists across the Autonomic Control Plane, leading to the acceptance of revoked certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can insert a previously trusted autonomic node into the autonomic domain of an affected system after the node's certificate has been revoked. This can allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Autonomic Networking infrastructure.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can connect an autonomic node with a revoked certificate to the autonomic domain of an affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a node with a previously valid, but now revoked, certificate and must be able to connect to the affected network.
