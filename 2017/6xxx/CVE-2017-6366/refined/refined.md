{
  "Root cause": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in Netgear DGN2200 routers due to missing or insufficient CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "CSRF vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform actions on the router as a logged-in user by tricking the user into visiting a malicious website. When chained with other vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-6334 or CVE-2017-6077, this can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to the router's dnslookup.cgi page. This page is vulnerable to command injection (CVE-2017-6334). The victim needs to be logged in to the router and tricked into visiting the attacker's page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and trick a user logged into the vulnerable router to visit that page. The attacker does not need any prior authentication on the router itself."
