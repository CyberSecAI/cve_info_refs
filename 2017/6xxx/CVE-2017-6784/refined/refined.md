Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6784:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the web interface of Cisco RV340, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability allows for sensitive data to be accessed due to an information disclosure issue in the web interface.
- The weakness is classified as CWE-200, which is Information Exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can access sensitive information.
- This information could then be used to perform further reconnaissance attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- The scope is unchanged (S:U).
- The confidentiality impact is low (C:L), with no impact on integrity or availability (I:N/A:N)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.

**Summary of the provided information:**

The Cisco security advisory details a vulnerability in the web interface of specific Cisco RV series routers that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to access sensitive information. This could lead to further reconnaissance attempts by the attacker. There are no workarounds available, and the advisory points users to consult the associated Cisco bug ID for fixed software releases. The advisory also includes the CVSS score and vector string which reflects a network based attack with low confidentiality impact.
