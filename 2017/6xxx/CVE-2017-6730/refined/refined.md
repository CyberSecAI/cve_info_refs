Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a processing error in how Cisco WAAS Central Manager applies role-based access control (RBAC) to URLs. Specifically, the software fails to properly restrict access to report download URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is a flaw in RBAC implementation, which allows unauthenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows retrieval of completed reports, which may contain sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download completed reports previously scheduled by a WAAS administrator. This unauthorized access to reports could lead to the exposure of potentially sensitive data contained within those reports.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is conducted remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request with a guessed or brute-forced report ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs knowledge of the system's network accessibility.
* **Report ID Knowledge:** The attacker must either know or be able to guess or brute-force a valid report ID of a completed report.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this issue.
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco WAAS products configured with the Central Manager role.
*   The provided CVSS score is 5.3 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
*   The vulnerability is identified by Cisco Bug ID CSCvd87574.
