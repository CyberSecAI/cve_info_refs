Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data passed through the `errorMsg` HTTP GET parameter in the `error.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before including it in the HTML output. Specifically, it's a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the page, which is then executed within the user's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `errorMsg` parameter in the URL is the attack vector, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code by crafting a specific URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- **Victim Interaction:**  The attacker needs a user to click on the crafted link, which may be sent through social engineering, email, or other means.
