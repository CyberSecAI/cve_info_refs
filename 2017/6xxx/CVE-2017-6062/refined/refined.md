Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `OIDCUnAuthAction pass` directive in `mod_auth_openidc`. When this directive is used on a protected path and a user is not authenticated, the module fails to properly scrub HTTP headers. This allows a malicious actor to inject `OIDC_CLAIM_` and `OIDCAuthNHeader` headers that downstream applications would interpret as legitimate authentication data, even when no real authentication has occurred.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Header Scrubbing:** The core issue is that mod_auth_openidc doesn't remove or sanitize user-supplied headers when `OIDCUnAuthAction pass` is enabled, which should be used when no auth is required for a specific location/path.
- **Header Injection:**  Malicious users can inject arbitrary headers, specifically those prefixed with `OIDC_CLAIM_` and `OIDCAuthNHeader`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass Authentication:** By injecting manipulated headers, an attacker can potentially bypass authentication mechanisms in applications that rely on mod_auth_openidc to provide authentication data.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This vulnerability could grant attackers unauthorized access to resources that should be protected.
- **Data Manipulation:** If applications trust these injected headers for authorization or data handling, attackers might be able to manipulate data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate HTTP headers within a request to a vulnerable path.
- **Direct Access:** This vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who can send HTTP requests to the affected web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Paths:** The attacker must know of paths protected with `OIDCUnAuthAction pass`.
- **Understanding of Headers:** The attacker needs an understanding of how mod_auth_openidc propagates header variables.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring that all headers related to mod_auth_openidc are scrubbed/removed when using `OIDCUnAuthAction pass`.
- The affected versions are those before the fix included in version 2.1.5.
- This vulnerability is specifically related to a misconfiguration with `OIDCUnAuthAction pass` and `AuthType openid-connect`
