Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-6080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing HTTP Access-Control header restrictions in the Zammad application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Access Control Headers:** The lack of proper restrictions on HTTP Access-Control headers allows cross-domain requests to be sent and their results to be received via JavaScript. This bypasses same-origin policy, which is designed to isolate web content from different sources, and thus preventing cross-site request forgery and data theft.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized API Access:** Attackers can send cross-domain requests and receive results via JavaScript, gaining access to the entire Zammad REST API using the privileges of the user under attack. This could allow attackers to read, modify, or delete data, depending on the permissions of the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Domain Requests:** Attackers can craft malicious websites or inject malicious scripts into trusted websites that, when visited by a logged-in Zammad user, send cross-domain requests to the Zammad server.
*   **JavaScript Exploitation:** The vulnerability relies on JavaScript execution within the user's browser to send these cross-domain requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to be able to make the victim's browser send requests to the Zammad instance. This could be done through a malicious website, or by injecting a script into a website the victim visits.
*   **User Session Requirement:** The attacker needs a user who has an active, valid session with the Zammad application. This means the victim must be logged into Zammad in their browser when the attack is executed.
