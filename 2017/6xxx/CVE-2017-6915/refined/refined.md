Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in several features of the BigTree CMS application. Specifically, the application does not implement proper CSRF tokens or sufficiently validate the "Referrer" header in certain functionalities. While the application relies on the "Referrer" header for some features, it's not consistently applied across all critical functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks in the following areas:
    -   **User Deletion:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete a registered user.
    -   **Colophon Information Change:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to change the website footer information (Colophon).
    -   **Navigation Social Change:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to change the social media links on the website sidebar to malicious URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Deletion:** An attacker could delete user accounts, potentially locking out legitimate users and disrupting access to the website.
- **Colophon Information Change:** An attacker could deface the website by changing the footer information, potentially injecting malicious content.
- **Navigation Social Change:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious sites through modified social media links, leading to phishing or malware attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting malicious web pages or links that, when visited by an authenticated user, trigger requests to the vulnerable BigTree CMS instance to perform the unauthorized actions.
- Since the application lacks CSRF protection for the listed features, an attacker can create a specially crafted request that exploits the authenticated user's session and make the server perform actions like user deletion or content modification without their knowledge or consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user (typically an administrator) into visiting a malicious page or clicking a link. This could be achieved through methods like:
  - Embedding malicious iframes or images in attacker-controlled websites.
  - Sending phishing emails or messages with links leading to a page that generates the exploit.
- The user must be logged into their BigTree CMS instance for the exploit to succeed.

**Additional Information:**
- The report mentions that the application relies on the "Referrer" header as a form of defense in some features but this protection is not present in the vulnerable components.
- The vulnerability affects versions 4.1.18 and 4.2.16.
- Proof of Concepts (PoCs) were created and are available in a PDF document and via email for the vendor. These include videos and scripts demonstrating the exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
- The issue was reported on March 14, 2017 and the issue was labeled as a "bug" and assigned to milestone 4.2.17.
