Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-6104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload in the `images.php` file of the "Zen App Mobile Native" WordPress plugin. This file does not implement authentication or authorization checks to verify if a user is permitted to upload files. Additionally, it lacks proper sanitization of uploaded files, allowing the upload of executable code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload files without any authentication or authorization.
*   **Lack of File Sanitization:** The plugin does not validate the content of the uploaded files. This allows an attacker to upload malicious files, including PHP scripts.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The vulnerable script does not check if the user is authorized to upload files, making it accessible to anyone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server. This can lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the WordPress site.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
    *   Website defacement.
    *   Installation of backdoors and other malware.
    *   Potential for further attacks on the server and network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker uploads a file via an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `images.php` script. The `file` parameter in the POST request is used to submit the malicious file.
*   **Direct Access to Vulnerable Script:** The `images.php` file is directly accessible without any authentication checks, which makes it vulnerable to remote file uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any valid credentials or account on the WordPress site. The vulnerability exists because of missing authorization checks in the `images.php` script.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `images.php` script.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to use `curl` to upload a PHP file to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The exploit script provided uses `requests` library in python to automate the file upload and verify successful exploitation by executing the `whoami` command and printing out the webserver user.
*   The plugin was closed on October 25, 2016 and is no longer available for download from the official wordpress plugin directory.
