Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6193:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `apngdis` tool when processing APNG files.
- It occurs due to insufficient validation of the image width and height values read from the IHDR chunk of the APNG file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The program reads the width and height values from the IHDR chunk. It uses these values without proper validation. When these values are maliciously set to excessively large numbers, it leads to a heap buffer overflow when the `memcpy` function is called within the `compose_frame` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. The overflow causes a crash of the `apngdis` program due to memory corruption and segmentation fault.
- **Potential for Code Execution:**  While the provided information focuses on a DoS, the heap overflow could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided materials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted APNG File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted APNG file where the width and height fields within the IHDR chunk are set to large values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious APNG file to the vulnerable `apngdis` application. This could be through user interaction, such as opening a malicious file.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The vulnerable code reads the width (`w`) and height (`h`) from the IHDR chunk using `png_get_uint_32`.
2.  It performs a check: `if (w > cMaxPNGSize || h > cMaxPNGSize)` to verify that `w` and `h` are less than a max value (`cMaxPNGSize = 1000000`).
3.  If the check is passed, the `compose_frame` function is called: `compose_frame(frameCur.rows, frameRaw.rows, bop, x0, y0, w0, h0);`
4.  Inside `compose_frame`, a `memcpy` is called with `w` multiplied by 4 as the size parameter:  `memcpy(dp, sp, w*4);`
5.  Due to the large, unvalidated `w` and `h` values in the crafted APNG file, `memcpy` copies a large number of bytes, causing the heap buffer overflow which leads to the application crash.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit examples use width and height values such as 0xf0000 (983040) to trigger the overflow which are less than `cMaxPNGSize` but still large enough to cause memory corruption.
- The vulnerability is present in `apngdis` version 2.8.
- The provided valgrind outputs clearly show the invalid read and write errors during the memcpy operation.
- The exploit has been tested on Linux Debian and Windows 7.

In summary, CVE-2017-6193 is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability caused by a lack of proper validation of the width and height fields in the IHDR chunk of an APNG file, leading to a denial of service.
