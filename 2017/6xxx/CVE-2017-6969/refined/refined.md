Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-6969:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `find_section_in_set` function within `readelf.c`. This function iterates through a set of section indices. The vulnerability arises due to a missing check for invalid section indices or an incorrectly formed set of indices that may lead to out-of-bounds memory access.
- Specifically, the vulnerability was initially due to the lack of a test for invalid section indices. A later fix introduced an additional vulnerability in the while loop condition at line 678: `while ((i = *set++) > 0)`, where the `set++` operation could read beyond the allocated memory when parsing corrupted binaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The primary vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `find_section_in_set` function, leading to an invalid read of size 4 bytes. The `while` loop condition at line 678 in `readelf.c` causes the out-of-bounds read by incrementing a pointer past the end of allocated memory.
- Invalid memory access: The initial reports show that the program tries to read from freed memory.
- Integer overflow: While not explicitly stated, an integer overflow in the section indices could lead to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash (segfault) of the `readelf` utility. This can cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted binary files: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted binary file as input to the `readelf` utility. The crafted binary contains incorrect section indices that will cause the out-of-bounds read in the `find_section_in_set` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious binary file to the `readelf` utility either through a local or remote method.

**Additional details:**
- The bug was initially reported via a fuzzer, and the initial patch for the vulnerability was not complete.
- The issue was resolved through multiple patches, addressing the initial invalid read issue and then a heap-buffer-overflow in the while loop condition.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `binutils` prior to 2.28.1.
