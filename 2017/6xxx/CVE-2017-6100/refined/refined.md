Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way TCPDF handled file paths, specifically within the `fopen()` function. The lack of proper sanitization or validation of input parameters allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs (like `ftp://`) into file paths.  This allowed for the exfiltration of local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is an LFI vulnerability. By manipulating the file path parameter used in `fopen()`, an attacker could force TCPDF to access and process arbitrary local files.
- **Unrestricted URL Scheme:** The code did not restrict the URL schemes that could be used, allowing attackers to specify potentially malicious protocols like `ftp://`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:**  The most significant impact was the ability to exfiltrate local files from the server by using the `ftp://` scheme. An attacker could effectively read server files they shouldn't have access to and send them to an external server under their control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Parameter Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting a malicious URL (e.g., `ftp://attacker-controlled-server/path/to/file`) into a parameter that is later used in a `fopen()` call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence a parameter that is eventually used as a file path by the `fopen()` function within TCPDF.
- The attacker would need a network connection to receive the exfiltrated data when using the `ftp://` vector.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a private bug on Sourceforge (bug #1005).
- The fix involved replacing direct calls to `fopen()` with `TCPDF_STATIC::fopenLocal()`, which ensures the use of a `file://` URL or adds the prefix if it's missing.
- The fix also involved disabling TCPDF calls within HTML by default (`K_TCPDF_CALLS_IN_HTML`), to block the attack vector.
- This issue was addressed in tcpdf version 6.2.0.
- The vulnerability affects versions of TCPDF prior to 6.2.0 and was also fixed in the Debian package version `6.0.093+dfsg-1+deb8u1`.
