## Description

[![@bestshow](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5211744?v=4&size=48)](/bestshow)[bestshow](https://github.com/bestshow)opened [on Feb 28, 2017](https://github.com/Ysurac/FlightAirMap/issues/275#issue-210819899)

Product：FlightAirMap

Download: <https://github.com/Ysurac/FlightAirMap>

Vunlerable Version: v1.0-beta.10 and probably prior

Tested Version: 1v1.0-beta.10

Author: ADLab of Venustech

Advisory Details:

I have discovered multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in “FlightAirMap”, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in multiple HTTP POST parameters passed to several pages. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation examples below use the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a pop-up messagebox:
