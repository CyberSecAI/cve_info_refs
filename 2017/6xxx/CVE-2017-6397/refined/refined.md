- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in multiple HTTP POST parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted URLs with embedded JavaScript code injected into various HTTP GET parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and entice a user to click on them. The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the server.
