  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2017-6532",
    "description": "The Televes COAXDATA GATEWAY 1Gbps device (Ref: 769301) has a vulnerability related to privilege escalation. The device has two main users, Admin for web/ssh management and a restricted user (username) with basic web access. It was discovered that the restricted user can obtain or modify the administrator password, gaining access to all device credentials and the root shell of the BusyBox operating system.",
    "root_cause": "The device stores credentials in cleartext in the configuration file and there are insufficient access controls allowing a low privileged user to access the backup file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext storage of credentials",
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
       "Weak session mechanism",
       "Credentials sent via GET"
    ],
    "impact": "A low-privileged user can gain administrative access and full control over the device, potentially affecting other devices on the internal network.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing the backup file containing credentials through a specific URL",
      "Modifying the administrator password through the password change form",
      "Restoring a malicious backup configuration",
      "Credentials captured in browser history",
      "Session hijacking due to ip based session management"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires access to the device's web interface as a low-privileged user."
