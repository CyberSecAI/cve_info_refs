SSA-275839: Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in Industrial Products

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 6.5

2017-05-08
2019-10-08
V2.2

SUMMARY

Several industrial products are affected by a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a Denial-
of-Service condition via PROFINET DCP network packets under certain circumstances. Precondition for
this scenario is a direct Layer 2 access to the affected products.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, is working on updates for the remaining
affected products and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures until ﬁxes are available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

On a single host the affected component is shared among the affected products. Installing one ﬁxed
version will mitigate the vulnerability for all Siemens applications installed on the single host.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.
