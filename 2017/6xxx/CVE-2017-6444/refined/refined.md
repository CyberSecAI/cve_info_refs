  "extracted_information": {
    "root_cause": "The MikroTik Router lacks a protection mechanism against fast network connections, allowing attackers to cause a denial of service.",

      "Lack of protection against rapid network traffic.",
      "ARP table overflow (inferred from the exploit title)"
    ],
