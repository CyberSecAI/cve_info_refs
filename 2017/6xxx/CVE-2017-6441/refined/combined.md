### @sgolemon **[sgolemon](/sgolemon)** commented [Feb 22, 2017](#issue-209596605)

Using a non-literal expression in a declare value can cause the

compiler to crash trying to turn that AST node into a usable zval.

There was an existing test for such values using 'encoding',

but that didn't crash because it's handled by the lexer

rather than being compiled.

Trying to use a non-literal with ticks reproduces the crash.

Sorry, something went wrong.
