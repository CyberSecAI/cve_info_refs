Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-6303:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided content directly mentions CVE-2017-6303 in the context of multiple vulnerabilities found in ytnef library. Specifically, it's listed as one of the CVEs fixed in version 1.9.1, along with a description of the vulnerabilities. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause for CVE-2017-6303 is an "Invalid Write and Integer Overflow" which leads to a vulnerability due to missing checks and improper handling of data within the `ytnef` library. This is part of a series of issues stemming from unchecked allocations, missing boundary checks and lack of proper error handling in the code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Integer Overflow:**  Integer overflow vulnerability when handling certain data lengths, potentially leading to incorrect memory calculations or other issues.
    *   **Invalid Write:** The integer overflow would lead to an invalid write, potentially writing outside the intended memory bounds. This is combined with another integer overflow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a heap overflow which can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted winmail.dat file. This indicates an attack vector via file input, likely through email attachments or other file handling mechanisms.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious winmail.dat file using a vulnerable version of ytnef. This could be achieved through social engineering, email attachments, or other file delivery methods. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious `winmail.dat` file to trigger the specific integer overflow and invalid write.

**3. Technical Details from Code Snippets:**
* **Missing Size Check:** The provided code diff demonstrates the absence of a size check before copying data into a buffer. This missing check allows for the possibility of out-of-bounds write, which is a component of the vulnerability in CVE-2017-6303. The patch includes the following `SIZECHECK` macro:
  ```c
  #define SIZECHECK(x) { if ((((char *)d - (char *)data) + x) >= size) {  printf("Corrupted file\n"); exit(-1); } }
  ```
  This is applied before memory copy operations.
*   **Integer Overflow Prevention** The diff shows an attempt to avoid an integer overflow.

**4. Additional Information:**
*   The advisory from X41 D-Sec indicates that the vendor was responsive and released a patch (version 1.9.1) which fixes this and other issues.
*   The provided data also shows that this vulnerability was tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla as part of a larger set of issues, and subsequently addressed by a patch.
*   The vulnerability was also addressed in Debian through a security update for `libytnef`.
*   The GitHub commit log shows the patch as part of a larger set of security fixes to the library.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-6303 is caused by an integer overflow combined with an invalid write, within the `ytnef` library. This vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted winmail.dat file and could lead to denial of service, memory corruption, and possibly arbitrary code execution if exploited successfully. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.9.1 of `ytnef`.
