Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the AutoVNF tool within the Cisco Ultra Services Framework. This flaw allows unauthorized access to sensitive administrative credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the insecure storage or handling of administrative credentials for Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) and Cisco OpenStack deployments within the AutoVNF tool. This leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain access to administrative credentials. With these credentials, the attacker could potentially gain complete control over the affected Cisco ESC and OpenStack deployments. This can include configuration changes, data theft, and service disruptions. However, the provided CVSS vector only reflects a high impact on confidentiality (C:H) with no impact on integrity (I:N) or availability (A:N)

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not need any prior privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) to exploit the vulnerability. They only require network access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing by Cisco.
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- Fixed versions are available in Cisco Ultra Services Framework Releases 5.0.3 and 5.1.
- There is no known public announcement or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-200, which relates to information disclosure.
