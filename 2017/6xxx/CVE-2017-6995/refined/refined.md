Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6995:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Multiple memory corruption issues. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `AVEVideoEncoder` component of iOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption issues. The specific type of memory corruption isn't specified, but it could be related to buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An application may be able to gain kernel privileges. This would allow a malicious application to execute arbitrary code with the highest level of permissions on the device, leading to complete compromise of the system.
