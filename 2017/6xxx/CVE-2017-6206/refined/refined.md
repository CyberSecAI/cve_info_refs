It includes two python scripts `get-user-info.py` and `user_add.py` which can be used to exploit the vulnerability. \n\n**Vulnerability Details:**\n\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   Unauthenticated Command Bypass: The scripts exploit the lack of authentication on certain endpoints, allowing an attacker to send commands to the switch without proper authorization.\n    *   Unauthenticated Information Disclosure: The script `get-user-info.py` demonstrates the ability to retrieve sensitive user information without needing to authenticate.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:**\n    *   An attacker can add unauthorized users to the switch with administrative privileges via `user_add.py`.\n    *   An attacker can obtain user account information via `get-user-info.py`.\n*  **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   The vulnerabilities are exploited via HTTP requests to specific URLs on the D-Link switch.\n    *  The attack is performed remotely as long as attacker has network access to the device.\n*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable D-Link switch.\n    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the switch.\n\nThe provided scripts demonstrate the ability to:\n\n1.  Retrieve user information from `/DataStore/990_user_account.js`.\n2.  Add a user (admin2 in this case) to the switch through the `/form/User_Accounts_Apply` endpoint.\n\nThese actions are performed without authentication, indicating a significant security flaw.\n"
