{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an unsafe memcpy call in the pmm_handle_incoming_ping() function of the pmmasterd daemon. The size argument for the memcpy is taken directly from untrusted user input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Unvalidated Input"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS), leak process memory, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the pmmasterd process (typically root).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted request with action code ACT_ALERT_EVENT to the pmserviced/pmmasterd daemon on port 12345"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to port 12345 of the target system. Also, the attacker must be able to bind a privileged port (<= 1024), typically requiring root privileges on the attacker's machine.",
        "affected_versions": "Quest Privilege Manager <= 6.0.0-50"
