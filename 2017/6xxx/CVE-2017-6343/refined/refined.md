Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6343:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided text does not detail the root cause of the vulnerability, but does mention it is related to a Dahua NVR, and is one of three CVEs identified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Based on the surrounding text, this vulnerability appears to be related to a Dahua NVR. The blog post mentions "Multiple Exposures" which suggest the vulnerability is likely related to an exposure of sensitive information or a lack of proper access controls. This is also supported by the fact that the public disclosure was delayed by request from Dahua until all issues are resolved.

**Impact of exploitation:** The text doesn't explicitly state the impact of exploitation, but the implication of "Multiple Exposures" suggests possible compromise of the NVR, such as exposure of video data, or the ability to control the device.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector isn't specified. However, given that it's a network video recorder (NVR), it's likely that the vulnerability is accessible via a network connection. The blog post also states, "Sent to both the Australian Importer and Dahua, everything mentioned here plus more." This implies there were likely multiple attack vectors identified, however the specifics are not mentioned.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The specific attacker capabilities are not explicitly mentioned, however given this is likely a network-accessible vulnerability, access to the same network as the NVR would likely be required.
