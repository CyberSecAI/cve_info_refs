Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-6199:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient email address validation in Sandstorm's user authentication process. The system incorrectly parsed comma-separated email addresses, allowing an attacker to include a legitimate email address followed by a fake email address with a desired domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The system did not properly validate email addresses, specifically failing to reject comma-separated lists.
*   **Logical Flaw in Domain Membership Check:** The system determined domain membership by checking if the string after the "@" in an email address matched a whitelist, without properly sanitizing the input.
*   **Reliance on Nodemailer Behavior:** The system incorrectly assumed that Nodemailer would fail to send emails to invalid addresses, not anticipating that Nodemailer would interpret comma-separated lists as multiple addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Authorization:** Attackers could bypass the intended authorization scheme, gaining membership to a specific organization/domain they don't belong to.
*   **Access to Restricted Resources:** By gaining unauthorized access, attackers could install apps, create grains, and potentially discover identities of other organization members.
*   **Resource Consumption:** Attackers could install malicious apps, leading to resource exhaustion (CPU, RAM, disk) on the server.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The authorization bypass could be combined with other vulnerabilities to escalate the attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Page:** The attacker would enter a specially crafted email address (e.g., `attacker@evil.com,fake@targetdomain.com`) into the login field.
*   **Email Delivery:** The system would send a login email with a random password to both addresses in the crafted input.
*   **Access:** The attacker would use the received random password to gain access to the service as if they were a member of the target domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Sandstorm Login:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Sandstorm login page.
*   **Ability to Receive Email:** The attacker needs access to the mailbox for their real email address to retrieve the password.
*   **Target Domain Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the email domain to which they wish to gain unauthorized membership.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Sandstorm versions prior to the fix.
*   The vulnerability is considered a moderate severity if the server is configured with an organization defined by email domain.
*   The fix implemented stricter email address validation that disallows separator characters and multiple "@" signs.
