Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6878

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when processing user-supplied data, specifically in the `name_2` parameter within the `delete.php` script. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to store malicious JavaScript code within the application's database or file system. This code is then executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `delete.php` with a malicious payload injected into the `name_2` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to be logged into the MetInfo administrator panel to inject the malicious JavaScript code.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests: The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the server

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability:
- The attacker injects the JavaScript payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(2)>` into the `name_2` parameter.
- When the affected page is accessed, the injected JavaScript is executed.

**Affected Software:**
- MetInfo version 5.3.15

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `delete.php` file, which suggests a problem with how the application handles input during a delete operation.
- The payload used in the PoC demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript, which can have serious consequences for website visitors and users.
- The attacker needs to have administrator access to inject the payload, but the impact affects anyone visiting the website.
- The provided PoC shows that the vulnerable parameter is `name_2` in the delete.php, and that the JavaScript is executed when the page is accessed, either by the admin or by a normal user in the frontend.
