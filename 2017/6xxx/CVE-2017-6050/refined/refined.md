Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-6050:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `CDatabaseGroupManager::GetReport()` function within the `igmgr.dll` file of Ecava IntegraXor. The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input in the `report` parameter of a `getdata` request before constructing a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application in the form of SQL queries. This is more severe than just a data breach, as it allows complete control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTP requests to the web interface of IntegraXor. Specifically, it can be triggered by sending a crafted request to a `getdata` endpoint (e.g. `/MyProj/getdata`) with a malicious payload in the `report` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated remote access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable IntegraXor application, typically through HTTP.
- **Knowledge of endpoint:** The attacker needs to know a valid endpoint such as `/MyProj/getdata` to send the malicious request.

**Additional Details:**
-  The SQL injection may require specific characteristics of the underlying database, such as the ability to use `index` as a column alias or support for batched queries.
-  Tenable identified PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB as databases that meet these requirements and were tested. Other databases could be vulnerable but were not tested.
- The provided cURL request in the Tenable advisory demonstrates a successful exploit that executes a `dir` command on the remote host.
