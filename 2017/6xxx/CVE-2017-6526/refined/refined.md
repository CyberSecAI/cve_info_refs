Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-6526:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The dnaLIMS application includes a web shell (`sysAdmin.cgi`) that is intended to be accessed only by authenticated users. However, the authentication check can be bypassed by sending a POST request to this page, effectively allowing unauthenticated access to the web shell.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass: The application fails to properly validate user authentication for the `sysAdmin.cgi` web shell when a POST request is used. Specifically, the application does not validate the UID parameter within the POST request, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication controls.
- Improperly Protected Web Shell: The web shell is exposed and accessible without proper authentication measures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote command execution: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute system commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user.
- Full System Control: By exploiting the web shell, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the server and the dnaLIMS software.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to `cgi-bin/dna/sysAdmin.cgi`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable web shell on the server. This implies a network connection to the server hosting the web application, either locally or remotely over the internet.
- No prior authentication or specific knowledge about the server is needed.
- The attacker does not need to know user credentials to exploit this flaw.
