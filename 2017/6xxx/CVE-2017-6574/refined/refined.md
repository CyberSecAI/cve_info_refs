The provided content describes multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the Mail-Masta 1.0 WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the direct use of user-supplied input within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities across several PHP files within the plugin.
- The plugin uses direct string concatenation or unsanitized GET/POST parameters in SQL queries
- Unauthenticated SQL injection on `csvexport.php`
- Authenticated SQL injections in `view-list.php`, `count_of_send.php`, `campaign_save.php`, `view-campaign-list.php`, `view-campaign.php`, `add_member.php`, `edit-list.php`, `edit_member.php`, `campaign-delete.php` and `subscriber_list.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database
- Attackers can potentially modify or delete data
- Attackers may gain unauthorized access to other parts of the application or the underlying system through SQL injection

**Attack vectors:**
- Unsanitized GET parameters (`list_id`, `filter_list`, `id` )
- Unsanitized POST parameters (`camp_id`, `list_id`, `subscriber_email`)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For `csvexport.php` no authentication is required.
- For the other vulnerable files, administrative access to the WordPress site is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable files and manipulate the GET or POST parameters.
