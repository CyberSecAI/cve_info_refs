{
  "CVE-2017-6214": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of packets with the URG flag. Applications using the splice() and tcp_splice_read() functionality can allow a remote attacker to force the kernel to enter a condition in which it can loop indefinitely.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `tcp_splice_read()` function, specifically when it encounters a TCP packet with the URG flag and stores this packet in the receive queue. If `__tcp_splice_read()` returns zero and a problematic skb remains in the queue, `sk_wait_data()` will return immediately, creating an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of TCP packets with URG flags",
       "Infinite loop vulnerability in `tcp_splice_read()`"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering an infinite loop in the kernel using splice() and tcp_splice_read() functions, causing CPU exhaustion and soft lockups.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted TCP packets with the URG flag to a system using the splice() and tcp_splice_read() functionality."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A remote attacker with the ability to send specially crafted TCP packets with the URG flag."
