- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in two HTTP GET parameters passed to the `benchmarks/delta.php` URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious URLs with payloads in the `benchmark` or `time` parameters of `benchmarks/delta.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send or trick a user into clicking the crafted URL.
