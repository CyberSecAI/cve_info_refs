Webpagetest – Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in “benchmarks/delta.php”

Product: webpagetest

Download: <https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest>

Vunlerable Version: 3.0 and probably prior

Tested Version: 3.0

Author: ADLab of Venustech

Advisory Details:

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in“webpagetest 3.0”, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in two HTTP GET parameters passed to the “webpagetest-master/www/benchmarks/delta.php” URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation examples below use the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a pop-up messagebox:
