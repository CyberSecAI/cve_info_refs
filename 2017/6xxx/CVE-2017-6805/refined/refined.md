Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a path traversal issue in the TFTP server implementation within MobaXterm Personal Edition v9.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The TFTP server does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied file paths in TFTP read requests. This allows attackers to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files and directories outside of the intended TFTP server root directory.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to adequately sanitize the file path received in the TFTP request.
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote File Disclosure:** Attackers can remotely read sensitive files from the victim's system that the TFTP server process has access to, such as configuration files, system files, or user data.
- The example provided shows how an attacker can read the `Windows/system.ini` file.
**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely via a UDP connection to the TFTP server's port 69.
- **TFTP Read Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted TFTP read request that includes directory traversal sequences (`../`).
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the victim's system where the vulnerable MobaXterm TFTP server is running.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker benefits from knowing the path to a target file, though general system files are often good starting points.
- **Ability to Send UDP Packets:** The attacker must be able to send raw UDP packets to the target system's port 69.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerable application is MobaXterm Personal Edition v9.4.
- The vulnerability is triggered by starting the MobaXterm TFTP server which listens on default TFTP port 69.
- An example python script demonstrating the exploit is provided.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity.
- The vendor was notified but did not reply.
