Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-6277:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. A value passed from a user to the driver is not correctly validated before being used as an index to an array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- Usage of an unvalidated value as an array index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS).
- Potential escalation of privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a crafted input to the `DxgkDdiEscape` function through a user-mode application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system.
- Ability to execute code as a user.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2017-6268 and CVE-2017-6272.
- The vulnerability is present in the `nvlddmkm.sys` driver.
- The provided CVSS vector string: `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C` indicates that it's a locally exploitable vulnerability that can lead to high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability. It also indicates a low attack complexity and no user interaction required.
