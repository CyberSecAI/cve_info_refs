Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The application does not properly neutralize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the integrity of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based (AV:N).
- The attacker needs to have low privileges on the application to perform the attack (PR:L)
- The user needs to be tricked into performing some action, such as clicking a malicious link (UI:R).
- The attack scope is changed to the context of the web application (S:C).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application, likely by exploiting a vulnerability that allows persistent or reflected XSS attacks.
- The attacker also needs some user to interact with that malicious script.
