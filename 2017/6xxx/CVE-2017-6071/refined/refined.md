Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6071

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The CMS Made Simple Form Builder module fails to properly check permissions in the `exportxml` action. This allows unauthenticated users to access the `exportxml` functionality, which can expose sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control on the `exportxml` functionality within the Form Builder module.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows attackers to obtain sensitive form data through the `exportxml` action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve potentially sensitive information such as email addresses and other form properties by accessing the `exportxml` function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a web browser.
- **Direct Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `exportxml` action within the Form Builder module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable CMS Made Simple installation.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Form ID knowledge:** The attacker needs to know or enumerate valid `form_id` values, which can be obtained from the HTML source of a published form or by enumeration.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the following URL with a valid form ID:

```
http://host/index.php?mact=FormBuilder,cntnt01,exportxml,0&cntnt01showtemplate=false&cntnt01form_id=[FORM_ID]
```

The fix involves adding an access control check to the vulnerable file `action.exportxml.php`:

```php
if (! $this->CheckAccess()) exit;
```
This check ensures that only authorized users can access this functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Form Builder module prior to 0.8.1.6.
- The document mentions this is one of three vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-6070, CVE-2017-6071, CVE-2017-6072) related to authorization bypass in the CMS Made Simple Form Builder module.
