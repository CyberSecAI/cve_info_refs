## Details

USN-3625-1 fixed a vulnerability in Perl. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Perl to

hang, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8853](/security/CVE-2015-8853))

working directory. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-6185](/security/CVE-2016-6185))

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled the rmtree and remove\_tree

functions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to set the mode

on arbitrary files. ([CVE-2017-6512](/security/CVE-2017-6512))

GwanYeong Kim discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain data when

using the pack function. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6913](/security/CVE-2018-6913))

# Perl: Race condition vulnerability â GLSA **201709-12**

A vulnerability in module File::Path for Perl allows local
attackers to set arbitrary mode values on arbitrary files bypassing
security restrictions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/perl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.24.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.24.1-r2** |

| Package | **perl-core/File-Path** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.130.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.130.0** |

| Package | **virtual/perl-File-Path** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.130.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.130.0** |

### Background

File::Path module provides a convenient way to create directories of
arbitrary depth and to delete an entire directory subtree from the
filesystem.

### Description

A race condition occurs within concurrent environments. This condition
was discovered by The cPanel Security Team in the rmtree and remove\_tree
functions in the File-Path module before 2.13 for Perl. This is due to
the time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition between the
stat() that decides the inode is a directory and the chmod() that tries
to make it user-rwx.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this condition to set arbitrary mode
values on arbitrary files and hence bypass security restrictions.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Perl users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/perl-5.24.1-r2"

```

All File-Path users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=perl-core/File-Path-2.130.0"

```

All Perl-File-Path users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=virtual/perl-File-Path-2.130.0"

```

    - Add tests to improve coverage ratios as measured by Devel::Cover
    - No functional changes.

2.12_002 2017-03-12
    - GH#41 RT 117019 Fixed File::Path::remove_tree option hash is auto
                      populated and cannot be reused

    - RT 94209  document that the thread safety issue will not change and
      communicate alternative.
    - RT 85878  be more generous with error check regex given we could be
      dealing with a pre-1.25 Carp.

      error checking.
    - GH #34 Skip Windows 2000 and earlier unit tests (test change).

    - Change argument check error from croak to carp since there are some
      dependent modules using non-standard options.  The error check will
      move back to croak when dependent modules have the opportunity to
      correct the argument.

2.10_005 2015-07-17

    - Introduce make_path() and rm_tree() API extension.
    - Remove problematic test revealed by Matt Kraal on QNX
      (see http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/140187)

2.06_04 2008-05-13 14:28:10 UTC
    - Can't use \S+ if a directory name contains a space (which
      it will may do on Windows (the continuing saga of CPAN #35708)).

2.06_03 2008-05-12 20:17:33 UTC
    - ancestor removal test getting slashed up on Windows
      (see CPAN #35708).

2.06_02 2008-05-12 09:53:39 UTC
    - Problem on Windows where c:\path\to\dir was not considered
      to be underneath C:/Path/To (issues of directory separators

      http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/05/msg1435813.html

2.06_01 2008-05-10 20:54:35 UTC
    - Close directory handle in t/Path.t with closedir (close is
      close but incorrect). Problem identified with Strawberry
      Perl.

2.06 2008-05-08 09:27:24 UTC
    - skip counts for ancestor rmpath() tests were wrong
    - fix old/new interface heuristics as per Gisle Aas
      http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2008/05/msg136625.html

2.05 2008-05-07 08:20:20 UTC
    - better diagnosics and less panicking when
      removing an ancestor path. Reported by Alan Ferrency
      and patch suggested by Michael Schilli (#31721).
    - fix typo spotted by Brendan O'Dea (#35623).

2.04 2007-11-22 13:43:34 UTC
    - integrate blead change #32276 (rmtree a file on VMS)
      (see http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.changes/2007/11/msg20108.html)
    - add a test to show that we can rmtree() a file
    - specify core prereqs in Makefile.PL (as per cpants)

2.03 2007-11-04 18:11:51 UTC
    - On 5.8.x, the installation would be shadowed by the core
      files, and thus not be visible. Makefile.PL tweaked
      appropriately to ensure that the installation overwrites
      the core files. Users on 5.6 and below need not upgrade,
      users on 5.8 should. Bug spotted by imacat (#30459).

2.02 2007-10-24 10:05:30 UTC
    - documentation correction fix only: corrected name of module
      File::Find::Rule. Users need not upgrade.

2.01 2007-09-29 10:16:34 UTC
    - the documentation referred to 'skip_others', but the attribute
      is named 'safe'.
    - correctly test VMS behaviour when safe attribute is set.

2.00_11 2007-09-08 12:51:30 UTC
    - depth attribute (for keep_root functiionality) was not
      correctly initialised in both old and new APIs
    - initial chdir() into a child dir would fail on strange
      protection masks (following race condition fix).
    - delete subsequent root paths even if a previous one fails

2.00_10 2007-09-04 17:18:01 UTC
    - Infinite loop fix in _rmtree() for VMS (perl change #31775)

      http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79685

2.00_07 2007-07-09 19:33:52 UTC
    - 2.00_06 upload unfortunately contained blib directories

2.00_06 2007-07-04 21:34:14 UTC
    - Incorporate code changes from blead
    - Skip counts off by one

2.00_05 2007-06-27 21:23:25 UTC
    - Use catfile() instead of catdir() in _mkpath() for VMS,
      patch from Craig Berry.
    - Don't use warnings (my code doesn't have errors anyway),
      code change suggested by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.
    - Don't pass LICENSE key to WriteMakefile in Makefile.PL
      if the installed version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker is not
      sufficiently modern.

1.99_02 2007-05-27 09:25:53 UTC
    - Don't allow a directory named '' (empty string) to be created.
    - File::Spec routines catdir() and updir() interact differently on Win32
    - $! needs to be managed more carefully on Win32

1.99_01 2007-05-17 13:09:59 UTC

# USN-3625-1: Perl vulnerabilities

16 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Perl.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) - Practical Extraction and Report Language

## Details

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Perl to

hang, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-8853](/security/CVE-2015-8853))

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly loaded libraries from the current

working directory. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-6185](/security/CVE-2016-6185))

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled the rmtree and remove\_tree

functions. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to set the mode

on arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu

16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-6512](/security/CVE-2017-6512))

Brian Carpenter discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10.

([CVE-2018-6797](/security/CVE-2018-6797))

Nguyen Duc Manh discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

and Ubuntu 17.10. ([CVE-2018-6798](/security/CVE-2018-6798))

GwanYeong Kim discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain data when

using the pack function. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-6913](/security/CVE-2018-6913))

Package        : perl
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-6512
Debian Bug     : 863870

The cPanel Security Team reported a time of check to time of use
(TOCTTOU) race condition flaw in File::Path, a core module from Perl to
create or remove directory trees. An attacker can take advantage of this
flaw to set the mode on an attacker-chosen file to a attacker-chosen
value.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.20.2-3+deb8u7.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been
fixed in version 5.24.1-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.24.1-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them â but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
