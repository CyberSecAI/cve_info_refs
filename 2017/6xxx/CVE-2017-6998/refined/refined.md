```
Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple memory corruption issues.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory corruption due to improper memory handling within the AVEVideoEncoder component.
Impact of exploitation: An application may be able to gain kernel privileges, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
Attack vectors: Exploitation likely involves crafting malicious data that triggers the memory corruption within the AVEVideoEncoder component. The specific mechanism is not detailed in the provided text, but the vulnerability is triggered by an application.
Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to run a malicious application on the affected device (Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Apple TV).
