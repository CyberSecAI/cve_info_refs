Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-6891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Two errors in the `asn1_find_node()` function within GnuTLS libtasn1.
- Specifically, a stack-based buffer overflow can occur due to insufficient input validation when processing a crafted ASN.1 assignments file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Improper input validation in `asn1_find_node()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) through a crash due to a buffer overflow, as demonstrated by the `asn1Coding` utility crashing.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, though not explicitly proven in the provided materials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted ASN.1 assignments file.
- User interaction is required to process the crafted file, for example using the `asn1Coding` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious ASN.1 assignments file.
- Ability to trick a user to process this crafted file using a vulnerable application like `asn1Coding`.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- **Secunia Research Discovery**: The vulnerability was discovered by Jakub Jirasek of Secunia Research.
- **Upstream Fix**: The upstream fix involves changes to `asn1_find_node()` and the introduction of new test cases, as can be seen on the linked git commits.
- **SUSE Severity**: SUSE initially rated the vulnerability as "moderate" with a CVSS v2 base score of 3.3 (local exploit) and a CVSS v3 base score of 5.1(local exploit).
- **Debian Fix**: Debian fixed the issue in version 4.2-3+deb8u3 of the `libtasn1-6` package.
- **Gentoo Fix:** Gentoo addressed the vulnerability by upgrading the package to version >= `4.12-r1`.
- **openSUSE Fix**: OpenSUSE fixed the vulnerability in version `4.9-6.1` of `libtasn1` package.
- **Test Cases:** The provided files `foo.tmp` and `invalid-assignments2.txt` represent test cases that cause a crash.
- **Patch Application:** The updated packages for several products are provided in the SUSE information section.
- **GnuTLS relation**: GnuTLS is related since the vulnerable function comes from libtasn1 which is a dependency of it.
