  "CVE-2017-6463": {
    "description": "A vulnerability found in the NTP server allows an authenticated remote attacker to crash the daemon by sending an invalid setting via the `:config` directive. The `unpeer` option expects a number or an address as an argument. In case the value is `0`, a segmentation fault occurs.",
    "root_cause": "The ntpd service crashes due to an invalid value being passed to the `unpeer` option through the :config directive.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of the `unpeer` option in the `:config` directive",
      "Lack of error handling when processing the unpeer option."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS).  A successful exploit causes the ntpd service to crash, disrupting time synchronization for affected systems.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted message with the :config directive and an invalid value for the unpeer option to the NTP server."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Authenticated remote access to the ntpd service."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `unpeer` option receives the value of `0`. A segmentation fault occurs, causing the service to crash. The vulnerability was discovered by Cure53, and it affects all NTP versions up to, but not including, 4.2.8p10, and ntp-4.3.0 up to, but not including ntp-4.3.94."
