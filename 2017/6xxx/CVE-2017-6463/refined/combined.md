RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1442083#c0)  Miroslav Lichvar    2017-04-13 13:24:25 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When the FIPS mode was enabled and hostnames specified in ntp.conf couldn't be resolved on start, the resolving process of ntpd is not be able to configure the main process later and it won't be using the servers for synchronization.  The problem is that ntpd uses a random MD5 key when no request key was specified in the config and MD5 is not allowed in the FIPS mode.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): ntp-4.2.6p5-25.el7_3.1.x86_64  How reproducible: Most of the time  Steps to Reproduce: 1. enable FIPS mode 2. disable chronyd service, enable ntpd service 3. reboot  Actual results: The "ntpq -pn" command reports that no NTP servers are used and the system log contains an "ntpd_intres[729]: MAC encrypt: digest init failed" error message.  Expected results: ntpq -pn lists all servers specified in ntp.conf.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1442083#c1)  Miroslav Lichvar    2017-04-13 13:54:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1271436](attachment.cgi?id=1271436&action=diff "Use SHA1 request key by default to fix delayed name resolving in FIPS mode") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1271436&action=edit "Use SHA1 request key by default to fix delayed name resolving in FIPS mode") Use SHA1 request key by default to fix delayed name resolving in FIPS mode  With this patch ntpd will use by default a random SHA1 key instead of an MD5 key, which is still allowed in the FIPS mode.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1442083#c5)  Andrej Dzilský    2017-10-17 15:15:36 UTC  ``` Verified.

#### Description

A vulnerability found in the NTP server allows an authenticated remote attacker to crash the daemon by sending an invalid setting via the `:config` directive. The `unpeer` option expects a number or an address as an argument. In case the value is `0`, a segmentation fault occurs.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page).
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p10 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances, and auto-restart `ntpd` (without `-g`) if it stops running.

---

#### Credit

This weakness was discovered by Cure53.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

FreeBSD-SA-17:03.ntp Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities of ntp
Category: contrib
Module: ntp
Announced: 2017-04-12
Credits: Network Time Foundation
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2017-03-28 04:48:17 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE)
2017-04-12 06:24:35 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p9)
2017-03-28 04:48:55 UTC (stable/10, 10.3-STABLE)
2017-04-12 06:24:35 UTC (releng/10.3, 10.3-RELEASE-p18)
CVE Name: CVE-2017-6464, CVE-2017-6462, CVE-2017-6463, CVE-2016-9042
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
A vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server's parsing of configuration
directives. [CVE-2017-6464]
A vulnerability was found in NTP, in the parsing of packets from the
DPTS Clock. [CVE-2017-6462]
A vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server's parsing of configuration
directives. [CVE-2017-6463]
A vulnerability was found in NTP, affecting the origin timestamp check
function. [CVE-2016-9042]
III. Impact
A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a
crafted message. [CVE-2017-6463, CVE-2017-6464]
A malicious device could send crafted messages, causing ntpd to crash.
[CVE-2017-6462]
An attacker able to spoof messages from all of the configured peers
could send crafted packets to ntpd, causing later replies from those
peers to be discarded, resulting in denial of service. [CVE-2016-9042]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce the risk associated with these attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:03/ntp-11.0.patch.xz
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:03/ntp-11.0.patch.xz.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-11.0.patch.xz.asc
[FreeBSD 10.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:03/ntp-10.3.patch.xz
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:03/ntp-10.3.patch.xz.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.3.patch.xz.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [ntp](/security/cves?package=ntp) - Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs

## Details

USN-3707-1 and USN-3349-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in NTP. This update

provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed

addresses when performing rate limiting. A remote attacker could possibly

use this issue to perform a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-7426](/security/CVE-2016-7426))

Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain crafted

broadcast mode packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

perform a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-7427](/security/CVE-2016-7427), [CVE-2016-7428](/security/CVE-2016-7428))

Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain control

mode packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to set or unset traps.

([CVE-2016-9310](/security/CVE-2016-9310))

Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly handled the trap service.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting

in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-9311](/security/CVE-2016-9311))

It was discovered that the NTP legacy DPTS refclock driver incorrectly handled

the /dev/datum device. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-6462](/security/CVE-2017-6462))

It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain invalid settings in a

:config directive. A remote authenticated user could possibly use this issue

to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-6463](/security/CVE-2017-6463))

Michael Macnair discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain responses.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-7183](/security/CVE-2018-7183))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain

zero-origin timestamps. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-7185](/security/CVE-2018-7185))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ntp)
  -
  [1:4.2.6.p3+dfsg-1ubuntu3.12](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ntp/1%3A4.2.6.p3%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu3.12)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1433995#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-20 14:01:26 UTC  ``` There is a potential for a buffer overflow in the legacy Datum Programmable Time Server refclock driver.  Here the packets are processed from the /dev/datum device and handled in datum_pts_receive().  Since an attacker would be required to somehow control a malicious /dev/datum device, this does not appear to be a practical attack and renders this issue "Low" in terms of severity.  Affects: All versions of NTP, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p10, and ntp-4.3.0 up to, but not including ntp-4.3.94.  Mitigation:  Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1433995#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-20 14:01:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the NTP project Upstream: Cure53   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1433995#c4)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-23 10:08:20 UTC  ``` Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1435163](show_bug.cgi?id=1435163 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-6464 CVE-2017-6462 CVE-2017-6463 CVE-2017-6458 CVE-2017-6451 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1433995#c6)  Karel Volný    2017-04-03 08:53:56 UTC  ``` do we have a reproducer for this?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1433995#c8)  Kurt Seifried    2017-04-07 19:30:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Karel Volný from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1433995#c6)) > do we have a reproducer for this?

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1493452#c0)  Miroslav Lichvar    2017-09-20 08:52:21 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When ntpd starts, it immediately resets the kernel clock status to STA_PLL without STA_UNSYNC, before the clock is actually synchronized. This enables synchronization of the RTC and misleads applications that use ntp_gettime()/adjtimex() to check when the clock is synchronized.

# RHSA-2017:3071 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: ntp security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A3071)

## Topic

An update for ntp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

Security Fix(es):

* Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the NTP server's parsing of configuration directives. A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a crafted message. (CVE-2017-6463, CVE-2017-6464)
* A vulnerability was found in NTP, in the parsing of packets from the /dev/datum device. A malicious device could send crafted messages, causing ntpd to crash. (CVE-2017-6462)

Red Hat would like to thank the NTP project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Cure53 as the original reporter of these issues.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1434002#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-20 14:11:09 UTC  ``` A vulnerability found in the NTP server allows an authenticated remote attacker to crash the daemon by sending an invalid setting via the :config directive.  The unpeer option expects a number or an address as an argument.  In case the value is "0", a segmentation fault occurs.  Affects: All versions of ntp, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p10, and ntp-4.3.0 up to, but not including ntp-4.3.94.  Mitigation:  Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1434002#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-20 14:11:15 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the NTP project Upstream: Cure53   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1434002#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-23 10:08:31 UTC  ``` Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1435163](show_bug.cgi?id=1435163 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-6464 CVE-2017-6462 CVE-2017-6463 CVE-2017-6458 CVE-2017-6451 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1434002#c5)  nupur priya    2017-04-27 07:39:56 UTC  ``` when ntp-4.2.8p 10 will be released with this fix?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1434002#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-10-26 07:04:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:3071 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3071](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3071)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1434002#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-10 08:26:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:0855 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0855](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0855)   ``` |  |

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.
