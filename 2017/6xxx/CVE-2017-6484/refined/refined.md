Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the "c" and "cred" HTTP POST parameters within the `resetpassword.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users. The vulnerability is present in `INTER-Mediator-master/Auth_Support/PasswordReset/resetpassword.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the vulnerable website, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Website defacement
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious actions depending on the attacker's code

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious script through the "cred" parameter in a POST request.
*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious script through the "c" parameter in the URL

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, either via a link or through a crafted web form.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges and can exploit the vulnerability by making requests from any browser.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability exists in INTER-Mediator version 5.5 and probably prior versions.
* The proof-of-concept exploits include JavaScript's `alert()` function to demonstrate the XSS, and confirm that arbitrary code can be injected.
* The "cred" parameter exploitation uses a POST request, while the "c" parameter uses a GET request.

This analysis provides more detail than a basic CVE description might.
