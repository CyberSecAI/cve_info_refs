The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in BigTree CMS versions 4.1.18 and 4.2.16.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF tokens in several features, specifically:
    - User Deletion
    - Colophon Information Changing (footer modification)
    - Navigation Social Changing (social media link modification)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352, CAPEC-62):** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- Missing CSRF protection: The mentioned features lack the proper implementation of CSRF tokens to protect against malicious requests.
- Insufficient protection using Referer header: Although the application uses the Referer header for some protection, this protection is insufficient and can be bypassed, and is not implemented for the vulnerable features.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can:
    - **Delete registered users:** Potentially causing disruption and loss of access.
    - **Change the Colophon Information (footer):** Injecting malicious or misleading content.
    - **Change the Navigation Social links:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or phishing pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious webpage that makes requests to the vulnerable BigTree CMS instance on behalf of a logged-in victim.
- The victim, while authenticated, visits the attacker-controlled page.
- The attacker-controlled page automatically triggers the forged requests, leading to the actions mentioned above without the user's consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to entice a logged-in user to visit a malicious webpage or other medium controlled by the attacker (e.g., a malicious link in an email).
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the requests required to exploit the vulnerable features (deleting users, modifying footers, and navigation).
