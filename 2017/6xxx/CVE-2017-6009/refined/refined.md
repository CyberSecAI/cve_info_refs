  "cve": "CVE-2017-6009",
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "icoutils",
    "versions": [
      "0.31.1",
       "0.29.1-5deb7u2",
      "0.31.0-2+deb8u3",
      "0.31.2-1"

  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `decode_ne_resource_id` function in `restable.c` does not validate the size of the data to be copied before performing the memcpy operation. This can lead to a negative value being used for the size parameter in memcpy, resulting in a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
        "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted executable file processed by wrestool could cause memory corruption, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted .exe file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious executable file with a malformed resource section that triggers the vulnerability in `decode_ne_resource_id`.",
    "position": "Attacker needs to have the user process the malformed file."
  },
    "patch_details": {
        "fixes": [
            "The vulnerability is addressed by implementing a check on the length parameter before performing the `memcpy` operation, preventing the integer overflow."
