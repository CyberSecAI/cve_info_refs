Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the CLI command-parsing code of the Cisco StarOS operating system. It allows an attacker to break out of the StarOS CLI and execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-78): The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input to CLI commands, which allows an attacker to inject malicious shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands as the Linux *root* user on the affected system.
- Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the device, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate the system, steal data, or launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the device's console or via SSH.
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to have a valid, but non-administrative, user account to log in to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access to a non-administrative user account on the affected device via console or SSH.
- Ability to use one of several vulnerable Cisco StarOS CLI commands to inject malicious commands.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 5000, 5500, and 5700 Series devices and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) Software running Cisco StarOS.
- There are no workarounds to address the vulnerability; software updates are required.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS base score of 8.2 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a support case.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.
