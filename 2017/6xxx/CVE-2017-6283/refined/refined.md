- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The RSA function in the NVIDIA Security Engine clears the keyslot read/write lock permissions upon a chip reset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper permission handling during chip reset.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the keyslots.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device and requires low privileges.
