Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a command injection vulnerability in the `customfmt` parameter of NfSen/AlienVault OSSIM. Specifically, user-controlled input is passed to a shell command without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands through the `customfmt` parameter.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input before using it in a shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution as root:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system with root privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Full system control:** The attacker can take complete control over the system, allowing them to potentially install malware, steal sensitive data, create backdoors, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted request to the NfSen/AlienVault netflow processing web page.
- **Authenticated Access or Stolen Session ID:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user or have a stolen PHP Session ID to leverage the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication or Session Access:** The attacker must either have legitimate credentials to access the web interface or have a stolen PHP session ID.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web interface of the vulnerable system.
