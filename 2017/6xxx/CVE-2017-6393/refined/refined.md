Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the `object_id` HTTP GET parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-controlled input passed via the `object_id` parameter before using it in the `std_table.php` page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary HTML and script code execution in the context of the vulnerable website.
- An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser, leading to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted HTTP GET request with malicious JavaScript code in the `object_id` parameter, as shown in the provided PoC:
  ```
  http://localhost/.../nagvis-master/share/userfiles/gadgets/std_table.php?object_id=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22
  ```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the payload and make the victim access it. This can be achieved by social engineering, sending emails with a link, or exploiting vulnerabilities in other services of the same organization that can embed the link.
