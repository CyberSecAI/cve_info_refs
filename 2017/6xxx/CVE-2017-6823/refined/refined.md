{
  "Root cause": "The application does not properly validate the 'level' parameter during user profile updates.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Privilege Escalation",
    "Lack of input validation on user level parameter"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user with lower privileges (e.g., editor) can manipulate the 'level' parameter during profile edit to gain higher privileges (e.g., super administrator).",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST request to the user profile edit endpoint",
    "Manipulation of the 'level' parameter in the POST data using a tool like Burp Suite"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user on the Fiyo CMS platform. They need the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a web proxy tool."
