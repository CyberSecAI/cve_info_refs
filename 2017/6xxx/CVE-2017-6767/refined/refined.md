Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) handles SSH connections using remote authentication. When a user connects via SSH with remote authentication (e.g., TACACS or RADIUS), APIC grants the user the privileges of the last user who logged in, instead of those associated with the remote user's account. If the previous user had higher privileges, the new user will inherit those elevated permissions, not the actual ones defined for the user's account, but the user cannot gain root level privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege escalation: An authenticated user can gain higher privileges than assigned.
- Incorrect privilege assignment: User sessions are not being isolated correctly, causing privilege inheritance.
- Improper handling of remote authentication: The system does not properly map the authenticated remote user to the correct privilege set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain higher privileges on the APIC system, allowing for unauthorized access and modifications.
- The attacker cannot obtain root-level privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker via SSH: An attacker connects via SSH to the local management interface of the APIC system.
- Remote user credentials: The attack requires the use of remote user authentication (e.g., TACACS or RADIUS).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid remote user credentials: The attacker must have valid credentials for a remote user account on the APIC.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to connect via SSH to the APIC management interface.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered if the remote authentication server does not configure a Cisco AV pair that includes a unique UNIX User Identifier. Without this, the system assigns the same default identifier to all remote users.
- The vulnerability is not present if the connection uses the REST API or GUI interface (except for the "Launch SSH" feature within the GUI).
- Locally configured users are not vulnerable.

This analysis provides more technical detail than the original CVE description by specifying the conditions required for the vulnerability to be exploited and the specific mechanism of the privilege escalation.
