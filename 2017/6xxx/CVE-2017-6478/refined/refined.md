The provided content relates to CVE-2017-6478.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the `step` HTTP parameter within the `install/index.php` script. Specifically, the script directly uses the `$_GET['step']` value without any sanitization, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization of the `step` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `step` parameter of the URL. When a victim clicks on this crafted URL, the attacker's JavaScript code will execute in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This allows the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the website
    - Perform other malicious actions within the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript in the `step` parameter and sends it to a victim.
- When the victim clicks on the URL, the malicious JavaScript is executed within the victim's browser.
- The vulnerable script is `install/index.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
- The attacker needs to be able to send this URL to a victim.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
