The provided content is a security advisory from Veritas, which includes details of multiple vulnerabilities, one of which is CVE-2017-6406.

**CVE-2017-6406**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** NetBackup services execute commands from a whitelist of directories. A local user can escape this whitelist by using directory traversal sequences such as "../" in the path, allowing the execution of arbitrary commands on the system.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper path handling and insufficient validation of user-provided paths, leading to directory traversal.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary command execution with root/admin privileges on the affected system.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local access to the NetBackup server or client, allowing an attacker to manipulate the command path.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the NetBackup server or client.
