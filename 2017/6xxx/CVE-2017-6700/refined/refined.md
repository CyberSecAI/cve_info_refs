Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Document Object Model (DOM) based cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DOM-based XSS (CWE-79):** The application doesn't properly sanitize user-controlled data used in the client-side scripts, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious actions such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Phishing attacks (redirecting the user to malicious websites)
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Information theft

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via a network connection.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a user interacting with the affected web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to inject malicious code into the web application to be executed in a victim's browser, which requires luring a user into interacting with the crafted URL/data.
- The user needs to interact with the malicious data that is in the web interface to be impacted, i.e., "user interaction" is required.
