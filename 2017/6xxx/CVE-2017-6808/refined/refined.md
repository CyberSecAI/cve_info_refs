- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` HTTP parameter within the `admin.faq.php` file. Specifically, the value of the `$_GET['id']` parameter is directly used without any filtering or encoding.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies/session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `id` parameter of the `admin.faq.php` file. The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL containing the exploit and then lure a victim into clicking the link. No direct access to the server or application is required.
