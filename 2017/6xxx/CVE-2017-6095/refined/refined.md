The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities within the Mail Masta WordPress plugin version 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities in different PHP files of the plugin.
- Vulnerable parameters include `list_id`, `filter_list`, `camp_id`, and `id` passed via GET and POST requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, or compromising the entire WordPress database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated SQLi:**
    - GET parameter `list_id` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/lists/csvexport.php` can be exploited without authentication.
- **Authenticated SQLi:**
    - GET parameter `filter_list` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/lists/view-list.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
    - POST parameter `camp_id` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
     - POST parameter `list_id` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign_save.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
    - GET parameter `id` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/view-campaign-list.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
    - GET parameter `id` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/view-campaign.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
    - GET parameter `filter_list` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/lists/add_member.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
    - GET parameter `id` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/lists/edit-list.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
   - GET parameters `filter_list`, `member_id` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/lists/edit_member.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
    - GET parameter `id` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/campaign-delete.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.
  - POST parameters `list_id`, `subscriber_email` in `/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/subscriber_list.php`, which requires WordPress admin privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For unauthenticated SQLi, the attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- For authenticated SQLi, the attacker requires WordPress administrator privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints with malicious SQL payloads within the specified parameters.
