- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the DNS code of Cisco ASA Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition that can be triggered via specially crafted DNS packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload or corrupt the information present in the device's local DNS cache. This could result in disruption of services, loss of connectivity and device reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting a vulnerability within the DNS functionality by sending crafted DNS packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need any privileges and can be remote (unauthenticated, remote attacker). The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device and the device must be configured with at least one DNS server IP address configured under a DNS server group.
