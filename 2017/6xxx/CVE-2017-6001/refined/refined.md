{
  "CVE-2017-6001": {
    "description": "A race condition was found in the Linux kernel, present since v3.14-rc1 through v4.12. The race happens between threads of inotify_handle_event() and vfs_rename() while running the rename operation against the same file. As a result of the race the next slab data or the slab's free list pointer can be corrupted with attacker-controlled data, which may lead to the privilege escalation.",
    "vulnerability": "Race condition between multiple sys_perf_event_open() calls.",
    "impact": "A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash), corrupt kernel memory leading to a kernel crash or privilege escalation.",
     "attack_vector": "Local",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access with the ability to call `sys_perf_event_open`.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when multiple threads concurrently try to move a software group into a hardware context using `sys_perf_event_open`. The race happens because the event->ctx relationship can be changed while a thread is waiting for a mutex, causing a stale (and possibly dead) context to be used when the thread acquires the locks. The fix adds validation to ensure the context is still valid after acquiring the locks, and prevent the race condition from happening."
