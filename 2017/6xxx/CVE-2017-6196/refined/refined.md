Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `i_free_object()` function of GPL Ghostscript.
- This occurs due to a double free of memory associated with an image enumerator. Specifically, the memory is allocated in `gx_begin_image1()` or `gx_begin_image4()`, freed in `gx_image_enum_begin()` in certain error conditions, and then potentially freed again in `gx_begin_image?()` when `gx_image_enum_begin()` returns an error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free, which arises when memory is freed, and then an attempt is made to access that freed memory.
- **Double Free:** The root cause is a double free scenario because the image enumerator memory may be freed twice in different code paths.
- **Memory Management Error:** Incorrect handling of memory allocation and deallocation leads to the vulnerability. Specifically, `gx_image_enum_begin()` attempts to free memory it did not allocate in multiple exit paths of the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions that successful exploitation could result in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running Ghostscript. The use-after-free condition can be exploited to overwrite memory, and potentially control the program's execution flow.
- **Denial of Service:** The advisory also mentions a potential Denial of Service condition. A crash due to the use-after-free is likely, but the ability to trigger arbitrary code execution also means an attacker might be able to control the process without crashing it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted PostScript or PDF files:** An attacker can embed malicious PostScript code within a document (PostScript or PDF), designed to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability when processed by Ghostscript.
- **User interaction:** A user needs to open the crafted file with a vulnerable version of Ghostscript for the exploit to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation/Modification:** The attacker needs the capability to create or modify a PostScript or PDF file to include the malicious payload.
- **User Enticement:** The attacker needs to entice a user to open the crafted file using a vulnerable version of Ghostscript. This could be through social engineering, phishing, or embedding the file in a website.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report provides a Proof of Concept (POC) that triggers the use-after-free condition using `gs` command with specific parameters. The details in the bug report, such as the ASAN output including the call stack, provide more technical depth than the official CVE description.
- The bug was resolved by removing the freeing of the enumerator object from the `gx_image_enum_begin` function when it was not the one to allocate the object, fixing the double free and thus the use-after-free.
