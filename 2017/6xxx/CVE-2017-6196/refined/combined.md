# GPL Ghostscript: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201708-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in GPL Ghostscript, the
worst of which can resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/ghostscript-gpl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.21** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.21** |

### Background

Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GPL Ghostscript. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for additional information.

### Impact

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted PostScript file or PDF document using GPL Ghostscript possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GPL Ghostscript users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/ghostscript-gpl-9.21"

```

The enumerator is allocated in gx_begin_image?() and freed there if gx_image_enum_begin() returns an error, which is I believe the correct course.  However, gx_image_enum_begin() also frees the enumerator on an error, except that it doesn't always do so. Its a large function and there are at least 9 ways to exit it, only 4 of which free the enumerator.  Since gx_image_enum_begin() didn't allocate the memory I feel it should not free it either. My proposal for this is to remove the cases in here where the enumerator memory is freed. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=697596#c2)  Ken Sharp    2017-02-20 01:50:04 UTC  ``` Fixed in commit [ecceafe3abba2714ef9b432035fe0739d9b1a283](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?ecceafe3abba2714ef9b432035fe0739d9b1a283)  Thanks for the report, very well spotted! ``` |  |
