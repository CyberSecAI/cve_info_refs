Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-6318:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `saned` daemon in `sane-backends` incorrectly handles the `SANE_NET_CONTROL_OPTION` request when the `value_type` is `SANE_TYPE_STRING`. Specifically, when a request specifies a `value_size` larger than the actual length of the requested string, the response packet includes uninitialized memory contents from the server.
- When handling a `SANE_NET_CONTROL_OPTION` request with `SANE_ACTION_GET_VALUE` and `SANE_TYPE_STRING`, the code allocates a buffer based on the size of the provided value, not the expected size of the response, which can lead to a smaller buffer being allocated for the string value. Then the backend writes a string value longer than the allocated buffer causing a heap buffer overflow on the server side.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information disclosure:** The server sends back uninitialized memory contents, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Memory corruption:** The server writes beyond the allocated buffer for the value, which can corrupt memory leading to unexpected behavior or crashes
- **Heap buffer overflow:** Due to the smaller than expected buffer allocated, a heap buffer overflow occurs when writing the value.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the server's memory.
- Memory corruption may cause the `saned` service to crash or behave erratically.

**Attack vectors:**

- A remote attacker sends a crafted `SANE_NET_CONTROL_OPTION` request to the `saned` service. The crafted packet must have `value_type == SANE_TYPE_STRING` and `value_size` larger than the actual string length to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs network access to the `saned` service.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted `SANE_NET_CONTROL_OPTION` packets to the vulnerable service.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability has been present since 1999 and affects all `sane-backends` versions before the fix.
- The issue is triggered by a size mismatch in the handling of string values within the `SANE_NET_CONTROL_OPTION` request.
- The fix involves correctly allocating memory to accommodate the maximum size of the string value and handling the size of the data to be written.
- The vulnerability is present in the `frontend/saned.c` file.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to read arbitrary parts of memory.
- The `saned` daemon is not intended to be exposed to the Internet or other untrusted networks. It is recommended to restrict access via a firewall.
