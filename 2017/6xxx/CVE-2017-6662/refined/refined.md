Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XML injection flaw present in the web-based user interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  XML Injection: The vulnerability stems from improper handling of XML data in the web interface, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application is not properly validating or sanitizing user-supplied XML data, which allows malicious XML to be processed by the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- Read/Write Access: An attacker can gain unauthorized read and write access to information stored in the system. This includes potentially sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network via the web-based user interface.
- Authenticated Access: The attacker requires valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability. It's not an anonymous attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid User Credentials: An attacker must have valid credentials for a user account on the vulnerable Cisco Prime Infrastructure or Evolved Programmable Network Manager system.
- Network Access: The attacker must be able to reach the web interface of the vulnerable system over the network.
