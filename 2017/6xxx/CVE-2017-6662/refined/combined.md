The attacker must have valid user credentials.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products**Cisco Prime Infrastructure**      Cisco Prime Infrastructure software releases 1.1 through 3.1.6 are vulnerable. To determine the software release that is running on the appliance, administrators can use the following methods.   1. The administrator can issue the **show version** command from the console CLI. The following output is from an affected application running PI software release 3.1.0 with the PI Maintenance Release 3.1.6 installed:   ```    piconsole# show versionCisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 3.1ADE-OS Build Version: 3.1.0.001ADE-OS System Architecture: x86_64Copyright (c) 2009-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.All rights reserved.Hostname: lmpy-spc-princessVersion information of installed applications---------------------------------------------Cisco Prime Infrastructure********************************************************Version : 3.1.0Build : 3.1.0.0.132Critical Fixes:        PI 3.1.6 Maintenance Release ( 6.0.0 )Device Support:        Prime Infrastructure 3.1 Device Pack 11 ( 11.0 )    ```   3. The administrator can view the PI release and maintenance release updates by connecting to the web interface using the **http(s)://** access URL. The PI software release is displayed on the welcome screen and the administrator can click **View Installed Update**,which opens a pop-up window with the list of PI maintenance releases and patches. The following is an example of text that is displayed in the pop-up window for PI software release 3.1:      ```       Cisco Prime Infrastructure       Version 3.1   View Installed Update       ```      The pop-up window will display the list of maintenance release updates in the format:      ```       Update NamePI 3.1.6 Maintenance Release       ```   4. The administrator can also view the PI release and maintenance releases by logging in to the web interface using the **http(s)://** access URL and navigating to the **Gear > About Prime Infrastructure > View Installed Updates** screen. The release information is displayed as follows:      ```       Installed UpdatesCritical Fixes Update Name            Version PI 3.1.6 Maintenance Rel...    6.0.0Device Support Update Name             Prime Infrastructure 3.1       ```**Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager**   Cisco EPNM software releases 1.2, 2.0, and 2.1 are vulnerable.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Indicators of Compromise  * No indicators of compromise have been identified for this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html) Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.8 |
