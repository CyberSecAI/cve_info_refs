Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6637

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal issue in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software. This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths and access files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The software fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically file paths, allowing an attacker to access files and directories they should not have access to.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, an authenticated attacker can delete arbitrary files from the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Integrity Impact:** The primary impact is the ability to delete arbitrary files on the affected system.
*   **No Confidentiality Impact:** The vulnerability is focused on file deletion not information disclosure.
*   **No Availability Impact:** Although not explicitly stated in the impact, deleting critical system files would result in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to access the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable system over a network.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS base score of 6.5.
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software releases prior to Release 11.1.
*   The vulnerability was reported by rgod, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Cisco has released a fix for this vulnerability in release 11.1 and later.
*   No workarounds are available.
