# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Quest Privilege Manager 6.0.0.xx (CVE-2017-6553, CVE-2017-6554)

Posted on [April 7, 2017](https://0xdeadface.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-quest-privilege-manager-6-0-0-xx-cve-2017-6553-cve-2017-6554/ "2:07 pm") by [m0t](https://0xdeadface.wordpress.com/author/hjwalrus/ "View all posts by m0t")

### Product

Quest Privilege Manager

### Overview

Two input validation vulnerabilities were identified in the pmmasterd daemon, included with Quest Privilege Manager that allow a remote attacker to compromise the system, gaining remote code execution on the system, with the privilege of the daemon (by default running as root)

Details follow below

## Privilege Manager pmmasterd Arbitrary File Write (CVE-2017-6554)

### Version affected

Quest Privilege Manager <= 6.0.0-50

### Description

By sending a specially crafted request (action code ACT\_NEWFILESENT ) to the pmserviced/pmmasterd daemon listening on port 12345, it’s possible to write anywhere on the filesystem, with root permission. This can be abused by a remote attacker to gain full control of the system.

The server is only vulnerable when configured as a policy server (although it’s irrelevant if it is a policy server for Privilege Manager for Unix or Sudo Plugin)

### CVE ID

CVE-2017-6554

### Exploit

<https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41861/>

###

## Privilege Manager pmmasterd Buffer Overflow (CVE-2017-6553)

### Version affected

Quest Privilege Manager <= 6.0.0-50

### Description

By sending a specially crafted request (action code ACT\_ALERT\_EVENT ) to the pmserviced/pmmasterd daemon on port 12345 to a Privilege Manager Server system (again, policy server or sudo plugin manager is irrelevant), it’s possible to corrupt the pmmasterd process memory. This can exploited to perform DoS, leak process memory or execute arbitrary code in the context of the process.

This appears to be related to an unsafe memcpy call in the function pmm\_handle\_incoming\_ping() where the size argument is taken from untrusted user input.

This can be abused by a remote attacker to gain full control of the system.

### CVE ID

CVE-2017-6553

### **Exploit**

The developed exploit works against pmmasterd 6.0.0-27, (on x86 and x86\_64 architectures). Although versions up to 6.0.0-50 were also found to be vulnerable, more recent versions also include a stack cookie check on a number of functions, including the vulnerable one.

Although this could be solved by combining the attack with a memory leak, this would have to happen during the same connection, as the pmmasterd daemon is spawned from pmserviced on every connection request, and then terminated.

### Recommendation

Deploy the latest vendor updates. Both issues have been fixed in version 6.0.0-61.

  **Privilege Manager for Unix Hotfix 6.0.0.061 Release Notes**
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This is a Maintenance Fix Release for Privilege Manager for Unix 6.0.0.061.

  Below is a complete list of all included changes to the Privilege Manager for Unix product since the
  Privilege Manager for Unix 6.0 release.

  Fixes are cumulative unless otherwise noted.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Defects Fixed in Privilege Manager for Unix Hotfix 6.0.0.061**
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Please see attachment 'PrivilegeManager4UnixHotfix\_600\_061\_Readme' below for release notes.
* ## Resolution

  **RESOLUTION:**

  Please download and install Hotfix, Privilege Manager for Unix 6.0.0.061 for Solution 133824 by [Clicking Here](https://support.oneidentity.com/download-install-detail/6077116) for server policy packages.

  Client packages can be downloaded [Here](https://support.oneidentity.com/download-install-detail/6061755)

  **The following is a list of issues resolved in this hotfix.**

  | **Resolved Issue** | **Issue ID** |
  | --- | --- |
  | Two security vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-6553 - pmmasterd buffer overflow & CVE-2017-6554 - pmmasterd arbitrary file write) were addressed, by which a remote attacker could gain control of the policy server. Validation code has been added and obsolete code removed to secure the pmmasterd daemon against these vulnerabilities. | 0006556 |
  | The pmlogsrvd sometimes would not respond to terminate signal (kill -15) leaving it in a loop doing nothing and consuming CPU resources. | 0006553 |
  | The pmpolicy program will filter out double quote (“) characters from commit messages to prevent issues in MCU when generating the “policy changes” report. | 0006546 |
  | The pmlogsrvd will periodically remove events from the event cache that cannot be processed. | 0006537 |
  | When the policy server is very busy, the mktemp() policy function may use an malformed filename causing an error message similar to the following when opening the iolog file:pmmasterd6.0.0 (040):3361.01 open iolog log: : Invalid argumentThe pmmasterd now protects against this by retrying to generate the filename and open the iolog file if a failure occurs. | 0006548 |
  | Fixed memory leak and modified the evcache processing to improve memory usage.Two new pm.settings values have been introduced:EventQueueProcessLimit – Limits the number of cached events that will be processed at a time (to limit memory usage). Default value is 0 (no limit)EventQueueFlush – Interval in minutes in which the pmlogsrvd process reopens the eventlog database, thereby flushing the data used in memory.  Default is 0 (the database is kept open while the service is running). | 0006547 |
  | Using the getstringpasswd() function would crash pmmasterd and cause the session to fail. This has now been fixed. | 0006544 |
  | pmlogsearch will now return partial results if secondary policy servers are unavailable instead of returning an error, so that MCU can display the partial results. | 0006542 |
  | Several settings were not able to be configured via the -d option in pmjoin and pmsrvconfig.  All valid settings are now recognized by the -d option. | 0006540 |
  | On Linux platforms fixed a stdout issue for print() statements when running multiple commands (one of which being pmrun) via ssh. | 0006536 |
  | Changes to the runhost variable within the policy were being reset, causing the changes to be ignored. | 0006531 |

  **Applicability of this hotfix**

  ***Products affected by this hotfix:***

  | **Product Name** | **Version** |
  | --- | --- |
  | Privilege Manager for Unix | 6.0.0 versions prior to 6.0.0 (061) |

  **To install this hotfix:**

  Before applying this hotfix, ensure you have an appropriate backup of your machine.

  Depending on your platform's package management software, you may be required to remove previous versions to upgrade to a newer version.

  Copy the installation files to temporary directory.
  Change directory to the package location and run the platform specific package install program to install the desired package.

  For example, on a Redhat based x86\_64 system, you may use rpm --upgrade to upgrade the server package:

  **rpm --upgrade qpm-server-6.0.0-50-x86\_64.rpm**

  **Determining if This Hotfix Is Installed**
  To determine if this hotfix is installed:
  Verify the build number by running "pmrun -v" and "pmlocald -v" (the build number is displayed in parenthesis):

  /opt/quest/bin/pmrun -v
  /opt/quest/sbin/pmlocald -v

  **Removing This Hotfix**
  To remove this hotfix:
  Use the platform specific package management software to remove the installed package and re-install to the previous installed version.

  For example, on a Redhat based x86\_64 system, you may use the rpm --oldpackage option to rollback the server package:

  **rpm --upgrade --oldpackage qpm-server\_6.0.0-*version*>-x86\_64.rpm**

  (On policy servers only) If reverting to a version prior to 6.0.0 (032), change the pmpolicy service user's shell to a standard UNIX shell (e.g. /bin/bash)

  usermod -s /bin/bash pmpolicy

# Quest Privilege Manager pmmasterd Buffer Overflow

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### Quest Privilege Manager pmmasterd Buffer Overflow

Disclosed
04/09/2017

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This modules exploits a buffer overflow in the Quest Privilege Manager,
a software used to integrate Active Directory with Linux and Unix
systems. The vulnerability exists in the pmmasterd daemon, and can only
triggered when the host has been configured as a policy server (
Privilege Manager for Unix or Quest Sudo Plugin). A buffer overflow
condition exists when handling requests of type ACT\_ALERT\_EVENT, where
the size of a memcpy can be controlled by the attacker. This module
only works against version < 6.0.0-27. Versions up to 6.0.0-50 are also
vulnerable, but not supported by this module (a stack cookie bypass is
required). NOTE: To use this module it is required to be able to bind a
privileged port ( <=1024 ) as the server refuses connections coming
from unprivileged ports, which in most situations means that root
privileges are required.

#### Architectures

cmd

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/linux/misc/quest_pmmasterd_bof.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/linux/misc/quest_pmmasterd_bof.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/linux/misc/quest_pmmasterd_bof
msf exploit(quest_pmmasterd_bof) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(quest_pmmasterd_bof) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(quest_pmmasterd_bof) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(quest_pmmasterd_bof) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/linux/http/f5_icall_cmd
msf exploit(f5_icall_cmd) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(f5_icall_cmd) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(f5_icall_cmd) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(f5_icall_cmd) > exploit
```

### Metasploit

Penetration testing software for offensive security teams.

Key Features

* [Collect and share all the information you need to conduct a successful and efficient penetration test](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Simulate complex attacks against your systems and users](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Test your defenses to make sure they’re ready](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Automate Every Step of Your Penetration Test](/products/metasploit/features)

[Free Metasploit Pro Trial](/try/metasploit-pro/)

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Quest Privilege Manager 6.0.0.xx (CVE-2017-6553, CVE-2017-6554)

Posted on [April 7, 2017](https://0xdeadface.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-quest-privilege-manager-6-0-0-xx-cve-2017-6553-cve-2017-6554/ "2:07 pm") by [m0t](https://0xdeadface.wordpress.com/author/hjwalrus/ "View all posts by m0t")

### Product

Quest Privilege Manager

### Overview

Two input validation vulnerabilities were identified in the pmmasterd daemon, included with Quest Privilege Manager that allow a remote attacker to compromise the system, gaining remote code execution on the system, with the privilege of the daemon (by default running as root)

Details follow below

## Privilege Manager pmmasterd Arbitrary File Write (CVE-2017-6554)

### Version affected

Quest Privilege Manager <= 6.0.0-50

### Description

By sending a specially crafted request (action code ACT\_NEWFILESENT ) to the pmserviced/pmmasterd daemon listening on port 12345, it’s possible to write anywhere on the filesystem, with root permission. This can be abused by a remote attacker to gain full control of the system.

The server is only vulnerable when configured as a policy server (although it’s irrelevant if it is a policy server for Privilege Manager for Unix or Sudo Plugin)

### CVE ID

CVE-2017-6554

### Exploit

<https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41861/>

###

## Privilege Manager pmmasterd Buffer Overflow (CVE-2017-6553)

### Version affected

Quest Privilege Manager <= 6.0.0-50

### Description

By sending a specially crafted request (action code ACT\_ALERT\_EVENT ) to the pmserviced/pmmasterd daemon on port 12345 to a Privilege Manager Server system (again, policy server or sudo plugin manager is irrelevant), it’s possible to corrupt the pmmasterd process memory. This can exploited to perform DoS, leak process memory or execute arbitrary code in the context of the process.

This appears to be related to an unsafe memcpy call in the function pmm\_handle\_incoming\_ping() where the size argument is taken from untrusted user input.

This can be abused by a remote attacker to gain full control of the system.

### CVE ID

CVE-2017-6553

### **Exploit**

The developed exploit works against pmmasterd 6.0.0-27, (on x86 and x86\_64 architectures). Although versions up to 6.0.0-50 were also found to be vulnerable, more recent versions also include a stack cookie check on a number of functions, including the vulnerable one.

Although this could be solved by combining the attack with a memory leak, this would have to happen during the same connection, as the pmmasterd daemon is spawned from pmserviced on every connection request, and then terminated.

### Recommendation

Deploy the latest vendor updates. Both issues have been fixed in version 6.0.0-61.

# F5 ICall::Script Privilege Escalation (CVE-2015-3628)

Posted on [December 1, 2015](https://0xdeadface.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/f5-icallscript-privilege-escalation-cve-2015-3628/ "11:28 am") by [m0t](https://0xdeadface.wordpress.com/author/hjwalrus/ "View all posts by m0t")

Earlier this year, I was able to discover a vulnerability in the F5 BIG-IP LTM product that allows a user with limited access to the system to escalate his privileges and obtain highly privileged remote command execution on the device.

In this post we’ll show how to manually exploit the vulnerability. A Metasploit module is now available to automate the process – see <https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/f5_icall_cmd> for details.

**Overview:**

The issue was identified in the SOAP interface exposed by the devices at <https://<host>/iControl/iControlPortal.cgi> (a similar issue, although on a completely different function, was previously found in this same interface –  see CVE-2014-2928 for details). An attacker with valid credentials for the web interface and the “Resource Administrator” role can abuse the [iCall](https://devcentral.f5.com/icall/getting-started) SOAP functions to run arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.

Using the iCall interface it’s possible to create and run management scripts, these are executed by a Tcl interpreter effectively running with root privileges.

See the [F5 Security Advisory](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/16000/700/sol16728.html) for a list of vulnerable versions.

**Proof-Of-Concept:**

The following steps demonstrate the attack by retrieving the “/etc/shadow” file, containing all password hashes from the device. However, it is possible to obtain a root command shell on the device using the same method.

For purpose of demonstration a user named “test” with the “Resource Administrator” role and password “default” has been created on the device. This user was defined without any shell access.

The following HTTP POST request will create an iCall script on the device, the malicious payload **exec /bin/sh -c “id>/var/local/ucs/lol.ucs;cat /etc/shadow >>/var/local/ucs/lol.ucs;chmod a+r /var/local/ucs/lol.ucs”** is highlighted.

The executed script does not return any output, however, the content of the shadow password file will be copied into a directory used to store configuration backups for the device. From here it is be possible to retrieve it using the web interface, as will be demonstrated later. We’ll include also in the file the output from the “id” command, to show that the commands are executed as root.

Request:

```

 </soapenv:Envelope>
```

Response:

```

```

To trigger execution of the script the iCall interface provides different types of handlers; in this case a PeriodicHandler will be used with the following request:

```
POST /iControl/iControlPortal.cgi HTTP/1.1
 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
 Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8

```

Response:

```

 <E:Body>

```

From this point the script will be executed every 30 seconds by the generated handler.

The output file can be retrieved by logging into the device and navigating to System->Archives, as shown in the following screenshots:

```

**Remediation:**

Apply vendor patches. If this is not feasible, review configuration for any accounts in the Resource Administrator role. Update the configuration to use provide the least privilege necessary while acknowledging the Resource Administrators have unconstrained privileges patches for this issue are applied.
