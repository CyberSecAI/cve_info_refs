Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-6543:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flaw in Tenable Nessus (before 6.10.2) and Tenable Appliance (before 4.5.0) on Windows systems allowed an authenticated attacker to upload a crafted file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
- Ability to write files to arbitrary locations on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could upload a crafted file to any location on the system.
- This could be leveraged for privilege escalation by executing the crafted file (e.g., after a reboot).
- Complete control over the system via arbitrary file write and subsequent execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, authenticated attacker.
- Crafted file upload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Nessus or Appliance system.
- The target system must be a Windows installation of Tenable Nessus or Tenable Appliance.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Windows installations.
- Tenable recommends that Nessus be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.
- The CVSS v2 score is based on the immediate impact (arbitrary file write), and does not reflect the follow-up impact requiring administrator actions for full privilege escalation.
- Tenable released Nessus version 6.10.2 and Appliance version 4.5.0 to address this issue.
