```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Edgewater Edgemarc devices have a 'User Commands' page that allows users to input specialized commands. These commands are executed by the system without proper sanitization or validation, leading to a blind OS command injection vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind OS command injection",
    "Lack of input sanitization and validation",
	"Reflective cross-site scripting"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the device. This can lead to a full compromise of the device, including the ability to pivot to other parts of the network the device is connected to.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to the 'User Commands' configuration page of the Edgemarc device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the device and valid credentials to access the web interface. Default credentials can be used, although changing the default password mitigates this aspect of the vulnerability."
