    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software contains multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-6741, that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code or cause a reload of the affected system. The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the SNMP subsystem.",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SNMP subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system via IPv4 or IPv6."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP (Versions 1, 2c, and 3). Devices configured with specific MIBs (ADSL-LINE-MIB, ALPS-MIB, CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB, CISCO-BSTUN-MIB, CISCO-MAC-AUTH-BYPASS-MIB, CISCO-SLB-EXT-MIB, CISCO-VOICE-DNIS-MIB, CISCO-VOICE-NUMBER-EXPANSION-MIB, TN3270E-RT-MIB) are vulnerable. These MIBs are enabled by default when SNMP is enabled. Exploit code is publicly available for CVE-2017-6741.",
