Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6657

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the EtherType field in network packets within Snort++. Snort++ stores all protocol decoders in a single array, indexed by EtherType/IP protocol numbers. Because valid EtherType and IP protocol numbers do not overlap, this was previously deemed safe. However, an attacker can craft a packet with an IP protocol number in the EtherType field, causing Snort++ to index the array with an invalid value. This leads to the wrong decoder being called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Decoder Selection:** Due to the lack of EtherType validation, Snort++ can select an incorrect decoder based on the manipulated EtherType field.
*   **Denial of Service:** This flaw can cause a crash because the selected decoder is not expecting the given packet type. For instance, an `eth:llc:snap:icmp6` packet will crash because it expects an IP6 header in order to compute the ICMP checksum.
*   **Affected Decoders**: gre, llc, trans_bridge, ciscometadata, linux_sll, and token_ring decoders are impacted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by sending crafted packets to a vulnerable Snort++ instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker sends a specially crafted network packet to the Snort++ instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior access or credentials on the target system to exploit this vulnerability. They can initiate the attack remotely over the network.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to create network packets with a specific IP protocol number in the EtherType field to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Snort++ (Snort 3) during its alpha testing stage. Current stable Snort releases are not affected.
*   The fix involves adding a check in the packet manager to validate the EtherType before indexing the decoder array. An out-of-range EtherType will raise alert 116:473.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the Snort team by Bhargava Shastry.
*   Fixes are available in the GitHub code repository tagged as BUILD\_233.
*   The Cisco advisory provides a CVSS v3 score of 8.6 with vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
