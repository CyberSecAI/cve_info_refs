The provided content is related to CVE-2017-6481.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient filtering of user-supplied data in multiple HTTP POST parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user input passed via POST parameters, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable website, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
HTTP POST requests with malicious payloads within specific parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable application.
The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability exists within the unauthenticated parts of the application.

**Specific vulnerable parameters and endpoints:**
- `instructions` parameter in POST request to `/app/admin/instructions/preview.php`
- `subnetId` parameter in POST request to `/app/admin/powerDNS/refresh-ptr-records.php`
