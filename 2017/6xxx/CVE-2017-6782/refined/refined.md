Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-6782:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- HTML Injection (CWE-94)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated, remote attacker could modify a page within the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure.
- The attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code which could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) like attacks, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks. The CVSS score reflects a limited confidentiality and integrity impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack (AV:N) via the administrative web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:L) to access the administrative web interface.
- User interaction is required (UI:R), which suggests the attacker needs to lure a user to interact with the crafted HTML page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- There are no known workarounds, so patching is the recommended remediation strategy.
- The CVSS base score is 5.4 with the vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`. The "S:C" indicates that the scope is changed by the exploit.
