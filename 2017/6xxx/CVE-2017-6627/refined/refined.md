Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-6627:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from changes in Cisco IOS Software application code that create UDP sockets but leave them idle without closing them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unclosed UDP Sockets:** The core issue is the presence of idle, unclosed UDP sockets within the Cisco IOS and IOS XE software. This is a resource management issue.
*   **Input Queue Overload:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to fill the input queue of the affected system with UDP packets, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a DoS condition. The affected device's input interface queue becomes wedged, preventing the device from processing UDP traffic correctly. The device is rendered unable to process network traffic properly.
*   **Interface Queue Wedge:** The input queue of the affected system becomes overloaded due to the crafted packets, leading to the "wedge."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **UDP Packets:** The attack involves sending specifically crafted UDP packets.
*   **Destination Port 0:** The attacker must send UDP packets to the affected device with a destination port of 0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any authentication or credentials to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Send Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to generate and send UDP packets to the affected device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability causes the interface queue to stop holding packets after 250 packets are received. However, this is still enough to cause a denial of service.
*   Exploitation of this vulnerability was observed in the wild starting March 2022.
*   Workarounds exist, involving either increasing the maximum hold queue value or creating access control lists that block UDP packets with destination port 0.
