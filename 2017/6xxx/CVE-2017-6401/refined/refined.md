The provided content is related to CVE-2017-6401.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the interaction between `bpcd` and `bpnbat`. `bpcd` runs with root/admin privileges and can execute any NetBackup command. `bpnbat` can execute any command on the local system. When `bpcd` is used to execute `bpnbat`, this allows for arbitrary command execution on the system as root/admin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Improper privilege management, where a process (`bpcd`) with root/admin privileges can be leveraged to execute another process (`bpnbat`) capable of arbitrary command execution
-  Lack of proper input validation or sanitization when `bpcd` executes `bpnbat`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected system with root/admin privileges, potentially leading to:
- Full system compromise
- Data exfiltration
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
A local user on the NetBackup server can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
A local user account on the NetBackup server or client is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker must be able to execute NetBackup commands via `bpcd`.

**Affected Products:**
*   NetBackup Server and Client 7.7.2 and 7.7.3 before April 2017 EEB
*   NetBackup Appliance before 2.7.2 and 2.7.3 before April 2017 EEB
*   Access 7.2.1 and earlier
