Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies in the web-based management interface of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA). Specifically, the issue is due to a lack of proper input sanitization leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability (CWE-79). This means that an attacker can inject malicious scripts into a webpage viewed by a user, which is not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing the user's session cookies
    *   Phishing: Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    *   Defacement: Modifying the content of the web page the user is viewing
    *  Data theft: Accessing sensitive data within the application

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.
*   **User Interaction**:  The attack requires user interaction. A user of the web-based management interface must click a malicious link or be tricked to access a crafted web page to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to the system.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL or web page containing the malicious JavaScript code.
*   The attacker must induce a user to visit this crafted URL or page within the context of the targeted web application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.1 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, which means:
    *   **AV:N (Network)**: The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    *  **AC:L (Low)**: The attack complexity is low.
    *   **PR:N (None)**: No privileges are required to perform the attack.
    *   **UI:R (Required)**: User interaction is required.
    *   **S:C (Changed)**: Scope is changed as the vulnerability impacts the target browser.
    *   **C:L (Low)**: Low impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:L (Low)**: Low impact on integrity.
    *   **A:N (None)**: No impact on availability.
*  Cisco has indicated that there are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability, and recommends upgrading to fixed software releases.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing by Cisco, and there is no indication of public exploits or malicious use at the time of the advisory release.
