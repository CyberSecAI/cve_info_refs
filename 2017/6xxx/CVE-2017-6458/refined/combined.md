SSA-211752: Multiple NTP-Client Related Vulnerabilities in SIMATIC
CP 443-1 OPC UA

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2021-06-08
2022-02-08
V1.1

SUMMARY

All versions of the SIMATIC CP 443-1 OPC UA contain multiple vulnerabilities in the underlying third party
component NTP.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SIMATIC CP 443-1 OPC UA (6GK7443-1UX00-
0XE0):
All versions

Currently no remediation is planned
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by

default

• Conﬁgure an additional ﬁrewall to prevent communication to port udp/123 of an affected device

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

SSA-211752

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-7705

The rate limiting feature in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.x before 4.3.77 allows remote attackers to
have unspeciﬁed impact via a large number of crafted requests.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-7853

The datalen parameter in the refclock driver in NTP 4.2.x before 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.x before 4.3.77
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (crash) via a negative

Vulnerability CVE-2016-1548

An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the
peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and
earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate
server responses.
It is possible to force the victim client to move time after the mode has been
changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched.

#### Description

`ntpd` makes use of different wrappers around `ctl_putdata()` to create name/value `ntpq` (mode 6) response strings. For example, `ctl_putstr()` is usually used to send string data (variable names or string data). The formatting code was missing a length check for variable names. If somebody explicitly created any unusually long variable names in `ntpd` (longer than 200-512 bytes, depending on the type of variable), then if any of these variables are added to the response list it would overflow a buffer.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page)
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p10 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)
* If you don’t want to upgrade, then don’t `setvar` variable names longer than 200-512 bytes in your `ntp.conf` file.
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances, and auto-restart `ntpd` (without `-g`) if it stops running.

This weakness was discovered by Cure53.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1434011#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-20 14:29:53 UTC  ``` The legacy MX4200 refclock is only built if it is specifically enabled, and furthermore additional code changes are required to compile and use it. But it uses the libc functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() incorrectly, which can lead to an out-of-bounds memory write due to an improper handling of the return value of snprintf()/vsnprintf(). Since the return value is used as an iterator and it can be larger than the buffer's size, it is possible for the iterator to point somewhere outside of the allocated buffer space.  This results in an out-of-bound memory write. This behavior can be leveraged to overwrite a saved instruction pointer on the stack and gain control over the execution flow.  During testing it was not possible to identify any malicious usage for this vulnerability. Specifically, no way for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability was ultimately unveiled. However, it has the potential to be exploited, so the code should be fixed.  Mitigation:  Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1434011#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-20 14:29:58 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the NTP project Upstream: Cure53   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1434011#c2)  Doran Moppert    2017-03-21 06:06:38 UTC  ``` NTP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 through 7 is built with the MX4200 refclock disabled.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1434011#c4)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-23 10:08:50 UTC  ``` Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1435163](show_bug.cgi?id=1435163 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-6464 CVE-2017-6462 CVE-2017-6463 CVE-2017-6458 CVE-2017-6451 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

ICS Advisory
# Siemens SIMATIC NET CP 443-1 OPC UA

Last RevisedJune 08, 2021
Alert CodeICSA-21-159-11

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor:** Siemens
* **Equipment:** SIMATIC NET CP 443-1 OPC UA
* **Vulnerabilities:** Improper Input Validation, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Incorrect Calculation, Classic Buffer Overflow, Improper Authentication, Race Condition, Data Processing Errors, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Out-of-bounds Read

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could create a denial-of-service condition as well as other specified and unspecified impacts.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of SIMATIC NET CP 443-1 OPC UA are affected:

* SIMATIC NET CP 443-1 OPC UA: All versions

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the origin timestamp check functionality of ntpd 4.2.8p9. A specially crafted, unauthenticated network packet can be used to reset the expected origin timestamp for target peers. Legitimate replies from targeted peers will fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2), causing the reply to be dropped and creating a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2016-9042](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-9042) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

Multiple buffer overflows in the ctl\_put\* functions in NTP before 4.2.8p10 and 4.3.x before 4.3.94 allow remote authenticated users to have unspecified impact via a long variable.

[CVE-2017-6458](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6548) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

NTP before 4.2.8p9 allows remote attackers to bypass the origin timestamp protection mechanism via an origin timestamp of zero. Note: this vulnerability exists due to a CVE-2015-8138 regression.

[CVE-2016-7431](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-7431) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)).

#### 3.2.4    [INCORRECT CALCULATION CWE-682](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/682.html)

NTP before 4.2.8p9 does not properly perform the initial sync calculations, which allows remote attackers to unspecified impact via unknown vectors related to a “root distance that did not include the peer dispersion.”

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple Sectors
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by default.
* Configure an additional firewall to prevent communication to Port UDP/123 of an affected device.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf), and follow the recommendations in the product manual.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information about this issue, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA-211752](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-211752.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3379#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2017-02-11 05:30:30 UTC   [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3379#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2017-02-11 05:33:36 UTC  ``` For the purpose of formatting different kinds of response strings into each response packet, Ntpd makes use of different wrappers around ctl_putdata(). For example, ctl_putstr() is often used to send quoted system variables, while ctl_putuint() comes into the fore when integer responses are being handled. All of these wrappers, however, suffer from stack based buffer overflow vulnerabilities as soon as they are utilized incorrectly. This is due to the fact that the length of the source variable is used on each occasion when the data is being copied into a local buffer. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3379#c2)  Juergen Perlinger    2017-02-12 07:05:07 UTC  ``` The repo is in   psp.ntp.org:~perlinger/ntp-stable-3379 ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3379#c3)  Harlan Stenn    2017-03-01 06:55:12 UTC  ``` STAGED for ntp-4.2.8p10 ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3379#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2017-03-22 00:04:12 UTC  ``` Here's a better summary:  ntpd makes use of different wrappers around ctl_putdata() to create name/value ntpq (mode 6) response strings. For example, ctl_putstr() is usually used to send string data (variable names or string data). The formatting code was missing a length check for variable names. If somebody explicitly created any unusually long variable names in ntpd (longer than 200-512 bytes, depending on the type of variable), then if any of these variables are added to the response list it would overflow a buffer.  Pearly, thanks for your work on this. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3379#c5)  Miroslav Lichvar    2017-03-23 09:32:34 UTC  ``` I was looking at the patch that was included to fix this issue and I was wondering if ctl_putstr() should really assert that the data fit in the buffer. Some system variables can be changed by the user (e.g. host and cert with autokey) and could theoretically be larger than the buffer. Before this change, the string was silently truncated, but now ntpd will crash due to the assertion. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=3379#c6)  Miroslav Lichvar    2017-03-23 10:39:25 UTC  ``` Actually, this seems to be a separate issue I hit while backporting the patch for 4.2.6p5. It's only in older versions before 4.2.7p22 where ctl_putstr() silently truncated the data string. I'll file a new bug. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1434005#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-20 14:15:30 UTC  ``` ntpd makes use of different wrappers around ctl_putdata() to create name/value ntpq (mode 6) response strings. For example, ctl_putstr() is usually used to send string data (variable names or string data).  The formatting code was missing a length check for variable names. If somebody explicitly created any unusually long variable names in ntpd (longer than 200-512 bytes, depending on the type of variable), then if any of these variables are added to the response list it would overflow a buffer.  Mitigation:  Implement BCP-38.  If you don't want to upgrade, then don't setvar variable names longer than 200-512 bytes in your ntp.conf file.  Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1434005#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-20 14:15:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the NTP project Upstream: Cure53   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1434005#c5)  Adam Mariš    2017-03-23 10:08:41 UTC  ``` Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1435163](show_bug.cgi?id=1435163 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-6464 CVE-2017-6462 CVE-2017-6463 CVE-2017-6458 CVE-2017-6451 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1434005#c7)  Doran Moppert    2017-03-30 05:59:42 UTC  ``` Statement:  The security assessment from cure53 clarifies that this issue (identified as NTP-01-0004) is not a vulnerability per se, but a weakness in ntp's internal coding style that may cause a vulnerability if particularly long variable names are defined at compile time. No such variable names are defined in upstream source code, nor in Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions of ntp.   ``` |  |

Version : 4.2.8p10
Release : 1.fc26
URL : <http://www.ntp.org>
Summary : The NTP daemon and utilities
Description :
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with another reference time source. This package includes ntpd
(a daemon which continuously adjusts system time) and utilities used
to query and configure the ntpd daemon.

Perl scripts are in the ntp-perl package, ntpdate is in the ntpdate
package and sntp is in the sntp package. The documentation in HTML

CVE-2017-6451 CVE-2017-6460 CVE-2016-9042. ---- This update improves the
default configuration file to use the pool directive. It also replaces the
ntpstat program with a shell script that uses the ntpq program instead of
implementing the mode 6 protocol.
