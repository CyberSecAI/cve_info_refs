Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `SymDiag.exe` executable of the Gemalto SmartDiag Diagnosis Tool when registering a new card. Specifically, the input fields related to the ATR (Answer To Reset) are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Stack-based buffer overflow**: The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling user-supplied input into the ATR input fields of the "Register a new card" functionality.
    *  **SEH overwrite**: The buffer overflow allows overwriting the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) on the stack.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   **Code execution**: By overwriting the SEH, an attacker can gain control of the program execution flow.
    *   **Command execution**: The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) shows that shellcode can be executed, allowing arbitrary command execution on the target system.
    *   **Backdoor creation**: The PoC specifically establishes a backdoor, indicating a significant level of control an attacker can achieve.

*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **Local attack**: This is a local attack that requires the attacker to have access to the machine where the vulnerable software is running.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   **Local access**: The attacker needs local access to the machine with the vulnerable Gemalto SmartDiag Diagnosis Tool installed.
    *   **User interaction**: The attacker needs to interact with the application, specifically by using the "Register a new card" function and entering crafted input to the ATR field.

**Additional Information**:

*   The exploit is specific to the Windows platform, and the provided PoC was tested on Windows 7 x64 and Windows 8 x64 running SmartDiag v2.5.
*   The exploit uses a long, repeating pattern ("52834000") to cause the overflow and overwrite the SEH, followed by shellcode.
*   The vendor was notified of the vulnerability but a fix was not available at the time of the exploit's publication.
