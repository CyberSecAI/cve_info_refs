Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6508:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `url_parse` function within `src/url.c` of GNU Wget. Specifically, the host subcomponent of a URL was not checked for control characters (CRLF sequences).
*   Wget was using `urlencode` to encode CRLF in the PATH part of a URL, but not in the HOST part

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CRLF Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a CRLF (carriage return and line feed) injection vulnerability.  By inserting CRLF sequences (%0d%0a) within the host part of a URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTTP Header Injection:**  A remote attacker can inject any HTTP headers they choose. This could be used for various attacks:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Injecting a `Cookie` header to steal or manipulate session cookies.
    *   **Cache poisoning:** Injecting headers to manipulate how the response is cached by intermediate proxies.
    *   **Bypass security checks:** Injecting headers to bypass access controls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URLs:** Attackers create specially crafted URLs containing CRLF sequences within the host portion.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user uses Wget to process these crafted URLs. This often involves tricking the user into using Wget on the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a remote location, needing only to craft a malicious URL.
*   **User interaction/social engineering:** The attacker relies on a user running Wget to process the specially crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided email from Orange Tsai demonstrates the vulnerability, showing how injecting CRLF sequences into the host part leads to arbitrary HTTP header insertion. The provided example highlights the difference between the path and host parts and how they are handled by Wget.
*   The patch introduced in the provided git commit rejects control characters in the host part of the URL.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201706-16) confirms the vulnerability, the affected versions, and provides the resolution by updating to the patched version.
