Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Cisco Virtual Network Function (VNF) Element Manager due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-78 (OS Command Injection):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated remote attacker can elevate their privileges to run commands as the *root* user on the affected server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Execution of arbitrary commands as *root* could lead to complete system compromise, allowing an attacker to perform unauthorized actions, potentially impacting confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate to the VNF Element Manager before exploiting the command execution vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cisco VNF Element Manager.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable VNF Element Manager over the network.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-6710 is an OS command injection vulnerability in the Cisco Virtual Network Function (VNF) Element Manager. It allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root, leading to potential complete system compromise. The attack vector is network based and requires an authenticated user.
