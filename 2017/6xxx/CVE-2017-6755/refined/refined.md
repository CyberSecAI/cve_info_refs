Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the web portal of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP) Tool. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary script code in the context of a user's browser session when they interact with the vulnerable web interface. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Stealing sensitive information like cookies and session tokens.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user within the affected application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An unauthenticated attacker can remotely exploit this vulnerability. The attacker requires the user to interact with a crafted link or webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any privileges to carry out the attack (PR:N).
*   The attacker must trick a user into interacting with the malicious payload (UI:R)

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects all releases of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Tool that are in the default configuration.
* The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 6.1, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
*  The scope (S) is changed to 'C' indicating a change in authority that allows the attacker to affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.
*  The confidentiality and integrity impacts are low (C:L/I:L), while availability is not impacted (A:N).
*  There are no workarounds available, users need to upgrade to a fixed version of the software.
