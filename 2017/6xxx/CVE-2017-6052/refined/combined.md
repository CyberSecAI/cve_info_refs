# R7-2017-02: Hyundai Blue Link Potential Info Disclosure (FIXED)

* Apr 25, 2017
* 3 min read
* [Tod Beardsley](/blog/author/tod-beardsley/)

*Last updated at Tue, 09 May 2023 18:20:46 GMT*

## Summary

Due to a reliance on cleartext communications and the use of a hard-coded decryption password, two outdated versions of Hyundai Blue Link application software, 3.9.4 and 3.9.5 potentially expose sensitive information about registered users and their vehicles, including application usernames, passwords, and PINs via a log transmission feature. This feature was introduced in version 3.9.4 on December 8, 2016, and removed by Hyundai on March 6, 2017 with the release of version 3.9.6.

Affected versions of Hyundai Blue Link mobile application upload application logs to a static IP address over HTTP on port 8080. The log is encrypted using a symmetrical key, "1986l12Ov09e", which is defined in the Blue Link application (specifically, C1951e.java), and cannot be modified by the user.

Once decoded, the logs contain personal information, including the user's username, password, PIN, and historical GPS data about the vehicle's location. This information can be used to remotely locate, unlock and start the associated vehicle.

This vulnerability was discovered by Will Hatzer and Arjun Kumar, and this advisory was prepared in accordance with Rapid7's disclosure policy.

## Product Description

The Blue Link app is compatible with 2012 and newer Hyundai vehicles. The functionality includes remote start, location services, unlocking and locking associated automobiles, and other features, documented at the vendor's [web site](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/bluelink/index.aspx).

## Credit

This vulnerability was discovered by independent researchers William Hatzer and Arjun Kumar.

## Exploitation for R7-2017-02

The potential data exposure can be exploited one user at a time via passive listening on insecure WiFi, or by standard  [man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/man-in-the-middle-attacks/) methods to trick a user into connecting to a WiFi network controlled by an attacker on the same network as the user. If this is achieved, an attacker would then watch for HTTP traffic directed at an HTTP site at 54.xx.yy.113:8080/LogManager/LogServlet, which includes the encrypted log file with a filename that includes the user's email address.

It would be difficult to impossible to conduct this attack at scale, since an attacker would typically need to first subvert physically local networks, or gain a privileged position on the network path from the app user to the vendor's service instance.

## Vendor Statement

Hyundai Motor America (HMA) was made aware of a vulnerability in the Hyundai Blue Link mobile application by researchers at Rapid7. Upon learning of this vulnerability, HMA launched an investigation to validate the research and took immediate steps to further secure the application. HMA is not aware of any customers being impacted by this potential vulnerability.

The privacy and security of our customers is of the utmost importance to HMA. HMA continuously seeks to improve its mobile application and system security. As a member of the Automotive Information Sharing Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC), HMA values security information sharing and thanks Rapid7 for its report.

## Remediation

On March 6, 2017, the vendor updated the Hyundai Blue Link app to version 3.9.6, which removes the LogManager log transmission feature. In addition, the TCP service at 54.xx.yy.113:8000 has been disabled. The mandatory update to version 3.9.6 is available in both the standard Android and Apple app stores.

ICS Advisory
# Hyundai Motor America Blue Link

Last RevisedApril 25, 2017
Alert CodeICSA-17-115-03

### **CVSS v3 7.5**

**ATTENTION:** Remotely exploitable

**Vendor:** Hyundai Motor America

**Equipment:** Blue Link

**Vulnerability:** Man-in-the-Middle, Use of Hard-Coded Cryptographic Key

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Blue Link, a mobile application for Hyundai vehicle management, are affected:

* Blue Link Version 3.9.5, and
* Blue Link Version 3.9.4.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to gain access to insecurely transmitted sensitive information, which could allow the attacker to locate, unlock, and start a vehicle associated with the affected application.

Rapid7 working with Hyundai Motor America reports that it would be difficult to impossible to conduct this attack at scale, since an attacker would typically need to first subvert physically local networks, or gain a privileged position on the network path from the app user to their service instance.

## MITIGATION

Hyundai Motor America released Blue Link, Version 3.9.6, a mandatory update to the application, which mitigates the aforementioned vulnerabilities on March 6, 2017, for Android devices and March 8, 2017, for iOS devices.

Rapid7 has released a security advisory that can be found at <https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2017/04/25/r7-2017-02-hyundai-blue-link-potential-info-disclosure-fixed>

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

# R7-2017-02: Hyundai Blue Link Potential Info Disclosure (FIXED)

* Apr 25, 2017
* 3 min read
* [Tod Beardsley](/blog/author/tod-beardsley/)

*Last updated at Tue, 09 May 2023 18:20:46 GMT*

## Summary

Due to a reliance on cleartext communications and the use of a hard-coded decryption password, two outdated versions of Hyundai Blue Link application software, 3.9.4 and 3.9.5 potentially expose sensitive information about registered users and their vehicles, including application usernames, passwords, and PINs via a log transmission feature. This feature was introduced in version 3.9.4 on December 8, 2016, and removed by Hyundai on March 6, 2017 with the release of version 3.9.6.

Affected versions of Hyundai Blue Link mobile application upload application logs to a static IP address over HTTP on port 8080. The log is encrypted using a symmetrical key, "1986l12Ov09e", which is defined in the Blue Link application (specifically, C1951e.java), and cannot be modified by the user.

Once decoded, the logs contain personal information, including the user's username, password, PIN, and historical GPS data about the vehicle's location. This information can be used to remotely locate, unlock and start the associated vehicle.

This vulnerability was discovered by Will Hatzer and Arjun Kumar, and this advisory was prepared in accordance with Rapid7's disclosure policy.

## Product Description

The Blue Link app is compatible with 2012 and newer Hyundai vehicles. The functionality includes remote start, location services, unlocking and locking associated automobiles, and other features, documented at the vendor's [web site](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/bluelink/index.aspx).

## Credit

This vulnerability was discovered by independent researchers William Hatzer and Arjun Kumar.

## Exploitation for R7-2017-02

The potential data exposure can be exploited one user at a time via passive listening on insecure WiFi, or by standard  [man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack](https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/man-in-the-middle-attacks/) methods to trick a user into connecting to a WiFi network controlled by an attacker on the same network as the user. If this is achieved, an attacker would then watch for HTTP traffic directed at an HTTP site at 54.xx.yy.113:8080/LogManager/LogServlet, which includes the encrypted log file with a filename that includes the user's email address.

It would be difficult to impossible to conduct this attack at scale, since an attacker would typically need to first subvert physically local networks, or gain a privileged position on the network path from the app user to the vendor's service instance.

## Vendor Statement

Hyundai Motor America (HMA) was made aware of a vulnerability in the Hyundai Blue Link mobile application by researchers at Rapid7. Upon learning of this vulnerability, HMA launched an investigation to validate the research and took immediate steps to further secure the application. HMA is not aware of any customers being impacted by this potential vulnerability.

The privacy and security of our customers is of the utmost importance to HMA. HMA continuously seeks to improve its mobile application and system security. As a member of the Automotive Information Sharing Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC), HMA values security information sharing and thanks Rapid7 for its report.

## Remediation

On March 6, 2017, the vendor updated the Hyundai Blue Link app to version 3.9.6, which removes the LogManager log transmission feature. In addition, the TCP service at 54.xx.yy.113:8000 has been disabled. The mandatory update to version 3.9.6 is available in both the standard Android and Apple app stores.
