Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from two main issues: reliance on cleartext communication and the use of a hard-coded decryption key within the Hyundai Blue Link mobile application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Cleartext Communication:** The affected versions of the Hyundai Blue Link app transmit logs over HTTP (port 8080), without encryption, making the traffic susceptible to eavesdropping.
2. **Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The application uses a static, hard-coded symmetric key ("1986l12Ov09e") to encrypt the logs. This key is embedded within the application's code (specifically C1951e.java) and is therefore easily discoverable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to intercept and decrypt the logs, potentially exposing:
- Usernames and passwords
- PINs
- Historical GPS data of the vehicle
This information could be used to remotely locate, unlock, and start the associated vehicle.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:
1. **Passive Listening:** An attacker passively monitors network traffic on an insecure Wi-Fi network.
2. **Active MitM:** An attacker tricks the user into connecting to a Wi-Fi network controlled by the attacker.
In either case, the attacker intercepts HTTP traffic directed towards the log server and captures the encrypted logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the victim, or in a privileged position on the network path from the app user to the vendor's service instance.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept and capture network traffic on an insecure network and then has to be able to decrypt the captured traffic using the hard-coded key.

**Additional Details:**
- The log transmission feature was introduced in version 3.9.4 and removed in version 3.9.6.
- The affected versions are 3.9.4 and 3.9.5 of the Hyundai Blue Link app.
- The vulnerability was addressed by Hyundai with the release of version 3.9.6, which removed the log transmission feature and disabled the TCP service at the vulnerable port.
- It is noted that conducting this attack at scale is difficult.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2017-6052 (Man-in-the-Middle) and CVE-2017-6054 (Hard-coded key).
