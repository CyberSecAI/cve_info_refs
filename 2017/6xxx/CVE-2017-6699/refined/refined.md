Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the user's browser. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute within the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit the manipulated URL. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies or session tokens
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim
    - Redirect the user to a malicious website
    - Deface the web page

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload
- The victim user clicks the malicious URL

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on it.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
