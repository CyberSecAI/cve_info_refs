Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2017-6895 vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6895
*   **Affected Product:** USB Pratirodh
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's insecure parsing of XML input, specifically through the use of an improperly configured XML parser, which is susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the application's vulnerability to XML External Entity (XXE) injection (CWE-611). This means the application processes XML from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to insert malicious XML code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information residing on the server where the XML parser is running.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, an attacker could induce a denial-of-service condition, disrupting normal application operation.
    *  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could manipulate the server to make requests to other servers, possibly internal resources.
     *   **Port Scanning:** Attackers can perform port scans from the perspective of the machine running the vulnerable parser.
    *   **Other System Impacts:**  The exploit can potentially lead to other system-level impacts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious XML code into the application's XML parser. This would likely involve manipulating a `usb.xml` file that the application processes.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject crafted XML into the application. This could potentially be achieved through:
    * Modifying the `usb.xml` file if the attacker has access.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how an attacker can inject an external entity by adding the following to the `usb.xml` file:
    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
     <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
     <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://tigerboy.com/XXE">
    ]>
    <foo>&xxe;</foo>
    ```
    This code snippet attempts to make the vulnerable application retrieve content from the attacker-controlled server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Sachin Wagh (@tiger\_tigerboy).
*   The affected product, USB Pratirodh, is a USB mass storage device control solution developed by C-DAC.
