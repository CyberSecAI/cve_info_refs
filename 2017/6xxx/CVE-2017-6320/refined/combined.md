##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

[What's New in the Barracuda Load Balancer ADC](/product/loadbalanceradc/doc/172359752/what-s-new-in-the-barracuda-load-balancer-adc/)  [Overview](/product/loadbalanceradc/doc/172359688/overview/)

# Release Notes Version 6.1.0.003

* Last updated on 2024-05-13 07:32:26

Before installing any firmware version, back up your configuration and read all release notes that apply to versions more recent than the one currently running on your system.

**Do not manually reboot your system at any time during an update unless otherwise instructed by Barracuda Networks Technical Support.** Depending on your current firmware version and other system factors, updating can take up to 10 minutes. If the process takes longer, contact Barracuda Networks Technical Support for further assistance.

### Features

* Support has been added for the HTTP/2 protocol over HTTPS. [BNADC-7208]

### Enhancements

* High Availability now supports automatic failover in case a critical process fails on an active device. [BNADC-1485]
* Server health checks now support HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. [BNADC-5632]
* The internal platform utilities and kernel have been upgraded. [BNADC-6461]
* LDAP nested groups across different domains are now supported. [BNADC-7595]
* The FTP access log can now be exported instantly. [BNADC-8408]

### Fixes

* Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) can now process traffic without interruption. [BNADC-7021]
* The serial number of the clustered peer Barracuda Load Balancer ADC is now displayed on the **ADVANCED > High Availability** page in the **Clustered System** section. [BNADC-7101]
* Both units in a high availability cluster are in the active state. This has been addressed. [BNADC-7134]
* You can now specify the maximum number of times a user can attempt to authenticate. [BNADC-7392]
* When starting Instant SSL with an existing HTTP service, there are duplicate database variables. This has been addressed. [BNADC-7471]
* A report is now sent when an SMTP server is configured with a username and password. [BNADC-7866]
* A character is being removed while completing a SharePoint rewrite. This has been addressed. [BNADC-7933]
* Dual Authentication is now supported with LDAP as the primary authentication service and Radius as the secondary authentication service. [BNADC-8022]
* The initial characters of a certificate name can now include numbers. [BNADC-8137]
* If you set **Enable High Availability** to **Yes**, the default value for **Failback Mode** is now set to **Manual**. [BNADC-8155]
* Changing the service type from INSTANT SSL to HTTP/HTTPS and then back to INSTANT SSL now correctly creates the Redirect service. [BNADC-8422]
* After upgrading the firmware, the system failed to reboot due to a networking issue. This has been addressed. [BNADC-8449]
* If the LDAP authentication service's default role is changed by the administrator in the **ADVANCED > Admin Access Control** page, the role of LDAP mapped users is not changed. [BNADC-8453]
* The domain name can now be sent along with the username to the Radius server for user authentication. [BNADC-8598]
