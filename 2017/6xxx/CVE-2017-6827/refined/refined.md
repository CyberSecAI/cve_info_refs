Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6827

**Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `MSADPCM::initializeCoefficients` function within the `audiofile` library.

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability occurs due to a buffer overflow in heap memory when processing malformed audio files. Specifically, the `memcpy` operation within `MSADPCM::initializeCoefficients` attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting the heap overflow could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Malicious Audio File:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user processes a specially crafted WAV file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to provide a malicious audio file to the vulnerable application.
*  No specific user privileges needed.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with a WAV file as input.
*   The affected function is in `MSADPCM.cpp`, specifically line 369.
*   The overflow happens when `memcpy` is used to write data of size 33872 at address `0x61a00001f708` while the allocated buffer size is only 1160 bytes.
*   The vulnerable version is 0.3.6, and the fix was released in version 0.3.6-2+deb8u2 for Debian stable (jessie) and 0.3.6-4 for Debian unstable (sid) and upcoming stable (stretch).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
