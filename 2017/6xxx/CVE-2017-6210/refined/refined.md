Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-6210:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `vrend_decode_reset` function of virglrenderer.
- Specifically, it's a null pointer dereference that can occur when destroying renderer context zero (0). Context 0 is allocated during renderer initialization and not intended to be destroyed via the standard `vrend_renderer_context_destroy` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a pointer that can be null when context 0 is destroyed via the `vrend_renderer_context_destroy` function, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user/process can exploit this vulnerability to crash the QEMU process instance, resulting in a denial of service on the host system running QEMU.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Guest OS Access:** The attack vector is a guest user or process running within a virtualized environment using QEMU with virglrenderer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the virglrenderer functionality of the virtualized environment.
- This typically implies the attacker has control over a process within the guest OS that can trigger the destruction of context 0 in virglrenderer.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The issue was reported by Li Qiang from 360.cn Inc.
- The upstream patch to address this vulnerability is located at: `https://cgit.freedesktop.org/virglrenderer/commit/?id=0a5dff15912207b83018485f83e067474e818bab`.
- The patch modifies `src/vrend_decode.c` to prevent destruction of context 0 in `vrend_renderer_context_destroy`.
- Virglrenderer version 0.6.0 includes the fix for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "normal" severity by Gentoo.
