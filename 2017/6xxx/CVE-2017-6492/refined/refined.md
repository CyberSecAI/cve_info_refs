Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Affected Software:** Admidio 3.2.5

**Root Cause:** The content directly states "SQL injection Proof of Concept for Admidio 3.2.5", indicating a SQL injection vulnerability. While the exact vulnerable code is not provided here, the existence of the PoC suggests improper sanitization or handling of user-supplied input within SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The content does not specify the exact impact, but SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
    - Potentially gain administrative control of the application if the database user has sufficient privileges.
    - In some cases, achieve remote code execution on the server if the database user has filesystem access via stored procedures.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through manipulating user input that is subsequently used in SQL queries without proper sanitization. The specific entry points are not detailed here.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to send crafted SQL queries or input to the Admidio application. The content does not provide additional context on the specific required capabilities or position.

**Additional Notes:**
- The repository contains a PDF "Admidio 3.2.5 SQLi PoC.pdf" which likely contains the detailed steps to exploit the vulnerability.
- The repository is named "Admidio-SQL-Injection-Vulnerability", which further confirms the existence of such a vulnerability.
