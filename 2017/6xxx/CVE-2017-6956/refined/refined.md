{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of TDLS (Tunneled Direct Link Setup) frames, specifically during the MIC (Message Integrity Code) calculation for both setup and teardown phases. During setup, the code copies data into a fixed-size buffer, but fails to properly validate the length of subsequent Information Elements (IEs), leading to an out-of-bounds write. During teardown, the length of the Fast Transition IE is not verified, causing a similar buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking during data copying for MIC calculation in both setup and teardown phases of TDLS.",
       "Lack of stack cookies."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the Wi-Fi SoC. By exploiting the heap overflow, an attacker can corrupt heap metadata, overwrite function pointers (specifically timer callbacks), and gain control of the execution flow of the chip's firmware.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending crafted Wi-Fi management frames (TDLS frames), specifically, a crafted TDLS Setup Confirm (PMK M3) frame for setup overflow and TDLS Teardown frame for teardown overflow. These frames can be sent by any peer on the same Wi-Fi network. The attacker does not need to have an established connection with the target.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send arbitrary Wi-Fi frames to the vulnerable device, and have knowledge of the required parameters to form a valid TDLS frame. The attacker must also have a means to analyze and debug the state of the heap on the target device to properly construct the exploit."
