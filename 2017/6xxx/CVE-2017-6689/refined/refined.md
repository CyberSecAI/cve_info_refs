Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure default administrator credentials within the ConfD CLI of Cisco Elastic Services Controllers (ESC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-255:**  The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-255, which refers to the use of hard-coded credentials, a common security weakness. Specifically, the Cisco ESC uses a default username and password for the *admin* user, which allows attackers to easily gain access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain unauthorized access to the affected Cisco ESC as the *admin* user.
*   The impact includes potential compromise of the system, unauthorized configuration changes, data breaches, etc., given the access level gained.
* The CVSS score indicates a medium level of risk with low impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   The attack requires an attacker that can access the Cisco Elastic Services Controllers (ESC) on its network interfaces.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Remote Access:** An attacker needs to have authenticated, remote network access to the vulnerable Cisco ESC in order to exploit this vulnerability. The required privileges are "low" (PR:L), implying a lower privileged account can be used to exploit the default credentials vulnerability, or an attacker with access to the insecure credentials can leverage the account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions that there are no known workarounds available.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 6.3, indicating a medium severity.
*   Cisco has released fixed software to address the issue.
*   The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time the advisory was released.
