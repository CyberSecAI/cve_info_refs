Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6965:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `readelf` utility, specifically within the `elfcomm.c` file when handling target-specific relocations. The code processing these relocations did not properly check for potential buffer overflows before writing relocated values. This allowed writing past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap buffer overflow:**  The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking in the `target_specific_reloc_handling` function when processing relocations. This allows writing outside of allocated memory.
*   **Incorrect relocation handling:** The vulnerability exists specifically when processing corrupt input files containing symbol-difference relocations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can trigger the heap buffer overflow by enticing a user to compile/execute or analyze a specially crafted ELF file. This leads to a crash or other unpredictable behavior, effectively causing a denial of service. This is more detailed than the official CVE description.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in this report, heap overflows can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution in some cases.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted ELF file:** The primary attack vector involves providing a malformed ELF file to the `readelf` utility.
*   **Remote attack:** The advisory suggests a remote attacker can entice a user to analyze a malicious file, indicating a remote attack scenario is possible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious ELF files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted ELF file containing symbol-difference relocations designed to trigger the overflow during processing.
*   **Ability to entice a user to execute `readelf`:** The attacker needs to trick a user into running the vulnerable `readelf` utility on the crafted malicious ELF file.

**Additional notes**
* The vulnerability was found using AFLGo, a directed version of the AFL fuzzer.
* The bug report includes a patch addressing the buffer overflow and also specifies that this bug has multiple duplicates.
