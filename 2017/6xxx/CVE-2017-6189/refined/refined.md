Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Amazon Kindle for Windows application is susceptible to a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application loads DLL files from insecure locations, specifically the "Downloads" directory, without proper verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When the Kindle installer ("Kindle Setup") is executed from a location such as the "Downloads" folder, it can load and execute a malicious DLL file placed in the same directory.
- This could allow an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution within the context of the Kindle installer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the Kindle installer.
- The user must then execute the Kindle installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write files to a location where a user will execute the Kindle installer (such as the user's Downloads directory) .
- The attacker must create a malicious DLL file that will be executed by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Kindle version 1.19.
- This vulnerability is specific to the Windows version of the Amazon Kindle application.
