- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Livebox router has a default IPv6 routing table with a maximum size that is too small. This allows an attacker to fill the table, causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow caused by the router's IPv6 routing table being too small.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of the vulnerability renders the affected system unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service condition for phone, internet, and TV services.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by sending IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) packets with a large number of prefix options. This fills up the router's routing table, leading to a denial of service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the local network to send the crafted IPv6 packets.
