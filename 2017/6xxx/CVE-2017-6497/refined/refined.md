Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-6497:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A missing null pointer check in the PSD (Photoshop Document) coder of ImageMagick. Specifically, the `ReadPSDChannel` function does not check if `CloneImage` returns a valid pointer before dereferencing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** If `CloneImage` fails to allocate memory and returns NULL, the code proceeds to use the returned NULL pointer resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted PSD file can trigger the NULL pointer dereference, causing the ImageMagick application to crash, effectively resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick processes a maliciously crafted PSD file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PSD file to ImageMagick for processing. This could be through a web application, email attachment, or any other means where ImageMagick is used to process user-provided images.
- No special privileges or network access is needed, just ability to pass a malicious file to an affected ImageMagick instance.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix was to add a null check after `CloneImage` to ensure a valid pointer before dereferencing, as seen in the provided github commit.
- The vulnerability was present in ImageMagick version 6.9.7 and fixed in 6.9.7.4+dfsg-2.
