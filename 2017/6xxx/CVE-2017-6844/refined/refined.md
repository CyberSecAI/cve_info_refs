{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `PoDoFo::PdfParser::ReadXRefSubsection` function, which occurs when resizing a vector of `PoDoFo::PdfParser::TXRefEntry` objects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Global buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution. The overflow overwrites the memory adjacent to the global variable `PoDoFo::PODOFO_BUILTIN_FONTS`.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PDF file with podofo library. The specific vector is through the `PoDoFo::PdfParser::ReadXRefSubsection` function when reading cross-reference table subsections.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file that exploits the overflow in the cross-reference table parsing logic. The attacker needs to have the ability to get the vulnerable program to parse this malicious pdf file."
