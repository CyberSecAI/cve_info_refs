renderer: fix memory leak in vertex elements state createReported-by: Li Qiang
Free the vertex array in error path.
This was introduced by this commit:
renderer: fix heap overflow in vertex elements state create.
I rewrote the code to not require the allocation in the first
place if we have an error, seems nicer.

# virglrenderer: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201707-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in virglrenderer, the
worst of which could allow local guest OS users to cause a Denial of
Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/virglrenderer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.6.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.6.0** |

### Background

A virtual 3D GPU library, that allows the guest operating system to use
the host GPU to accelerate 3D rendering.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in virglrenderer. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Subject: CVE-2017-6386 Virglrenderer: memory leakage while in
 vrend_create_vertex_elements_state

   Hello,

Virgil 3d project, used by Quick Emulator(Qemu) to implement 3D GPU support
for the virtio GPU, is vulnerable to memory leakage issue. It could occur when
a guest tries to create vertex elements via 'VIRGL_OBJECT_VERTEX_ELEMENTS'
command.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://cgit.freedesktop.org/virglrenderer/commit/?id=737c3350850ca4dbc5633b3bdb4118176ce59920>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427472>

This issue was reported by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.

'CVE-2017-6386' assigned via -> <http://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.
