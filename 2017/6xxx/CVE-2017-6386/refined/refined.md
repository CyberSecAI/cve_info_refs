Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6386:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the `vrend_create_vertex_elements_state` function of virglrenderer.
- The leak occurs when an error happens during the creation of vertex elements, specifically when the allocation of `vrend_vertex_element_array` fails. In this case, the allocated `vrend_vertex_element_array` is not freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A guest user/process can repeatedly trigger the memory leak in the host, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the host machine.
- The attacker can exhaust the host's memory by creating vertex elements via the `VIRGL_OBJECT_VERTEX_ELEMENTS` command.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious guest operating system user/process can trigger the vulnerability.
- Specifically, by sending the `VIRGL_OBJECT_VERTEX_ELEMENTS` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user/process within the guest OS that utilizes the virglrenderer library for 3D rendering.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create vertex elements via the virgl interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in a previous commit that addressed a heap overflow issue in the same function.
- A patch has been released to fix the issue.
- The fix involves not allocating memory in the first place if an error occurs during the creation of vertex elements, preventing the leak.
