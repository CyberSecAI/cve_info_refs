Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `decodeSample` function within the `IMA.cpp` file of the audiofile library.
- The overflow occurs due to an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `indexTable` global variable. The index value used to access the table is not properly validated, which can lead to accessing memory outside of the table's bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Global buffer overflow: Reading data beyond the allocated memory of a global variable.
- Insufficient input validation: The index used to access `indexTable` is not checked against the size of the table.
- Improper bounds checking: Lack of proper bounds checking in the `decodeSample` function when dealing with the index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The application crashes due to the buffer overflow as shown by the ASan output.
- Potential code execution: While not explicitly stated in the provided content, a global buffer overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited maliciously.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing malformed audio files: The vulnerability is triggered when the audiofile library processes a specially crafted audio file that contains specific parameters that leads to an out of bounds read when processing IMA encoded data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to supply malicious input to the audiofile library:  The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted audio file to the application using the vulnerable library. This can be achieved in a variety of ways, such as providing a file through a web server, file sharing, or email.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The affected version is audiofile 0.3.6.
- The fix involves clamping the index values to prevent them from overflowing, as shown in the commit diff provided by antlarr.
- The vulnerability is present in `decodeSample` function called by `IMA::decodeBlockWAVE` and `IMA::decodeBlockQT`.
- The vulnerable code reads 2 bytes from the memory location derived from the `indexTable` and the invalid index value.
- Debian has addressed this vulnerability in their security update DSA-3814-1.
