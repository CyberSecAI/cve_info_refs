Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in certain commands within the Cisco Elastic Services Controller. Specifically, the flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The core issue is the ability to execute commands that are not intended or authorized. This usually arises from improper input validation or insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data before it is used in system calls.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain *root* privileges. This means an attacker can perform any action on the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker with root access can perform any operation, including:
    -  Reading and modifying all files
    -  Installing malicious software
    -  Disrupting services
    -  Gaining access to other systems on the network

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is network exploitable (AV:N).
- **Authentication Required:**  The attacker must be authenticated as a low-privileged user to exploit the vulnerability (PR:L).
- **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be done without any user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to access the vulnerable commands in Cisco Elastic Services Controller.
-  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco Elastic Services Controller versions prior to 2.3.1.434 and 2.3.2 are affected.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 8.8, indicating a high severity.
- **CWE:** CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command)
- **No Workarounds:** Cisco states that there are no workarounds available other than upgrading to a fixed software version.

This analysis is based on the provided content and aligns with the official description of CVE-2017-6712, which involves arbitrary command execution due to insufficient input sanitization.
