# FileZilla: Buffer overflow — GLSA **201706-09**

A vulnerability in a bundled copy of PuTTY in FileZilla might allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/filezilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.25.2** |

### Background

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-agent-fwd-overflow.html

summary: Vulnerability: integer overflow permits memory overwrite by forwarded ssh-agent connections
class: vulnerability: This is a security vulnerability.
difficulty: fun: Just needs tuits, and not many of them.
priority: high: This should be fixed in the next release.
present-in: 0.67
fixed-in: 4ff22863d895cb7ebfced4cf923a012a614adaa8 (0.68)

Many versions of PuTTY prior to 0.68 have a heap-corrupting integer overflow bug in the ssh_agent_channel_data function which processes messages sent by remote SSH clients to a forwarded agent connection.

The agent protocol begins every message with a 32-bit length field, which gives the length of the remainder of the message, not including the length field itself. In order to accumulate the entire message including the length field in an internal buffer, PuTTY added 4 to the received length value, to obtain the message length inclusive of everything. This addition was unfortunately missing a check for unsigned integer overflow.

Hence, sending a length field large enough to overflow when 4 is added to it, such as 0xFFFFFFFD, would cause PuTTY to record a value for the total message length (totallen) which was smaller than the amount of data it had already seen (lensofar, which at this point would be 4 bytes for the length field itself). Then, it would assume that the expression totallen-lensofar represented the amount of space it was safe to write into its buffer – but in fact, in the overflowing case, this value would wrap back round to a number just less than 232, far larger than the allocated heap block, and PuTTY could be induced to overwrite its heap with data sent by the attacker.

If your server is running Linux or any reasonably similar Unix, and has the socat network utility installed, then you can use this simple proof of concept to determine whether you are affected. Simply run the shell command

(echo -ne '\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFD\x0B'; cat /dev/zero) | socat stdio unix-connect:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK

and PuTTY will crash.

This bug is only exploitable at all if you have enabled SSH agent forwarding, which is turned off by default. Moreover, an attacker able to exploit this bug would have to have already be able to connect to the Unix-domain socket representing the forwarded agent connection. Since any attacker with that capability would necessarily already be able to generate signatures with your agent's stored private keys, you should in normal circumstances be defended against this vulnerability by the same precautions you and your operating system were already taking to prevent untrusted people from accessing your SSH agent.

This vulnerability was reported by Tim Kosse, and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2017-6542.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# PuTTY: Buffer overflow — GLSA **201703-03**

A buffer overflow in PuTTY might allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/putty** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.68** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.68** |

### Background

PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Windows and Unix
platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator.

### Description

A heap-corrupting buffer overflow bug in the ssh\_agent\_channel\_data
function of PuTTY was found.

### Impact

A remote attacker, utilizing the SSH agent forwarding of an SSH server,
could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
client or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PuTTY users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/putty-0.68"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Garcia    2002-02-08 14:58:12 UTC  ``` i would recommend that you require imlib with icewm and add the --with-imlib to icewm configure it makes for a better icewm that supports more than just xpm ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-08 23:42:34 UTC  ``` OK, fixed in a new rev on CVS.  The icewm ebuild still isn't great, but is improving. ``` |  |
