The provided content is related to CVE-2017-6912.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing permission checks when using certain API calls to move data internally within the Open-Xchange App Suite. Specifically, the PIM attachment permissions were not correctly evaluated on "saveAs" operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate permission checks on API calls related to moving data
- Insufficient validation of PIM attachment permissions during "saveAs" operations

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with low privileges could potentially bypass intended permission restrictions and access or modify PIM attachments they should not have access to. This could potentially lead to information disclosure or unauthorized modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation of vulnerable API calls related to internal data movement
- Triggering "saveAs" operations on PIM attachments

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker requires low-level access or a valid user account within the Open-Xchange App Suite.
- No specific user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional details:**
- The fix was credited to Iordache Cosmin
- The issue was fixed in Open-Xchange AppSuite middleware 7.8.4-rev3
