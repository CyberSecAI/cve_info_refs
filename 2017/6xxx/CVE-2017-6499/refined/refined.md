Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how ImageMagick's Magick++ library handles nested exceptions. Specifically, when creating nested exceptions, the code was overwriting the pointer to the previous exception, resulting in a memory leak. The destructor of the exception object only deleted the last (leaf) exception object, leaving all the previous exception objects leaked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: The primary vulnerability is a memory leak, occurring due to improper handling of dynamically allocated memory for nested exception objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A specially crafted file can trigger the creation of nested exceptions leading to a memory leak. Repeatedly triggering the leak will exhaust memory, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted File: The attack vector is a specially crafted image file (or other file processed by ImageMagick) that triggers the creation of nested exceptions in Magick++.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a specially crafted file to ImageMagick for processing. No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `throwException` function within the `Exception.cpp` file of the Magick++ library.
- The fix involves preserving the previously created exception by nesting the new exception within it instead of overwriting the pointer to the previously created exception object. This allows the destructor to correctly free all nested exception objects and avoid the memory leak.
- The issue was reported and fixed by Dirk Lemstra after it was identified by a user named tc33.
- This vulnerability was fixed in imagemagick version 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-2 in unstable and 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u8 in stable (jessie).
