      "description": "The /cgi-bin/filemanager/utilRequest.cgi CGI has a command injection bug. The following commands are executed via system():\n\n/bin/kill -9 %s\n\nThe value inserted to %s is obtained from the `pid` HTTP request GET parameter.\n\nAn authenticated user can use a specially crafted pid parameter to execute arbitrary commands as root:\n\n$ curl -k 'https://TARGET/cgi-bin/filemanager/utilRequest.cgi?func=cancel_trash_recovery&sid=SIDVALUE&pid=`id>/tmp/pwned`'\n{ \"version\": \"4.2.1\", \"build\": \"20170213\", \"status\": 0, \"success\": \"true\" }\n\n[~] # cat /tmp/pwned\nuid=0(admin) gid=0(administrators) groups=0(administrators),100(everyone)\n[~] #",
       "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the `pid` parameter in the /cgi-bin/filemanager/utilRequest.cgi CGI script. The script directly uses the unsanitized input within a `system()` call, allowing for command injection.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "CWE-77 Command Injection"
        ],
        "impact": "An authenticated user can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected system. This allows full control over the device, including reading, modifying, or deleting data.",
        "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `/cgi-bin/filemanager/utilRequest.cgi` with the `func` parameter set to `cancel_trash_recovery` and the `pid` parameter containing the malicious command.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the affected system."
