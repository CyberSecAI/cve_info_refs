  "CVE-2017-6192": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "APNGDis 2.8 is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow due to a lack of validation of the chunk size descriptor, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the `read_chunk` function not validating the size of the chunk before allocating memory and copying data into the chunk. The `png_get_uint_32` function reads the chunk size from the input file, and this value is then used in a `new` allocation and a `memcpy`. When the chunk size is set to a large value, this results in either a very large allocation or a heap buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Lack of input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. When a large chunk size descriptor is provided, the program either tries to allocate an extremely large amount of memory, or it corrupts the heap metadata. In either case, the program crashes.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious PNG file where the chunk size descriptor is set to an extremely large value. The program is then run against the malicious file.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed file to the vulnerable application."
