Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-6353:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation within the Linux kernel.
- Specifically, it involves a race condition when a thread is waiting for send buffer space (sndbuf) on an SCTP association (asoc), and another thread attempts to "peel off" (move) that asoc to a different socket.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-after-free/Double Free:** The initial fix for a related bug (CVE-2017-5986) introduced a new vulnerability. If a peeloff operation occurs while a thread is sleeping on the asoc, the code might return without properly locking the socket, resulting in a double unlock. Further, it could lead to a double free if the peeled-off asoc was created during the sendmsg call.
- **Race Condition:** The core issue is the race condition between a thread waiting for send buffer space and another thread attempting to peel off the associated SCTP association.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user could trigger a crash due to the double free.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated as a direct path, the double-free vulnerability can sometimes be leveraged for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local access:** A local user with the ability to interact with SCTP sockets is required.
- **Specific actions:** The attacker needs to trigger a scenario where one thread is blocked waiting on `sndbuf`, while another attempts to peeloff the association.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create and manipulate SCTP sockets, specifically using the peeloff operation.
- No special privileges are required except the ability to use SCTP sockets.

**Mitigation:**

- The fix implemented in the provided patch prevents the peeloff operation if there is a thread sleeping/waiting on the association, effectively resolving the race condition and use-after-free/double-free vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered while reviewing a previous fix for CVE-2017-5986.
- The fix involves adding a check (`waitqueue_active(&asoc->wait)`) to the `sctp_do_peeloff` function to prevent the operation if threads are waiting on the association.
- The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation.
