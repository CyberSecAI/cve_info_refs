commit [2dcab59](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/2dcab598484185dea7ec22219c76dcdd59e3cb90) ("sctp: avoid BUG_ON on sctp_wait_for_sndbuf")
attempted to avoid a BUG_ON call when the association being used for a
sendmsg() is blocked waiting for more sndbuf and another thread did a
peeloff operation on such asoc, moving it to another socket.

As Ben Hutchings noticed, then in such case it would return without
locking back the socket and would cause two unlocks in a row.

Further analysis also revealed that it could allow a double free if the
application managed to peeloff the asoc that is created during the
sendmsg call, because then sctp_sendmsg() would try to free the asoc
that was created only for that call.

This patch takes another approach. It will deny the peeloff operation
if there is a thread sleeping on the asoc, so this situation doesn't
exist anymore. This avoids the issues described above and also honors
the syscalls that are already being handled (it can be multiple sendmsg
calls).

Joint work with Xin Long.

                 CVE-2017-6214 CVE-2017-6345 CVE-2017-6346 CVE-2017-6348
                 CVE-2017-6353

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other
impacts.

CVE-2016-9588

    Jim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel x86
    processors does not properly handle #BP and #OF exceptions in an
    L2 (nested) virtual machine. A local attacker in an L2 guest VM
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service for
    the L1 guest VM.

CVE-2017-2636

    Alexander Popov discovered a race condition flaw in the n_hdlc
    line discipline that can lead to a double free. A local
    unprivileged user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege
    escalation. On systems that do not already have the n_hdlc module
    loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-n_hdlc.conf install n_hdlc false

CVE-2017-5669

    Gareth Evans reported that privileged users can map memory at
    address 0 through the shmat() system call. This could make it
    easier to exploit other kernel security vulnerabilities via a
    set-UID program.

CVE-2017-5986

    Alexander Popov reported a race condition in the SCTP
    implementation that can be used by local users to cause a
    denial-of-service (crash). The initial fix for this was incorrect
    and introduced further security issues (CVE-2017-6353). This
    update includes a later fix that avoids those. On systems that do
    not already have the sctp module loaded, this can be mitigated by
    disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false

CVE-2017-6214

    Dmitry Vyukov reported a bug in the TCP implementation's handling
    of urgent data in the splice() system call. This can be used by a
    remote attacker for denial-of-service (hang) against applications
    that read from TCP sockets with splice().

CVE-2017-6345

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the LLC type 2 implementation
    incorrectly assigns socket buffer ownership. This can be used
    by a local user to cause a denial-of-service (crash). On systems
    that do not already have the llc2 module loaded, this can be
    mitigated by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-llc2.conf install llc2 false

CVE-2017-6346

    Dmitry Vyukov reported a race condition in the raw packet (af_packet)
    fanout feature. Local users with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any
    user namespace) can use this for denial-of-service and possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-6348

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the general queue implementation in
    the IrDA subsystem does not properly manage multiple locks,
    possibly allowing local users to cause a denial-of-service
    (deadlock) via crafted operations on IrDA devices.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.39-1+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

sctp: deny peeloff operation on asocs with threads sleeping on itcommit 2dcab5984841 ("sctp: avoid BUG\_ON on sctp\_wait\_for\_sndbuf")
attempted to avoid a BUG\_ON call when the association being used for a
sendmsg() is blocked waiting for more sndbuf and another thread did a
peeloff operation on such asoc, moving it to another socket.
As Ben Hutchings noticed, then in such case it would return without
locking back the socket and would cause two unlocks in a row.
Further analysis also revealed that it could allow a double free if the
application managed to peeloff the asoc that is created during the
sendmsg call, because then sctp\_sendmsg() would try to free the asoc
that was created only for that call.
This patch takes another approach. It will deny the peeloff operation
if there is a thread sleeping on the asoc, so this situation doesn't
exist anymore. This avoids the issues described above and also honors
the syscalls that are already being handled (it can be multiple sendmsg
calls).
Joint work with Xin Long.
