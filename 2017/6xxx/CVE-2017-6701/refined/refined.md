Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the web application interface of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The web application interface doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and later executed in the context of other users' browsers. This is identified by CWE-79.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored in the ISE system.
- When a user interacts with the vulnerable part of the web interface, the malicious script will be executed in the user's browser.
- This could lead to various impacts, including, but not limited to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Information theft through exfiltration

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
- User Interaction: The attack requires a user to interact with the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated remote attacker: The attacker doesn't need to have valid credentials for the ISE system, and the attack can be initiated from a remote location.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the vulnerable web application interface.
- The user needs to visit the compromised page for the malicious script to be executed.
