# Password Plaintext Storage

## NVD Categorization

> [CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html): Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

> [CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html): The application stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

## Description

Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext
in an application’s properties or configuration file. A programmer can
attempt to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the
password with an encoding function, such as base 64 encoding, but this
effort does not adequately protect the password.

Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who
can read the file access to the password-protected resource. Developers
sometimes believe that they cannot defend the application from someone
who has access to the configuration, but this attitude makes an
attacker’s job easier. Good password management guidelines require that
a password never be stored in plaintext.

## Examples

The following code reads a password from a properties file and uses the
password to connect to a database.

```
    ...
    Properties prop = new Properties();
    prop.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));
    String password = prop.getProperty("password");

    DriverManager.getConnection(url, usr, password);
    ...

```

## Product Security Advisory – PSA0002 – dnaLIMS

# Shorebreak Security Product Security Advisory

| Software | dnaLIMS |
| --- | --- |
| Vendor | dnaTools (http://www.dnatools.com/) |
| Version Tested | Version 4-2015s13 |
| Vulnerability Type | Multiple vulnerabilities |
| Severity | Critical |
| CERT/CC VU# | 929263 |
| Date Discovered | Nov 6, 2016 |
| Date Disclosed | Mar 8, 2017 |

## Summary

Shorebreak Security penetration testers discovered **seven serious vulnerabilities** in the dnaLIMS web application during the course of a blackbox penetration test for a customer. This was by no means a comprehensive review of the web application, and it should be assumed that many other vulnerabilities exist in the application.

Shorebreak notified the vendor, who appears to have no interest in fixing his flawed software that is in use on the Internet at several other organizations.

Our recommendation is to isolate this web application as much as possible to reduce the exposure – most definitely remove it from the Internet.

## Impact

An unauthenticated attacker has the ability to **execute system commands** in the context of the web server process, **hijack active user sessions**, **retrieve system files** (including the plaintext password file), and **inject untrusted html or JavaScript** into the dnaLIMS application. An attacker could use these vulnerabilities together in order to gain control of the application as well as the operating system hosting the dnaLIMS software. If this software is being hosted publicly or in a DMZ this could act as a pivot point to launch further attacks or move laterally into trusted network(s).

## Vulnerabilities

Seven individual vulnerabilities were identified. The following is a technical description of each individual vulnerability.

### 1) Improperly Protected Web Shell [CVE-2017-6526]

dnaLIMS requires authentication to view cgi-bin/dna/sysAdmin.cgi, which is a web shell included with the software running as the web user.  However, sending a POST request to that page bypasses authentication checks, including the UID parameter within the POST request.  This finding requires urgent attention as it is possible for any attacker on the internet to remotely control the server with only a trivial amount of web traffic.

[![sysadmin](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sysadmin.png)](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sysadmin.png)

[![sysadmin2](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sysadmin2.png)](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sysadmin2.png)

A Metasploit module has been developed to exploit this vulnerability.

### 2) Unauthenticated Directory Traversal [CVE-2017-6527]

The viewAppletFsa.cgi seqID parameter is vulnerable to a null terminated directory traversal attack. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve files on the operating system accessible by the permissions of the web server. This page also does not require authentication, allowing any person on the Internet to exploit this vulnerability.

[![seqID](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/seqID.png)](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/seqID.png)

A Metasploit module has been developed to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Additional Information

For more information about this type of issue, please visit the following URLs:

* [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Path\_Traversal\_Attack](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category%3APath_Traversal_Attack)

### 3) Insecure Password Storage [CVE-2017-6528]

An option, which is most likely the default, allows the password file (/home/dna/spool/.pfile) to store clear text passwords.  When combined with the unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerability, it is possible to gain the username and password for all users of the software and gain complete control of the software.

[![dnalims_password_file](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dnalims_password_file.png)](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dnalims_password_file.png)

A more secure option, which was not tested, allows for the hashing of passwords, which we believe uses an insecure MD5 algorithm. If true, this option should be upgraded to PBKDF2 or stronger (bcrypt or Argon2).

* <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Plaintext_Storage>

### 4) Session Hijacking [CVE-2017-6529]

Each user of the dnaLIMS software is assigned a unique four-digit user identification number(UID) upon account creation.  These numbers appear to be assigned sequentially. Multiple pages of the dnaLIMS application require that this UID be passed as a URL parameter in order to view the content of the page. Consider the following example:

The URL ‘http://<SERVER NAME REDACTED>/cgi-bin/dna/seqreq2N.cgi?username=61685578,2410’ is a valid URL to view the page for sequencing requests for the user with the UID of 2410.

[![seq_req](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/seq_req.png)](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/seq_req.png)

The username parameter of the URL is the mechanism for authentication to the system. The first eight-digit number of the username parameter appears to be a session identifier as it changes every time the user logs in from the password.cgi page, however this value is not checked by the seqreq2N.cgi page. This allows an attacker to guess the four-digit UID of valid user accounts that have an active session. The user with the UID of 2419 currently has an active session, so we can simply hijack this user’s session by requesting this page and specifying the UID 2419.

[![seq_req2](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/seq_req2.png)](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/seq_req2.png)

This allows an attacker to guess UID’s and hijack active user sessions.

###

### 5) Cross-Site Scripting

The seqID parameter of the viewAppletFsa.cgi page is vulnerable to a reflected cross site scripting attack via GET request as seen in the URL, in the example below.[![xss_1](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/xss_1.png)](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/xss_1.png)

* [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site\_Scripting\_(XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29)

### 6) Cross-Site Scripting

The navUserName parameter of the seqTable\*.cgi page is vulnerable to a reflected cross site scripting attack via POST request as seen in the example below. The \* reflects a short name for a client, (ie Shorebreak Security may be seqTableSS.cgi or seqTableshorebreak.cgi) and may not be vulnerable for all dnaLIMS installs.[![xss_2](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/xss_2.png)](https://www.shorebreaksecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/xss_2.png)

#### Additional Information

* [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site\_Scripting\_(XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29)

### 7) Improperly Protected Content

Many of the pages within the admin interface are not properly protected from viewing by authenticated users.  This can give an attacker additional system information about the system, or change system/software configuration.

Software was conducted on a live production system, therefore the pages themselves were tested, forms within these pages were not.

This is also not an exhaustive list of improperly protected pages:

* cgi-bin/dna/configuration.cgi
* cgi-bin/dna/createCoInfo.cgi
* cgi-bin/dna/configSystem.cgi
* cgi-bin/dna/combineAcctsN.cgi

## Risk Mitigation

To reduce the exposure, encourage customers to restrict access to the device from authorized hosts only.

## Vendor Fix

* Properly protect all administrative pages to only those with administrative privileges
* Implement a proper authentication mechanism that uses cookies with session IDs per OWASP guidance: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session\_Management\_Cheat\_Sheet

* Cross site scripting and directory traversal attacks are due to insufficient input validation. User content should be properly escaped to prevent abuse of functionality or attacks against clients per the OWASP XSS prevention cheat sheet: [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS\_(Cross\_Site\_Scripting)\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)

* Cryptographic functionality should utilize strong algorithms per the OWASPguidance: <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet#Secure_Cryptographic_Storage_Design>

Vendor: dnaTools, Inc.
CVE IDs: [2017-6526, 2017-6527, 2017-6528, 2017-6529]
USCERT VU: 929263

Vulnerability Summaries
1) Improperly protected web shell [CVE-2017-6526]
dnaLIMS requires authentication to view cgi-bin/dna/sysAdmin.cgi, which is
a web shell included with the software running as the web user.  However,
sending a POST request to that page bypasses authentication checks,
including the UID parameter within the POST request.

2) Unauthenticated Directory Traversal [CVE-2017-6527]
The viewAppletFsa.cgi seqID parameter is vulnerable to a null terminated
directory traversal attack. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to
retrieve files on the operating system accessible by the permissions of the

currently has an active session, so we can simply hijack this useras
session by requesting this page and specifying the UID 2419.

5) Cross-site Scripting
The seqID parameter of the viewAppletFsa.cgi page is vulnerable to a
reflected cross site scripting attack via GET request as seen in the
following URL:
http://<SERVER NAME REDACTED>/cgi-bin/dna/viewAppletFsa.cgi?seqID=7415-7<SCRIPT
Alert("XSS") </SCRIPT>

6) Cross-site Scripting
The navUserName parameter of the seqTable*.cgi page is vulnerable to a
reflected cross site scripting attack via POST request as seen in the
example below. The * reflects a short name for a client, (ie Shorebreak
Security may be seqTableSS.cgi or seqTableshorebreak.cgi) and may not be
vulnerable for all dnaLIMS installs.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
