Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Windows 7 handles DLL and OCX files, specifically how the system searches for and loads these files. Windows 7 allows for relative paths when searching for these files which can lead to the system loading a malicious file if it's found earlier in the search path than the legitimate file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The core issue is DLL hijacking. Windows 7 searches for DLLs using a relative path which makes it vulnerable to loading a malicious DLL if placed in a location that appears earlier in the search path than the legitimate DLL.
*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):**  The software does not enforce the correct path when loading DLLs and OCX files, making it possible for an attacker to place a malicious file in the search path to be loaded instead.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File Placement:** An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL or OCX file with the same name as a legitimate file into a location where the Windows search path will locate it before the legitimate file. This might involve techniques like social engineering or tricking the user into downloading and placing a malicious file in the required directory.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires the user to execute a specific application from a malicious directory, thereby triggering the search path to be used which loads the malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, implying the attacker can be on the same network or even external to the network.
*   **User Interaction/Social Engineering:** Exploitation requires some level of user interaction or social engineering to lure a user into downloading or placing a malicious file in the search path so that it is loaded by the vulnerable application.
*   **Privileged Access (Partial):** The vulnerability requires 'High' privilege to overwrite the target DLL in the appropriate folder.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Windows 10 is not vulnerable because it uses absolute paths when registering and searching for DLL and OCX files.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) which means it can be exploited remotely, has a low attack complexity, requires user interaction, and impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   The affected software is the IGSS HMI desktop application, version 12 and previous versions.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Karn Ganeshen.
*  The vendor recommends upgrading to Windows 10 as a mitigation.
