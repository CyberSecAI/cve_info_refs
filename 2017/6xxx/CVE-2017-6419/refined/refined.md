Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-6419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `libmspack` library, which is used to handle Microsoft compression formats (CAB and CHM files). Specifically, the issue lies in how `lzxd_decompress` function within `libmspack` processes LZ compressed data inside CHM files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A heap buffer overflow occurs during the decompression of crafted CHM files, specifically within the `mspack_fmap_copy` function, which is called from `lzxd_decompress` . This happens when decompressing a chunk of data and copying it into a buffer, leading to writing beyond allocated memory.
- **Stack-based buffer over-read:** A stack-based buffer over-read could also lead to application crash. (This vulnerability is also related to CVE-2017-11423).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition due to application crashes caused by buffer overflows/over-reads.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly confirmed, the advisory indicates a potential for arbitrary code execution, which is a serious concern with buffer overflows.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted CHM/CAB Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted CHM or CAB files. The crafted files exploit the improper input validation within the `libmspack` library during decompression.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Files:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted CHM or CAB file to a system that uses `libmspack` for decompression. This could involve:
    - Sending the file as an email attachment.
    - Hosting the file on a web server for download.
    - Embedding the malicious file in an archive or other container.
- **No Special Access Required:** The attacker does not require any specific system access beyond being able to provide the malicious files for scanning/processing by a vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The heap overflow is triggered in `lzxd_decompress` function when processing `LZX_BLOCKTYPE_UNCOMPRESSED` block type within a crafted CHM file when `window_posn + this_run` exceeds `lzx->window_size`.
- The `mspack_fmap_copy` function copies data from input to an allocated memory region. If this copy exceeds the allocated buffer size, it can lead to a crash.

**Affected Software:**
- `libmspack` library versions prior to 0.5-1+deb8u1 (jessie) and 0.5-1+deb9u1 (stretch).
- ClamAV versions prior to 0.99.4 which relies on the vulnerable `libmspack` library.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade `libmspack` to the patched versions.
- Upgrade ClamAV to a version where the vulnerable library is updated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided ASAN (AddressSanitizer) crash log demonstrates a heap-buffer-overflow in `mspack_fmap_copy` when called within the decompression routine.
- The patch for the vulnerability includes a check to ensure that data being written during decompression does not exceed the allocated window size, preventing the overflow.
