Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an invalid memory read within the `jas_matrix_bindsub` function located in `jas_seq.c`. This occurs when processing a crafted image, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Invalid Memory Read:** The core issue is an attempt to read memory at an invalid address. This is triggered by specific crafted image data.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability suggests insufficient validation or handling of input image data which allows the program to reach a state where the memory access occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the application, leading to a denial of service. The application terminates due to a segmentation fault triggered by the invalid memory read.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file. The specific structure or content of the image triggers the invalid memory read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted image file to a vulnerable application that uses the JasPer library. This could be through direct file processing, or indirectly via web applications or other services that process images.
- **No Special Privileges Required:**  The provided information does not suggest any special privileges are required on the system or the application to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in `jas_matrix_bindsub` function within `jas_seq.c` at line 254.
- The AddressSanitizer output indicates a SEGV (segmentation violation) caused by a READ memory access at an unknown address.
- The issue was found through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).

**Affected Versions:**
- `media-libs/jasper` versions 2.0.10 and earlier are affected.
- Gentoo advisory specifies versions <= 2.0.16 as affected, although this bug was reported in 2.0.10

**Resolution:**
- The provided Gentoo security advisory recommends unmerging the Jasper package due to the high number of vulnerabilities and lack of upstream maintenance.
- There is no fixed version or commit fix specified in the provided content.

**CVE Summary**
The CVE-2017-6851 is an invalid memory read vulnerability in `jas_matrix_bindsub` function within `jas_seq.c` of JasPer library.  A crafted image file can cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service.
