- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA TrustZone Software's Keymaster implementation, where the software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to denial of service or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker with low privileges. The user interface is not required. The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the environment.
