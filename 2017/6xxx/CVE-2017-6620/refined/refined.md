Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the remote management access control list (ACL) feature of the Cisco CVR100W Wireless-N VPN Router. Specifically, the ACL is not properly enforced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the remote management ACL. This means that an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the router's remote management interface, even if they are not explicitly permitted by the configured ACL.
- **Improper Access Control:** The ACL implementation is flawed, leading to insufficient access control enforcement. This allows traffic that should be blocked based on the ACL to reach the router's management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to the router's management interface without authentication or authorization.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** With access to the management interface, an attacker could potentially reconfigure the router, change its firmware, or use it as a pivot point for further attacks on the network.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive information stored on the router or transmitted through it.
- While the CVSS score indicates a Low Confidentiality impact, there is no explicit impact on Integrity or Availability according to the provided information in the CVSS vector. However, the text suggests that further compromise is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attack vector is over the network, meaning the attacker does not require local access to the device.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have valid credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable router's remote management interface.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials or valid user information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that there are no workarounds available, making a patch the primary mitigation strategy.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco CVR100W Wireless-N VPN Routers with firmware prior to 1.0.1.24.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by security researcher *opalliosl*.
