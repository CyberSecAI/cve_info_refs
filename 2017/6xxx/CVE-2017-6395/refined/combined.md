## Description

[![@bestshow](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5211744?v=4&size=48)](/bestshow)[bestshow](https://github.com/bestshow)opened [on Feb 27, 2017](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next/issues/152#issue-210520525)

Product：HashOver

Download: <https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover-next>

Vunlerable Version: 2.0 and and probably prior

Tested Version: 2.0

Author: ADLab of Venustech

Advisory Details:

I have discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in “HashOver”, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in “hashover-script” HTTP GET parameter passed to “hashover/scripts/widget-output.php” url. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to see a pop-up messagebox:

Poc:

[http://localhost/.../hashover-next-master/hashover/scripts/widget-output.php?hashover-script=%27;}%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3Efunction%20test(){](http://localhost/.../hashover-next-master/hashover/scripts/widget-output.php?hashover-script=%27;%7D%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3Efunction%20test()%7B)
