Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `moveitisapi.dll` file of the MOVEit Transfer product.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a (blind) SQL injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability indicates a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to compromise user accounts without prior authentication.
- **Unauthorized File Access:** This allows an attacker to download almost every exchanged file on the system.
- **Potential Code Execution:** In specific installation scenarios, the vulnerability might be escalated to achieve code execution or complete system compromise.
- **Data Breach:** The vulnerability can lead to a significant data breach due to the unauthorized download of sensitive files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `moveitisapi.dll` component of the MOVEit Transfer software.
- It can be triggered via network requests to the vulnerable application component.
- The attack vector is through a web application component, specifically the ISAPI dll.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the MOVEit Transfer server to send malicious requests.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the MOVEit application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** An attacker requires a solid understanding of SQL injection techniques to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects MOVEit Transfer versions prior to 9.0.201, MOVEit DMZ versions prior to 8.3.0.30, 8.2.0.20, and 8.2.X.
- The MOVEit Transfer product ships with a MySQL database by default but can also be configured with MSSQL. The default MySQL database user has limited rights which may mitigate the severity of the vulnerability in default configurations.
- Query stacking is not possible, and the injection point is within a `SELECT` query, limiting direct modifications to the database.
- The vendor was notified on 2016-12-19, and a fix was verified by siberas on 2017-01-09.
- The vendor provided a private alert to customers in March of 2017.
- The CVE was published on 2017-05-18.
