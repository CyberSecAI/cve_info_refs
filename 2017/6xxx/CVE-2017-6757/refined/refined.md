Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6757:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in Cisco Unified Communications Manager that allows for blind SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the queries.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** This specific type of SQL injection makes it harder to directly see the database's response. The attacker must infer information based on the application's behavior, often through timing or error responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from the database.
- The vulnerability has a confidentiality and integrity impact classified as low, and no impact on availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- The attacker does not require user interaction (UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker has to be a remote user.

**CVSS Metrics:**
-   **CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N**
    -   Attack Vector: Network (N)
