The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities within the Mail-Masta 1.0 WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, which leads to SQL injection. The plugin directly incorporates GET and POST parameters into SQL queries without using parameterized queries or other escaping mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin has multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in various files due to unsanitized input:
- `csvexport.php`: Unauthenticated GET parameter `list_id` is directly used in SQL query.
- `view-list.php`: Authenticated (admin) GET parameter `filter_list` is directly used in SQL query.
- `count_of_send.php`: Authenticated (admin) POST parameter `camp_id` is directly used in SQL query.
- `campaign_save.php`: Authenticated (admin) POST parameter `list_id` is directly used in SQL query.
- `view-campaign-list.php`: Authenticated (admin) GET parameter `id` is directly used in SQL query.
- `view-campaign.php`: Authenticated (admin) GET parameter `id` is directly used in SQL query.
- `add_member.php`: Authenticated (admin) GET parameter `filter_list` is directly used in SQL query.
- `edit-list.php`: Authenticated (admin) GET parameter `id` is directly used in SQL query.
- `edit_member.php`: Authenticated (admin) GET parameters `filter_list` and `member_id` are directly used in SQL queries.
- `campaign-delete.php`: Authenticated (admin) GET parameter `id` is directly used in SQL query.
- `subscriber_list.php`: Authenticated (admin) POST parameter `list_id` is directly used in SQL query. Also, POST parameter `subscriber_email` is used in a vulnerable manner.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to:
- Read sensitive data from the database.
- Modify or delete data in the database.
- Potentially gain control over the WordPress site and the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: Several vulnerabilities are exposed through GET parameters in URLs.
- HTTP POST requests: Some vulnerabilities are exposed through POST parameters sent in requests.
- Unauthenticated access: `csvexport.php` is vulnerable without requiring authentication.
- Authenticated (admin) access: Most of the vulnerabilities require an authenticated user with administrative privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For unauthenticated access to `csvexport.php`, no special capabilities are required, only network access to the WordPress application.
- For authenticated vulnerabilities, an attacker needs to have an administrative user account to log into WordPress and access the vulnerable pages and features.
