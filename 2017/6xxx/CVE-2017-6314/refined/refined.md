{
  "CVE-2017-6314": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow leading to an infinite loop in the `make_available_at_least` function within `io-tiff.c`. When the required allocation size (`need_alloc`) is greater than 2^31, the `new_size` variable overflows to zero, resulting in an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Infinite Loop"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service. The vulnerable application would get stuck in an infinite loop, leading to a crash or unresponsiveness.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted TIFF image. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malformed TIFF file to an application that uses gdk-pixbuf for image processing.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted TIFF file to an application that relies on the vulnerable `gdk-pixbuf` library. The attacker does not need to be in a specific position, as long as the application is processing the attacker's supplied image file. This could be via a file upload, a website, or any other mechanism that allows the target application to parse a TIFF image."
