Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the web-based management interface of the Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability (CWE-79). This means that malicious script can be injected into the system and stored, and then executed when other users access the affected part of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An authenticated, remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the system through the web interface.
*   When a user interacts with the affected part of the web interface, the stored malicious script executes. This can potentially lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality Impact (Low):**  The attacker might be able to access some information accessible to the user who views the malicious content.
    *   **Integrity Impact (Low):** The attacker might be able to modify some data or perform actions on behalf of the user who views the malicious content.
    *   **No Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N):** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access (PR:L):** The attacker needs to have low-level access (authentication) to the web interface of the Cisco Secure ACS to inject the malicious script.
*   **User Interaction (UI:R):**  The attack requires user interaction; a victim user must access the page where the malicious script is stored in order to trigger it.
*   **Changed Scope (S:C):** The vulnerability's impact extends beyond the direct context of the vulnerable component (the web interface), potentially affecting the user's session and other parts of the application the user has access to.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.4 (Medium severity).
*   No workarounds are available, and affected customers need to install the fixed software release.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Mikhail Klyuchnikov from Positive Technologies.
