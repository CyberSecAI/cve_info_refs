Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6439:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `parse_string_node` function within `bplist.c`. It arises from insufficient bounds checking when handling string nodes in binary property lists (bplist). Specifically, the size of the string data is not properly validated against the provided data range, leading to out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The `parse_string_node` function allocates memory for the string data based on a size parameter read from the bplist. If the provided size is larger than the actual remaining data in the bplist, it causes a heap-based buffer overflow when writing the string data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to an out-of-bounds write, resulting in memory corruption. This can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted plist file:** An attacker must provide a specially crafted bplist file to trigger this vulnerability. The malicious file will contain a string node with an invalid size parameter.
- **Local User:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted plist file to the vulnerable application to parse it. This indicates the attacker needs local access to the system or the ability to influence the data processed by the application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The github issue #95 shows a crash report from AddressSanitizer that clearly identifies the heap-buffer-overflow in the `parse_string_node` function at `bplist.c:298`.
- The code diff shows the fix involved adding a size check within `parse_bin_node` function, which is called by `parse_string_node` to make sure that the size parameter is within valid range `if (*object + size < *object || *object + size > bplist->offset_table)`. This check validates if the current data pointer (`*object`) plus the size goes out of the bounds of the plist's offset table.
- The commit message also mentions that a size of `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` passed to `parse_string_node()` could lead to `memcpy` with a size of `-1`.
- This vulnerability was discovered by OSS-Fuzz.
