  "CVE-2017-6315": {
    "Description": "Astaro Security Gateway v7 - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of serialized objects by the Astaro Security Gateway (ASG) v7 software. By sending a crafted serialized object containing malicious perl code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution",
      "Deserialization vulnerability",
      "Insecure handling of serialized objects",
      "Perl code execution vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution on the vulnerable system with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/index.plx` endpoint",
       "Exploitation of a deserialization vulnerability via a crafted perl object",
      "Establishing a reverse shell connection"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ASG v7 server",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/index.plx`) and the required request format",
        "The attacker needs to know their own IP address, and must be able to run a script to listen on certain ports"
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The exploit leverages a vulnerability in how the ASG v7 processes serialized perl objects. The exploit sends a crafted serialized perl object that contains a reverse shell payload and the perl code is executed with root permissions, achieving remote command execution. The exploit uses three socket connections to fully exploit the vulnerability and gain a reverse shell. The exploit script provides the perl payload used to achieve the RCE. The exploit was tested on versions 7.500 and 7.506 of Astaro Security Gateway v7. Sophos acquired Astaro in 2011."
