Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6773

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions in the command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Aggregated Services Routers running the Cisco StarOS operating system. This lack of proper CLI restriction allows an attacker to bypass intended limitations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient CLI Restrictions:** The primary weakness is the inadequate enforcement of restrictions within the CLI, allowing for the execution of unauthorized commands.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The advisory refers to CWE-20, which indicates improper input validation, suggesting that the CLI might not be properly sanitizing or verifying user-provided input, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Command Execution:** An attacker can bypass CLI restrictions and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This could lead to:
    - Gaining unauthorized access to the system.
    - Modifying system configurations.
    - Disrupting services.
    - Potentially taking complete control of the affected device.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a high impact on all three aspects, meaning that exploitation could lead to a significant breach of confidentiality, corruption of data, and loss of availability of the affected router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can only be exploited by an attacker with local access to the device. This usually implies either physical access or access to the device's console via a terminal emulator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the device, i.e., have valid user credentials for the CLI.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.

**Additional Notes**
- The advisory mentions that there are no workarounds to address the vulnerability and that users should update to the patched software.
- The CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This vector shows that the attack vector is local (AV:L), attack complexity is high (AC:H), privileges required are high (PR:H), no user interaction is required (UI:N), scope is unchanged (S:U) and the impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability are all high (C:H, I:H, A:H).
