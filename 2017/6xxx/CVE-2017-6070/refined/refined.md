Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2017-6070**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient permission checks in the `admin_store_form` functionality of the CMS Made Simple Form Builder module. This allows unauthenticated users to manipulate form templates.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious PHP code within Smarty tags into the `cntnt01fbrp_forma_form_template` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. The code is executed when the form is displayed on a page.
    *   **Input Sanitization Bypass:** The CMS input sanitizer escapes or removes certain characters, but the vulnerability can be circumvented by using `include()` or `file_get_contents()` to fetch and execute code from a remote server.
    *   **Stored XSS:** Though limited by sanitization, stored cross-site scripting (XSS) can be achieved using `eval` to inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Full compromise of the web server is possible by executing arbitrary PHP code.
    *   Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., database credentials stored in the configuration file) by using `file_get_contents()`.
    *   Malicious code execution can lead to information disclosure, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
    *   Stored XSS can compromise users of the website.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP requests to specific administrative pages without authorization checks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the webserver.
    *   The attacker must identify a valid `form_id` or enumerate through valid values for `form_id` to target the correct form.
    *   No prior authentication is required.

**CVE-2017-6071**

*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper authorization checks in the `exportxml` function.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure through XML export.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information such as email addresses and other form properties.
*  **Attack Vectors:** HTTP requests to specific administrative pages without authorization checks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the webserver.
    *    The attacker must identify a valid `form_id` or enumerate through valid values for `form_id` to target the correct form.
    *    No prior authentication is required.

**CVE-2017-6072**
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper authorization checks in the `defaultadmin` function.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure by exposing the site's forms.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can view all the forms available on the website and find the XML upload form.
*  **Attack Vectors:** HTTP requests to specific administrative pages without authorization checks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the webserver.
    *    No prior authentication is required.
