Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the insecure processing of user-supplied URLs by the Grails PDF plugin, coupled with the use of the Flying Saucer library for HTML-to-PDF conversion, which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The plugin fetches and renders the content of a provided URL, and if that content contains a malicious XML payload, it will be parsed, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The Flying Saucer library's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE injection. By providing a specially crafted HTML page containing an XML doctype with an external entity, an attacker can read local files on the server.
*   **Open Redirect:** The plugin redirects users to a URL specified in the `url` parameter of a GET request in case of error. This is used to inject a malicious HTML payload by redirecting a request to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Insecure URL Handling:** The plugin directly fetches and renders content from a user-supplied URL without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to manipulate the URL and bypass security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, including sensitive configuration files, passwords, and other confidential data.
*   **Internal Network Mapping:** By fetching files, the attacker can obtain information about internal network configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker sends a GET request to the `/pdf/pdfForm` endpoint with a crafted `url` parameter. This initial request triggers a redirect to the attacker-controlled server.
* The attacker hosts a malicious HTML page on their server. This page contains an XML doctype declaration with an external entity pointing to the resource on the target server to be accessed (e.g. `/etc/passwd`).
* The targeted server fetches the malicious HTML page when processing the user request, triggering the XXE vulnerability.
* The content of the specified file is then returned to the attacker as part of the generated PDF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Grails application.
*   The attacker needs a server to host the malicious HTML file, which is accessible to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to know the target application's base URL.
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
