The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities fixed in WordPress 4.7.3.  Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed in WordPress 4.7.3:**

1.  **Cross-site scripting (XSS) via media file metadata:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied metadata associated with media files.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in a victim's browser when they view the media file or a page containing it.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Uploading media files with malicious metadata.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires ability to upload media files, possibly as a Contributor.

2.  **Control characters can trick redirect URL validation:**
    *   **Weakness:** The redirect URL validation was susceptible to being bypassed by using control characters.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could craft malicious URLs that would redirect users to a harmful website, even if they were supposed to be on a trusted domain.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafting URLs containing control characters.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Requires ability to submit or manipulate URLs.

3.  **Unintended files can be deleted by administrators using the plugin deletion functionality:**
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure implementation of the plugin deletion feature, allowing an administrator to potentially delete files beyond plugin directories.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file deletion, potentially leading to system compromise or denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Using the plugin deletion functionality with carefully crafted parameters.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires administrative access.

4.  **Cross-site scripting (XSS) via video URL in YouTube embeds:**
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of video URLs when embedding YouTube videos.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in a victim's browser when they view the page containing the embedded video.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Inserting crafted URLs in YouTube embeds.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires the ability to create or edit content with video embeds, possibly as a Contributor.

5.  **Cross-site scripting (XSS) via taxonomy term names:**
    *  **Weakness:**  Improper sanitization of taxonomy term names.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute when users interact with those terms.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Creating or editing taxonomy term names to include malicious scripts.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to create or modify taxonomy terms, possibly as a Contributor.

6.  **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) in Press This leading to excessive use of server resources:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper CSRF protection in the "Press This" functionality.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could force a victim's browser to make requests that consume excessive server resources.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Tricking an authenticated user into submitting a malicious request via a CSRF attack.
     *  **Required Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated user to be tricked into performing the malicious action.
