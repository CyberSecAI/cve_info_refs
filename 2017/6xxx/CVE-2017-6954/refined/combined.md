This is really perfect. I customized minor things in CSS, but otherwise it just works perfectly out-of-the-box. It’s lightweight and yet very effective.
If you need collaborative documents functionality in a BuddyBoss environment this does the job perfectly. I use it in a community where people share attachments mostly: I have folders and then one Doc per category of attachment; people can add attachments, edit the description, etc. The access control is also granular.
It was useful to find the author’s code snippets on github for customizations (such as global folders).

The plugin provides a great collaboration tool. Just a tiny request: add an option to allow friends or specific persons to read, edit and comment on the docs.
