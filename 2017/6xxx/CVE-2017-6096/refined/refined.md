The provided content relates to CVE-2017-6096.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in several files of the Mail Masta WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `list_id`, `filter_list`, `camp_id`, and `id` parameters are directly included in SQL queries without proper escaping or prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerabilities are present in multiple files within the Mail Masta plugin:
*   `csvexport.php`: Unauthenticated SQL injection via the `list_id` GET parameter.
*   `view-list.php`: SQL injection via the `filter_list` GET parameter, requires WordPress admin privileges.
*   `count_of_send.php`: SQL injection via the `camp_id` POST parameter, requires WordPress admin privileges.
*   `campaign_save.php`: SQL injection via the `list_id` POST parameter, requires WordPress admin privileges, also present via an AJAX request in `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
*   `view-campaign-list.php`: SQL injection via the `id` GET parameter, requires WordPress admin privileges.
*   `view-campaign.php`: SQL injection via the `id` GET parameter, requires WordPress admin privileges.
*   `add_member.php`: SQL injection via the `filter_list` GET parameter, requires WordPress admin privileges.
*   `edit-list.php`: SQL injection via the `id` GET parameter, requires WordPress admin privileges.
*    `edit_member.php`: SQL injection via the `filter_list` and `member_id` GET parameters, requires WordPress admin privileges.
*  `campaign-delete.php`: SQL injection via the `id` GET parameter, requires WordPress admin privileges.
* `subscriber_list.php`: SQL injection via the `list_id` POST parameter and the `email` POST parameter requires WordPress admin privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the WordPress database.
*   Modify or delete data within the database.
*   Potentially gain full control of the WordPress site by injecting malicious code or creating new admin accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors vary depending on the vulnerable file:
*   Unauthenticated SQL injection: `csvexport.php` can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request containing malicious SQL code in the `list_id` parameter.
*   Authenticated SQL injection: The other vulnerable files require an authenticated WordPress administrator session to be exploited. Malicious SQL code can be injected through the specified GET or POST parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   For `csvexport.php`, the attacker does not need any authentication.
*   For all other vulnerable files, the attacker needs to be logged into a WordPress administrator account.
