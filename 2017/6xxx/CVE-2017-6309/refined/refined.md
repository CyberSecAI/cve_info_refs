Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-6309:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Out-of-bounds write vulnerability within the `src/mapi_attr.c:mapi_attr_read()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **OOB Writes:** The vulnerability involves two out-of-bounds write issues within the `mapi_attr_read()` function. These occur during the processing of MAPI attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution by allowing an attacker to control invalid read and write operations.
*   **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds write can potentially cause a denial-of-service by crashing the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a specially crafted MIME attachment of the type "application/ms-tnef".
*   The user must be tricked into opening a malicious winmail.dat file that contains a crafted MAPI attribute to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious TNEF file.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into processing the malicious file with the vulnerable version of `tnef`.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Eric Sesterhenn from X41 D-Sec GmbH.
*   The affected versions of tnef are 1.4.12 and earlier. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4.13.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3798-1 references this CVE along with CVE-2017-6307, CVE-2017-6308 and CVE-2017-6310.
