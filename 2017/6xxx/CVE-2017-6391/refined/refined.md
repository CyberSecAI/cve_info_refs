The provided content relates to CVE-2017-6391.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `$_GET` array in several PHP files of the Kaltura server. Specifically, values extracted from `$_GET` are directly embedded into HTML or JavaScript code without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code through unsanitized `$_GET` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious code execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed in the context of the user's browser, allowing actions like session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious sites, etc.
- Defacement: The attacker can modify the appearance of the vulnerable page.
- Information disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL parameters: The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript within the `$_GET` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft and deliver a URL to a user of the affected Kaltura server.
- The attacker does not need prior access or high privileges; the vulnerability is exploitable by anyone with the ability to generate a malicious URL and have a user access it.

**Additional Details:**

The provided commit `041a6d5e8336f7713985b120139c8f4b6279a337` addresses the vulnerability by adding `strip_tags()` to sanitize the `$_GET` parameters in the following files:
- `admin_console/web/tools/AkamaiBroadcaster.php`
- `admin_console/web/tools/SimpleJWPlayer.php`
- `admin_console/web/tools/XmlJWPlayer.php`
- `admin_console/web/tools/bigRedButton.php`
- `admin_console/web/tools/bigRedButtonPtsPoc.php`

This sanitization attempts to prevent the injection of HTML and JavaScript by stripping out HTML tags. While this patch provides a mitigation, it does not perform the appropriate contextual output encoding which is required for full XSS protection.
