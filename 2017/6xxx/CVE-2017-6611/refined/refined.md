Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the web framework code of Cisco Prime Infrastructure. Specifically, the web framework does not properly sanitize user-supplied input leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS (CWE-79). The web framework allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access a compromised page.
- This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Deface the web page
    - Redirect the user to malicious sites
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Access sensitive information displayed on the page

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability via the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure by injecting malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be remote and unauthenticated (PR:N).
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL or other input that includes a cross-site scripting payload.
- The attacker must entice the victim to access the crafted malicious link or input on the affected Prime Infrastructure web interface.

**CVSS Score:**
- Base Score: 5.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Infrastructure.
- No workarounds are available.
- The advisory mentions the Cisco bug ID CSCuw65830.
- No public announcements or malicious use was known at the time of the advisory.
