Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-6658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer over-read vulnerability exists within the Snort++ (Snort 3) protocol decoder array. The size of the decoder array was off by one, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Over-read:** The primary vulnerability is that the decoder array was incorrectly sized, allowing an attacker to read past the end of the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition on the Snort++ system. This is because the out-of-bounds read could cause a crash, preventing the system from functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted network packet. Specifically, a packet with an ether type of 0xFFFF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any prior authentication.
*   **Packet crafting ability:** The attacker needs the ability to craft network packets with the specific ether type value (0xFFFF).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Snort++ (Snort 3) which was in the alpha testing stage at the time of discovery.
*   Current stable releases of Snort are NOT affected.
*   The fix for this issue involves increasing the size of the decoder array.
*   Fixes are available in the GitHub code repository tagged as BUILD\_233.

In summary, CVE-2017-6658 involves a buffer over-read in the Snort++ protocol decoder array, which can be exploited remotely by sending a packet with an ether type of 0xFFFF, leading to a denial of service. The fix involved increasing the array size.
