Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6817:

**Verification:**

The provided documents mention CVE-2017-6817 in the context of a WordPress security update, which aligns with the provided CVE ID.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability relates to how WordPress handles redirects and how control characters can trick redirect URL validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue lies in the failure to properly sanitize or validate URLs, specifically when handling control characters. This allows malicious actors to inject characters that can cause the redirect mechanism to behave unexpectedly or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Redirect:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website, which could be a phishing page or a site hosting malicious content.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could use this to craft URLs that appear legitimate but redirect to malicious login pages, stealing user credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to pages that trigger downloads of malware.
*  **Bypass of security mechanisms**: By tricking the validation, attackers can bypass redirect protection mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a URL with specific control characters that are not properly sanitized by WordPress' redirect validation logic.
*  **Redirection through vulnerable links**: An attacker can construct a malicious link and trick users to click on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs and get users to click them, which usually means the attacker must have a way to distribute the manipulated URLs.
*   No specific privileges within the WordPress system are needed; the vulnerability is triggered by the user's browser request to the crafted URL.
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in WordPress version 4.7.3, along with other security patches.
*   The issue was reported by Daniel Chatfield.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3815-1 also addresses this vulnerability along with CVE-2017-6814, CVE-2017-6815 and CVE-2017-6816.
*  The vulnerability is also discussed in the context of version 4.7.3 release notes on wordpress.org and the list of files revised.
