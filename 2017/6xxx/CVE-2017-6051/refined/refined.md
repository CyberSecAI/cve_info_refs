- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application has an uncontrolled search path element vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application searches for DLL files in an uncontrolled manner, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL within the search path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can place a malicious DLL file in the search path used by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in a directory that is part of the application's DLL search path, which is typically local access to the system, however there are many techniques to achieve this remotely. The attack requires user interaction.
