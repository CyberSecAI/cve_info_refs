```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `ColorChanger::GetColorFromStack` function of the PoDoFo library. This occurs when the function attempts to access a member of a potentially null pointer.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Null pointer dereference

Impact of exploitation:
- Program crash due to segmentation fault (SEGV). This can lead to a denial-of-service.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted PDF file using the `podofocolor` tool, which utilizes the PoDoFo library.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PDF file to the `podofocolor` tool.
