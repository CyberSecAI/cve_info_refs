Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a missing boundary check in the `TNEFFillMapi` function when processing MAPI properties. Specifically, when reading a GUID and a length from the input data stream, the code fails to ensure that enough data remains in the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code reads data beyond the allocated buffer when processing the length of a MAPI property. If `PROP_ID(mp->id)` is greater than or equal to `0x8000`, the code reads 16 bytes for the GUID, then attempts to read 4 bytes for the length using `SwapDWord`. If the remaining buffer is smaller, an out of bound read will occur

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leak:** By reading out-of-bounds, the attacker could potentially leak sensitive information from the process's memory.
- **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds read could lead to a crash of the application processing the TNEF file.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted `winmail.dat` file (TNEF file).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to provide a crafted TNEF file to a user or application that utilizes the vulnerable `ytnef` library.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick the user or system into opening or processing the malicious winmail.dat file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in `ytnef` version 1.9.1.
- The fix involves adding a `SIZECHECK` macro to ensure that there is enough data in the buffer before attempting to read from it.
- This vulnerability is one of several issues discovered in `ytnef` around the same time, as indicated in the provided advisory from X41 D-Sec.
