Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6445:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of security in the OpenElec auto-update mechanism. Specifically, it does not use encrypted connections (like HTTPS) nor does it verify the integrity of downloaded updates via digital signatures. This allows a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to intercept and modify update packages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unencrypted connections:** The update mechanism uses plain HTTP to download updates.
*   **Lack of signature verification:**  Downloaded updates are not cryptographically signed, allowing for tampering.
*   **Insecure update process:** The combination of unencrypted connections and lack of signature verification allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful MitM attack allows the attacker to inject malicious code into an update package, gaining root access on the target OpenElec system once the modified update is installed and the system reboots.
*   **Full System Compromise:** As the attacker gains root access, they have complete control over the compromised device.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the OpenElec device and the update server to intercept and modify the update traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network proximity:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the OpenElec device and the update server. This typically requires being on the same local network or having control over a router or other network infrastructure through which the device's traffic passes.
*   **Ability to perform MitM:**  The attacker needs the capability to intercept, modify, and forward network traffic. This often involves tools like ARP poisoning or DNS spoofing.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit script shows how to inject a reverse shell into the kodi startup script which gets executed after a reboot. The script also demonstrates how to repackage the modified update.
* The vulnerability was present in OpenElec versions 6.x.x, 7.x.x and 8.x.x.
*  The vulnerability was disclosed as zero-day after no response from OpenElec.
