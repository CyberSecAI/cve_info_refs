**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Virtual Network Function Manager's (VNFM) logging function within the Cisco Ultra Services Platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Plaintext credential logging: The system logs sensitive information, including credentials, in plaintext.
-  Information Disclosure: This improper handling of sensitive data allows an attacker to view this information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to sensitive data, specifically credentials, by viewing the plaintext logs.
- Although not explicitly stated, such credentials could potentially be used for further unauthorized access or control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the affected system to view the log files containing the plaintext credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the system to access the log files

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity
- There are no workarounds available and a software fix is necessary.
- The CVSS base score is 4.7, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. This indicates a local attack vector with high confidentiality impact.
