Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inadequate sanitization of redirect URLs in WordPress. Specifically, control characters could be embedded within the URL, tricking the redirect validation logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `wp_validate_redirect` function failed to properly strip control characters from the provided URL before performing validation.
-   **URL Validation Bypass:** The presence of control characters allowed malicious URLs to pass the validation checks, leading to the potential for redirects to attacker-controlled sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Redirect to Malicious Sites:** Successful exploitation would redirect users to potentially malicious websites. This can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Manipulated URL Parameters:** An attacker could inject the control characters within a URL parameter that is later used for redirection purposes by WordPress.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the redirect URLs that WordPress uses. This could be done by directly manipulating the URL or through other input mechanisms that are passed into the vulnerable functions of WordPress.

**Technical Details:**
The fix involves stripping control characters from the redirect URL by adding this line to the `wp_validate_redirect` function:

```php
$location = trim( $location, " \t\n\r\0\x08\x0B" );
```

This change ensures that control characters are removed before validation, preventing the bypass.
The commit also modifies `wp-includes/version.php` to reflect the updated version number.

**Additional Notes:**
This vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 4.7.3.
The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3815-1 also mentions this vulnerability as part of a larger security update for WordPress.
