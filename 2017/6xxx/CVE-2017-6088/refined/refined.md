Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6088

**Description:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in EyesOfNetwork (EON) version 5.0.  The Eonweb application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Root Cause:** The primary cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization when building SQL queries. User-supplied parameters are directly concatenated into SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Database Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and other potentially confidential information.
* **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:**  Attackers can execute any arbitrary SQL query, potentially leading to data modification, deletion, or even complete compromise of the database.
* **Privilege Escalation:** In one of the proof of concepts, the vulnerability is executed with MySQL root privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious HTTP requests that contain SQL injection payloads within specific parameters.
* **Authentication Required:** Exploitation requires the attacker to be an authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the EON application.
* **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the EON web application.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations and Parameters:**
*   `module/admin_bp/php/function_bp.php`: The `bp_name` and `display` parameters within the `list_process` action are vulnerable (Proof of Concept 1).
*   `module/monitoring_ged/ajax.php`: The `type` parameter is vulnerable when processing active queue requests (Proof of Concept 2).
*   `module/monitoring_ged/ajax.php`: The `search` parameter is vulnerable when processing active queue requests (Proof of Concept 3).
*    `module/monitoring_ged/ged_actions.php`: The `filter` parameter is vulnerable within the `advancedFilterSearch` action (Proof of Concept 4).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes multiple proof-of-concept examples, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerabilities using different parameters.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS base score of 6.0.
*   The fix involves updating to version 5.1 of the EON application.
