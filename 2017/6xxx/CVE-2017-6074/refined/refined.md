Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-6074:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A use-after-free flaw exists in the Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation. This occurs when the kernel frees socket buffer (SKB) resources associated with a DCCP\_PKT\_REQUEST packet while the IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO option is set on the socket.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Use-after-free. The kernel frees the SKB but still maintains a pointer to it. A subsequent operation attempts to use the now freed memory region.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Privilege escalation:** A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to alter kernel memory, potentially allowing them to escalate their privileges to root.
*   **Denial of service:** The double-free could lead to a system crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Memory Corruption**: By controlling the memory region where the freed skb used to be, an attacker could gain arbitrary kernel memory writes.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Local exploitation: A local, unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability
*   The exploit requires IPV6 to be enabled.
*  For exploitation, the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option needs to be set on a DCCP socket

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   A local, unprivileged user account on the system.
*   The attacker must be able to create DCCP sockets.
*   The system must have IPV6 enabled.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `dccp_rcv_state_process` function in `net/dccp/input.c`.
*   The vulnerable code path is triggered when a DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet is received and `dccp_v6_conn_request` is called.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO option is set on a socket, because in this condition the `skb` is freed in `dccp_rcv_state_process` but a reference remains in  `ireq->pktopts`, causing a double free.
* Red Hat notes that disabling the DCCP kernel module will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited if DCCP is not already loaded.
