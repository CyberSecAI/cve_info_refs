---

#### Description

The Windows NT port has the added capability to preload DLLs defined in the inherited global local environment variable `PPSAPI_DLLS`. The code contained within those libraries is then called from the NTPD service, usually running with elevated privileges. Depending on how securely the machine is setup and configured, if `ntpd` is configured to use the PPSAPI under Windows this can easily lead to a code injection.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page).
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p10 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)

---

#### Credit

This weakness was discovered by Cure53.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3384#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2017-02-11 06:09:14 UTC   [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3384#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2017-02-11 06:11:14 UTC  ``` Windows only, PPSAPI.  The Windows NT port has the added capability to preload DLLs defined in the inherited global local environment variable PPSAPI_DLLS. The code contained within those libraries is then called from the NTPD service, usually running with elevated privileges. Depending on how securely the setup of the respective machine is configured, this can easily lead to an injection of code similar but not equivalent to LD_PRELOAD on the UNIX-like operating systems. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3384#c2)  Juergen Perlinger    2017-03-05 16:03:56 UTC  ``` The repo is in   psp.ntp.org:~perlinger/ntp-stable-3384  This was bigger cleanup action, as I had to drop use of the 'USE_PPSHACK' env var, too. The PPS hack will be automatically disabled on a serial line once a PPS API provider has taken over for that line.  Updating the 'instsrv' program was also a major change. It will write the loopback-ppsapi-provider as default API provider to the registry and permits passing other options to the service, too.  Review welcome. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3384#c3)  Juergen Perlinger    2017-03-08 21:36:14 UTC  ``` Brian Inglis commented on the broken VS2008/VS2013 compatibility in 'instsrv.c'. Fixed now - compiles with 2008,2013,2015 (2005 not available) ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3384#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2017-03-10 10:13:35 UTC  ``` Pearly,  Thanks for your work on this.
