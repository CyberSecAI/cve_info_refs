{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Windows NT port of NTP has the capability to preload DLLs defined in the inherited global local environment variable `PPSAPI_DLLS`. The code contained within these libraries is then called from the NTPD service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code injection vulnerability due to insecure DLL preloading."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the NTPD service (usually elevated privileges).",
    "attack_vectors": "By setting a malicious DLL in the `PPSAPI_DLLS` environment variable, which is then loaded by the vulnerable NTPD service.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to set the `PPSAPI_DLLS` environment variable before the NTP service is started. Depending on machine configuration this may or may not be trivial.",
       "more_info": "The vulnerability only affects Windows versions of ntp-4 that use the PPSAPI."
