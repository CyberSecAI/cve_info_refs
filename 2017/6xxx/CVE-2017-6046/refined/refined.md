Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-6046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficiently protected credentials during transmission, which makes them vulnerable to sniffing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522):** Sensitive information is not adequately protected during transmission, leaving it open to being intercepted (sniffing).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information due to credential sniffing. This could potentially enable further unauthorized access or actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could use network sniffing techniques to intercept the insufficiently protected credentials transmitted across the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need to have the capability to monitor network traffic, which would typically require being on the same network segment or having a privileged position on the network.
- **No user interaction:** The user does not need to perform any actions beyond using the application for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided CVSS v3 base score is 4.3 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
- The vendor has stated that this vulnerability will not be addressed.
- The vulnerability is present in Sierra Wireless AirLink Raven XE and XT devices.
