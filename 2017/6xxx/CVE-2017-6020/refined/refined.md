      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered when sending a series of dot dot slashes (../) to the vulnerable NOME parameter found on the listagem.laquis file.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Directory Traversal"

          "HTTP GET request with a crafted URI containing directory traversal sequences in the NOME parameter."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
        "additional_details": "The exploit code uses a Metasploit module to automate the process of discovering the vulnerable 'listagem.laquis' file and then sending a crafted request to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability by manipulating the `NOME` parameter. The module attempts to download an arbitrary file specified via the `FILE` option."
