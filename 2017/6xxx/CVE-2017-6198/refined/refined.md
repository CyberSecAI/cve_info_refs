  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is that Sandstorm does not have a comprehensive policy to limit the amount of resource used by every apps run on it. Specifically, it only limits the maximum number of files opened by each process, but not the number of subprocesses and storage usage.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Resource exhaustion due to lack of limitations on subprocesses and storage usage.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can crash the server by uploading a malicious app that uses a fork bomb or consumes huge storage space.",
  "Attack vectors": "Uploading a malicious app to the Sandstorm platform.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to upload and install apps on the Sandstorm platform."
