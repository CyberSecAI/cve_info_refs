Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located in the K12 file parser within Wireshark's libwiretap library. A specially crafted (fuzzed) K12 file can trigger an invalid read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is an invalid memory read within the K12 file parsing code. This suggests a lack of proper bounds checking or validation within the parser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash, leading to a denial-of-service. It's possible that other impacts could occur, but the provided text only mentions crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**
There are two main attack vectors described:
   1.  Injecting a malformed K12 packet onto the network.
   2.  Convincing a user to open a malformed K12 packet trace file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to craft a malformed K12 file. They would also need to be in a position to inject the malformed packet on the wire or convince a user to open the malicious file with Wireshark.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Otto Airamo and Antti Levom√§ki from Forcepoint.
- The affected versions of Wireshark are 2.2.0 to 2.2.4 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.10.
- Fixed versions are 2.2.5 and 2.0.11.
- The vulnerability is present in the libwiretap component which handles capture file support.
- A sample file `k2_crash.rf5` is available that can trigger the vulnerability.
