Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) code of Cisco ASA Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of SSL/TLS packets.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed beyond the fact that it occurs while processing SSL/TLS packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a reload (restart) of the affected Cisco ASA system.
- This leads to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can trigger the vulnerability.
- Exploitation requires sending specially crafted SSL/TLS packets to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco ASA device.
- No prior authentication is required.
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic containing the malicious SSL/TLS packets to the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects various Cisco ASA devices, including physical appliances, virtual appliances, and modules for switches and routers.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the ASA processes SSL or TLS packets.
- This processing is done by various features, such as AnyConnect, Clientless SSL VPN, and the HTTP server used for management interface.
- The advisory provides commands (`show asp table socket | include SSL` and `show version`) to identify affected devices and versions.
- There are no known workarounds and Cisco has provided fixed software releases.
- The vulnerability was found internally by Cisco.
