- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An issue existed within the path validation logic for symlinks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insecure handling of symlinks within the path validation logic.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**  A maliciously crafted iBook file with a manipulated symlink could be used to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to deliver a malicious iBook to the target device. This could be done through sideloading or other means.
