Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the `customfmt` parameter of the `nfsen.php` script. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data allowing an attacker to inject shell commands.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Specifically, the application's use of `run-nfdump` with unsanitized `args` allows the injection of arbitrary shell commands.
* **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This leads to full system compromise, enabling data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
* **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to `/ossim/nfsen/nfsen.php`.
    -  The `customfmt` parameter within the POST data is used to inject shell commands
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated or possess a valid PHP session ID.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  Attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable system.
    - The attacker must be an authenticated user or have a valid PHPSESSID of an already authenticated user.
    - An attacker must also be able to send a crafted POST request to `/ossim/nfsen/nfsen.php`.

The provided exploit demonstrates sending a crafted request that includes control characters and shell commands through the `customfmt` parameter. This exploit takes advantage of a lack of input sanitization, allowing commands to be executed as root.
