Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Sandstorm did not restrict outgoing HTTP requests made by apps or during the download of app packages. This lack of restriction allowed requests to be made to localhost or private network destinations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient request validation:**  Sandstorm failed to prevent user-initiated requests from reaching internal network locations or the server's localhost.
*   **Lack of IP address filtering:** The system didn't have a mechanism to block requests to specific IP ranges, especially private and loopback addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Probing:** An attacker could use the vulnerability to probe the internal network on which the Sandstorm server is hosted.
*   **Local Service Access:** An attacker could access services exposed to localhost on the Sandstorm server itself, if any such services were present and unprotected.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If any unprotected internal services were present, the attacker could gather sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Apps:** Attackers could craft malicious apps to make requests to internal network or localhost resources.
*   **App Package Download:** Attackers could provide a malicious URL for downloading app packages, forcing the server to make a request to a location of their choice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Full User Status:** The attacker needs to be a full user of the Sandstorm server, with permission to install apps.
*   **No direct network access required**: The attacker does not need direct access to the target internal network. They can use the Sandstorm server as a proxy.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered high severity only when unprotected HTTP services are reachable by the Sandstorm server and untrusted users have access to the server.
*   Sandstorm itself does not expose any unprotected services on localhost, so the vulnerability would need to be combined with the presence of other vulnerable software or configurations in the environment.
*   The fix implemented involves an IP address blacklist, which can be configured by the server admin. The default blacklist includes standard private network address ranges.
*   The description in the provided blog from devco.re provides additional technical detail, especially concerning the attack vector utilizing the install URL.
