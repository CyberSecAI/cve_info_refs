Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the authentication module of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass local authentication.
- **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability arises when ISE is configured to use an external identity source for authentication, and it does not properly validate the authentication of external sources. This affects any external identity source supported by ISE that can provide external groups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact**: The CVSS score indicates high impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior authentication or privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco ISE device.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or user accounts before launching the attack.
- **Medium Complexity:** The attack complexity is rated as High (AC:H), suggesting the exploitation may require specific timing or conditions.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco ISE, Cisco ISE Express, and Cisco ISE Virtual Appliance running versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, or 2.1.0. Version 2.2 is not affected.
- **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability.
- **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. Specific patch versions are provided for each affected release.
- **No Public Exploitation:** Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
- **Internal Discovery:** The vulnerability was found internally by Cisco.
