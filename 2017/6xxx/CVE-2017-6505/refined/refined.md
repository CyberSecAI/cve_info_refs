Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-6505:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the USB OHCI (Open Host Controller Interface) emulation in QEMU.
*   Specifically, it occurs during the processing of an endpoint list descriptor within the `ohci_service_ed_list()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** An issue in how QEMU processes the endpoint list descriptor within the `ohci_service_ed_list()` function can lead to an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user or process can trigger the infinite loop, causing the QEMU process to hang or crash, effectively leading to a denial of service for the virtual machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest User/Process:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a malicious user or process running inside a QEMU guest virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a QEMU guest to trigger the vulnerability. This implies that the attacker has a compromised guest OS or is a malicious user with access to the guest.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how the USB OHCI emulation handles the endpoint list descriptor, which can cause an infinite loop in the `ohci_service_ed_list()` function.
*   The provided Red Hat bugzilla entry indicates the issue was not fixed (CLOSED WONTFIX).
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201704-01) lists this CVE as one of multiple vulnerabilities addressed in an updated QEMU package.
*   The Debian LTS advisory also mentions CVE-2017-6505, among a long list of other QEMU vulnerabilities, highlighting that the issue was addressed in a security update for Debian 8.
*   The upstream patch commit for this issue is `95ed56939eb2eaa4e2f349fe6dcd13ca4edfd8fb`.

This vulnerability allows for a local denial of service within the guest OS.
