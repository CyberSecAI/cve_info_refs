{
  "CVE-2017-6951": {
    "Description": "The keyring_search_aux function in security/keys/keyring.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service via a request_key system call for the \"dead\" key type.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `keyring_search_aux` function lacks a check to verify if the match function pointer exists for the requested key type, resulting in a null pointer dereference if the match pointer is null.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Lack of input validation"
     ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local, unprivileged user can trigger a kernel panic (denial of service) by calling `request_key` with the `dead` key type.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access through the `request_key` system call.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability by making a specific system call."
  }
