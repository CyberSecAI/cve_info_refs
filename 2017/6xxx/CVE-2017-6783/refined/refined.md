Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6783:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how SNMP polling is handled by Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), Email Security Appliance (ESA), and Content Security Management Appliance (SMA). Specifically, it allows an authenticated, remote attacker to access confidential information via SNMP that should only be available to an administrative user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Improper Access Control:  The system does not properly restrict access to confidential information via SNMP based on user privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to confidential information about the appliances. This information is normally restricted to administrative users. The specific nature of the disclosed information is not specified, but it could potentially aid further attacks, expose internal configurations, or provide insights into the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Access: The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- SNMP Polling: The vulnerability is triggered through SNMP polling of the appliances.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the network, though the specific type of user is not specified.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable appliances.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
- The base CVSS score is 4.3 (Medium severity), and the vector is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
- There are no known public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds available; upgrading to a fixed software release is the recommended solution.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
