Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-6758:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the web framework of Cisco Unified Communications Manager. This allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. This means an attacker can manipulate file paths to access files and directories outside of the intended web root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker can access arbitrary files within the web root directory structure of the affected device.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** The vulnerability has a low confidentiality impact. While it allows access to files, it doesn't lead to changes to data or denial of service, according to the CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the exploit to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the Cisco Unified Communications Manager system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.

**Additional Details:**
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
- **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability besides patching.
- **No Public Exploits:** Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public exploits or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-6758 is a directory traversal vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager that allows an authenticated remote attacker to access arbitrary files within the web root directory. The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and have network access. The impact is primarily on confidentiality, as attackers can read sensitive files.
