The provided content is related to CVE-2017-6030.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Predictable value range from previous values

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Predictable TCP initial sequence numbers (CVE-2017-6030):** The Modicon PLCs generate TCP initial sequence numbers that are insufficiently random, allowing attackers to predict them based on previous values.
*  **Use of insufficiently random values (CVE-2017-6026):** Session numbers generated by the web application lack sufficient randomization and are shared between multiple users
*   **Insufficiently protected credentials (CVE-2017-6028):** Login credentials are sent over the network using Base64 encoding making them susceptible to sniffing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Predictable TCP initial sequence numbers:** An attacker can spoof or disrupt TCP connections.
*   **Use of insufficiently random values:** Attackers may compromise a current user session
*   **Insufficiently protected credentials:** Attackers can sniff credentials and gain unauthorized access to the web application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Predictable TCP initial sequence numbers:** Remote network-based attack
*   **Use of insufficiently random values:** Remote network-based attack
*   **Insufficiently protected credentials:** Remote network-based attack (sniffing network traffic)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **All vulnerabilities:** Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable PLC. Low skill level is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
