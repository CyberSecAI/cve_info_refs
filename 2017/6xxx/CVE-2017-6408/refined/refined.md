The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Veritas NetBackup, NetBackup Appliance, and Veritas Access. One of these vulnerabilities is CVE-2017-6408.

**CVE-2017-6408**

*   **Root Cause:** A local privilege escalation race condition exists in the `pbx_exchange` component.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `pbx_exchange` process creates sockets and then changes their permissions to restrict access to root processes. There is a window of time between socket creation and permission change where any unprivileged local process can connect to the socket and impersonate a legitimate component.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this race condition to gain elevated privileges by impersonating a legitimate component.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A local, unprivileged attacker can exploit the race condition by connecting to the socket before its permissions are changed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a local unprivileged user on the system.
