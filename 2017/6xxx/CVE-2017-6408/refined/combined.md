### Comments

* Beginning with Veritas Access 7.2, Access includes a version of the NetBackup client, therefore vulnerabilities that affect that component also affect Access.
* Veritas Resiliency Platform (VRP) 2.1 and InfoMap Agent 1.0 both include components of NetBackup, however neither is affected by any of these vulnerabilities.
* This advisory will be updated as fixes become available for the various affected products.

### Issues

#### Issue #1

Privileged remote command execution on NetBackup Server and Client.

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6407](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6407)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.9 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

A local user on a NetBackup server can execute an arbitary command on the NetBackup server or cause the server to execute an arbitrary command on a connected NetBackup client.  The command will execute with root/admin privileges.

Affected Products

* NetBackup Server and Client before 7.7.2
* NetBackup Appliance before 2.7.2

#### Issue #2

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6400](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6400)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.9 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

A local user on a NetBackup server or client can execute an arbitrary command on the local system.  The command will execute with root/admin privileges.  This is a separate issue from Issue #1 described above.

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server and Client before 7.7.2
* NetBackup Appliance before 2.7.2
* Access 7.2.1 and earlier

#### Issue #3

Denial of service affecting NetBackup server

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server 8.0 and earlier
* NetBackup Appliance 3.0 and earlier

#### Issue #4

Privileged remote command execution on NetBackup Server and Client

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6399](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6399)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.9 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

A local user on a NetBackup server can execute an arbitrary command on the NetBackup server or cause the server to execute an arbitrary command on a connected NetBackup client.  The command will execute with root/admin privileges.  This is a different issue from Issues #1 and #2 above.

Affected products:

* NetBackup Server and Client before 7.7.2
* NetBackup Appliance before 2.7.2
* Access 7.2.1 and earlier

#### Issue #5

Arbitrary privileged command execution using whitelist directory escape

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6406](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6406)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.9 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

NetBackup services can execute commands on the local system from a whitelist of directories. A local user can escape that whitelist by using one or more “../” as part of a path to execute any command on the system.

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server and Client before 7.7.2
* NetBackup Appliance before 2.7.2
* Access 7.2.1 and earlier

#### Issue #6

Local arbitrary command execution when using bpcd and bpnbat

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6401](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6401)

Severity: High

CVSS v3 Base Score: 8.8 ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

bpcd runs as root/admin and can execute any NetBackup command. bpnbat can execute any command on the local system. If bpcd is used to execute bpnbat then in combination they can be used to execute any command on the system as root/admin.

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server and Client 7.7.2 and 7.7.3 before April 2017 EEB
* NetBackup Appliance before 2.7.2 and 2.7.3 before April 2017 EEB
* Access 7.2.1 and earlier

#### Issue #7

Host name based security allows DNS spoofing.

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6405](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6405)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.0 ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

NetBackup relies on host names to ensure that it is communicating with the correct client or server. This is vulnerable to DNS spoofing.

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server and Client 8.0 and earlier
* NetBackup Appliance 3.0 and earlier
* Access 7.2.1 and earlier

#### Issue #8

Local privilege escalation race condition in pbx\_exchange

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6408](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6408)

Severity: High

CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.0 ([AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

pbx\_exchange creates sockets that any process can connect to and then changes the permissions so that only root processes can connect. In the time between creation and the permission change an unprivileged local process could connect to pbx\_exchange and impersonate a legitimate component.

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server and Client 8.0 and earlier
* NetBackup Appliance 3.0 and earlier
* Access 7.2.1 and earlier

#### Issue #9

World writable log files

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6404](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6404)

Severity: Low

CVSS v3 Base Score: 3.3 ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N))

If logging is enabled many of the log files used by NetBackup are world writable, allowing an attacker to corrupt those files.

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server and Client before 7.7
* NetBackup Appliance before 2.7

#### Issue #10

NetBackup Cloud Storage Service uses a hardcoded username and password

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6403](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6403)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 10.0 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

The NetBackup Cloud Storage Service connector uses a hardcoded username and password. An attacker using these credentials can query and modify the configuration and delete data.

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server before 8.0
* NetBackup Appliance before 3.0

#### Issue #11

Unauthenticated CORBA interfaces

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-6409](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6409)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.0 ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

Unauthenticated CORBA interfaces permit an attacker to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of NetBackup.

Affected Products:

* NetBackup Server and Client 8.0 and earlier
* NetBackup Appliance 3.0 and earlier
* Access 7.2.1 and earlier

### Questions

If you have any questions about any information in this security advisory please contact [Veritas technical support](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US.html) or your Veritas sales representative.

### Acknowledgement

Veritas would like to thank Sven Blumenstein, Xiaoran Wang and Andrew Griffiths from the Google Security Team for reporting these vulnerabilities.

### Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities
