Why is the assert statement still needed in this case?

Well, in case the code is built with DEBUG defined (as I guess [@mpruett](https://github.com/mpruett) does) the assert would fail and I didn't want to change that behavior for the main developer. Also, in the general case (when DEBUG is not defined, as most distributions build this code), the assert is already a NOP.

Posted on [February 20, 2017](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2017/02/20/audiofile-divide-by-zero-in-blockcodecreset1-blockcodec-cpp/ "5:03 pm") by [ago](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/author/ago/ "View all posts by ago")

**Description**:

[audiofile](http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile/) is a C-based library for reading and writing audio files in many common formats.

A fuzz on it discovered a division by zero.

Debian Bug     : 857651

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the audiofile library,
which may result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code
if a malformed audio file is processed.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3.6-2+deb8u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.3.6-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3.6-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your audiofile packages.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# audiofile: divide-by-zero in BlockCodec::reset1 (BlockCodec.cpp)

Posted on [February 20, 2017](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2017/02/20/audiofile-divide-by-zero-in-blockcodecreset1-blockcodec-cpp/ "5:03 pm") by [ago](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/author/ago/ "View all posts by ago")

**Description**:

[audiofile](http://www.68k.org/~michael/audiofile/) is a C-based library for reading and writing audio files in many common formats.

A fuzz on it discovered a division by zero.
