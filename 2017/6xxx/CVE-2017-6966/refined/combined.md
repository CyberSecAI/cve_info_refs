I have checked in a patch to fix it.    There were two problems here.  The first was that the target specific   relocation processing code in readelf was not checking for an invalid   symbol index in the relocation.  The second was that the code was    maintaining state across multiple invocations, resulting in the use of   a stale pointer.  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=21139#c3)  Nick Clifton    2017-02-13 14:08:25 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 21142](show_bug.cgi?id=21142 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - readelf segfault - invalid read of size 8") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=21139#c4)  Nick Clifton    2017-02-13 14:09:10 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 21143](show_bug.cgi?id=21143 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - readelf segfault - heap buffer overflow, invalid read of size 8") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=21139#c5)  Nick Clifton    2017-02-13 14:10:12 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 21144](show_bug.cgi?id=21144 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - readelf segfault - heap buffer overflow, invalid read of size 8") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=21139#c6)  Nick Clifton    2017-02-13 14:11:07 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 21145](show_bug.cgi?id=21145 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - readelf segfault - null pointer dereferencing") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=21139#c7)  Nick Clifton    2017-02-13 16:54:16 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 21136](show_bug.cgi?id=21136 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - readelf segfault - heap buffer overflow") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=21139#c8)  Thuan Pham    2017-04-13 06:06:31 UTC  ``` This is CVE-2017-6966 ``` |  |

# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201709-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.28.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.28.1** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
References for additional information.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF file, PE File, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial
of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.28.1"

```
