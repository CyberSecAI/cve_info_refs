Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web interface is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks (CWE-79). This means that the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input which is reflected back to the user, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web interface.
- If a user interacts with the crafted malicious link, the attacker's script would execute in the context of the user's browser session on the vulnerable web application
- This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web interface
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **User interaction required:** The attacker needs to entice a user of the ISE web interface to click on a malicious link to trigger the execution of the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious links containing the XSS payload.
- They also need to get the victim user to click the malicious link to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- **CVSS Score:** Base score is 4.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)
- **Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds available.
- **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability is addressed in fixed software releases, mentioned in the related Cisco Bug ID.

This detailed information is consistent with a typical reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability and provides more specific details compared to a generic CVE description.
