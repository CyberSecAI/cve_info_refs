ICS Advisory
# Schneider Electric Modicon PLCs

Last RevisedMarch 30, 2017
Alert CodeICSA-17-089-02

### **CVSS v3 7.5**

**ATTENTION:** Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.

**Vendor:** Schneider Electric

**Equipment:** Modicon PLCs

**Vulnerability:** Predictable Value Range from Previous Values, Use of Insufficiently Random Values, Insufficiently Protected Credentials

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of the Modicon M221, M241, and M251 programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are affected by a predictable value range from previous values vulnerability:

* Modicon M221, firmware versions prior to Version 1.5.0.0,
* Modicon M241, firmware versions prior to Version 4.0.5.11, and
* Modicon M251, firmware versions prior to Version 4.0.5.11.

The following versions of the Modicon M241 and M251 PLCs are affected by a use of insufficiently random values vulnerability:

* Modicon M241, firmware versions prior to Version 4.0.5.11, and
* Modicon M251, firmware versions prior to Version 4.0.5.11.

The following versions of the Modicon M241 and M251 PLCs are affected by an insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability:

* Modicon M241, all firmware versions, and
* Modicon M251, all firmware versions.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to spoof or disrupt Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections, sniff sensitive account information, and gain unauthorized access to a current web session.

## MITIGATION

Schneider Electric has released new firmware versions to address the predictable value range from previous values vulnerability and the use of insufficiently random values vulnerability, which are available through Schneider Electric’s software update tool, SoMachine, Version 4.2, and SoMachineBasic, Version 1.5. Schneider Electric has not released a product to address the insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability; however, Schneider Electric has provided compensating controls to reduce the risk of exploitation.

SoMachineBasic, Version 1.5, is available at the following location:

<http://www.schneider-electric.fr/fr/download/document/SOMBASAP15SOFT/>

Schneider Electric has provided the following compensating controls to reduce the risk of exploitation of the insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability:

* Verify that the hardware and software infrastructure that the PLCs are integrated into (along with all organizational measures and rules covering access to the infrastructure) consider the results of the hazard and risk analysis, and are implemented according to best practices and standards such as ISA/IEC 62443.
* Limit traffic on the local network with managed switches
* Where possible, avoid using Wi-Fi networks, but when Wi-Fi is essential, use only secure communications (such as WPA2 encryption)
* Do not grant [network] access to unknown computers
* When remote access is essential, use secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and ensure the remote access solution(s), as well as the remote computer(s) are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Schneider Electric has released Security Notifications SEVD-2017-075-01, SEVD-2017-075-02, and SEVD-2017-075-03, which provide additional information about the identified vulnerabilities, mitigations, and compensating controls:

<http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-075-01/>

<http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-075-02/>

<http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-075-03/>

NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT web site](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

## VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

## [PREDICTABLE VALUE RANGE FROM PREVIOUS VALUES CWE-343](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/343.html)

The affected products generate insufficiently random TCP initial sequence numbers that may allow an attacker to predict the numbers from previous values. This may allow an attacker to spoof or disrupt TCP connections.

[CVE-2017-6030](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6030) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L)).

## [USE OF INSUFFICIENTLY RANDOM VALUES CWE-330](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)

The session numbers generated by the web application are lacking randomization and are shared between several users. This may allow a current session to be compromised.

[CVE-2017-6026](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6026) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)).

## [INSUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED CREDENTIALS CWE-522](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)

Log-in credentials are sent over the network with Base64 encoding leaving them susceptible to sniffing. Sniffed credentials could then be used to log into the web application.

[CVE-2017-6028](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-6028) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

        written by tijl[dot]deneut[at]howest[dot]be

        Tested on the Schneider TM241 PLC with Firmware 4.0.2.11 & Boot 0.0.2.11.
        Firmware: https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/M241-M251+Firmware+v4.0.3.20/
        Security Note: https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2017-075-02/

        This script will calculate the website session cookie, which is static after every reboot.
        (This cookie is actually the Epoch time at PLC startup)
        The only prerequisite is that, since the reboot, a user must have been logged in.
                E.g. Administrator (with default password 'admin')
                or   USER (with default password 'USER')

		After retrieving the cookie, various website actions are possible (including a DoS).
		Sample output:
		C:\Users\admin\Desktop>SchneiderGetSession.py
		Please enter an IP [10.10.36.224]:
		This device has booted 33 times
		Cookie: 1521612584 (22/03/2018 06:09:44.014)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
