Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-6026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Use of Insufficiently Random Values:** The web application generates session numbers that lack sufficient randomization and are shared between multiple users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Session Numbers:** Due to the lack of randomization, session numbers are predictable, which can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can compromise a current user's session by predicting and using their session numbers. This grants the attacker the same level of access as the compromised user in the web application.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By compromising a valid session, an attacker can perform actions within the web application as if they were the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack targets the web interface of the Modicon PLC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Modicon PLC.
*   **No Credentials Required:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing specific user credentials. The exploit utilizes the static session cookie to access the web interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit script provided calculates the session cookie by parsing the PLC firmware log. This cookie is actually the Epoch time at PLC startup and is static after every reboot. It is sent with the HTTP request header with the name `M258_LOG`.
*   The script demonstrates how to retrieve the session cookie and then use it to send a command to the PLC to query device information.
*   The script shows how to construct a cookie to gain access to the web interface.
