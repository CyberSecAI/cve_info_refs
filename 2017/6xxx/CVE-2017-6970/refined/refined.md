  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web user has access to the NfSen IPC UNIX domain socket, which allows them to send crafted commands to NfSen Perl components.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS command injection vulnerability due to shell metacharacter injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation from web user to full root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted command through the NfSen IPC UNIX domain socket.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a web user/www-data shell access (e.g., web shell or reverse shell)."
