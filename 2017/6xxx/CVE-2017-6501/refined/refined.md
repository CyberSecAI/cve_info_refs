Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing NULL pointer check in the XCF image format decoder within ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** A specially crafted XCF file can cause the program to attempt to dereference a NULL pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference leads to a crash of the ImageMagick process, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XCF File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted XCF file to an application or service using ImageMagick for image processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable system with a malicious XCF file. This could be achieved through various means depending on the context in which ImageMagick is used (e.g., uploading a file through a web interface, processing a file received through email).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick commit `d31fec57e9dfb0516deead2053a856e3c71e9751`.
*   The fix involves adding a check for the image list before destroying the last image in the XCF coder, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.
*   The Debian bug report ([856881](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=856881)) also provides additional context, including the affected versions and the fix.
