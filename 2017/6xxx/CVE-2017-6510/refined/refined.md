Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-6510

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in Easy File Sharing FTP Server version 3.6 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the RETR command, allowing an attacker to include directory traversal sequences like `../`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to download arbitrary files from the server. This could lead to information disclosure, as sensitive files could be accessed without authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is carried out through the FTP protocol, specifically by crafting a RETR command that includes directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable FTP server. No specific privileges on the server are mentioned, suggesting a remote, unauthenticated attack is possible.

**Summary:**

The provided text describes a directory traversal vulnerability in Easy File Sharing FTP Server. An attacker can exploit this flaw by using carefully crafted RETR commands containing ".." sequences, allowing them to download files from the server that they are not supposed to access, which could lead to sensitive information exposure. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely by connecting to the vulnerable FTP server, which means no prior access to the system is required.
