Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-9838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Lack of input validation and output encoding in the Dolibarr application. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts through various parameters.
- Bypassing of anti-XSS mechanism by changing request method from POST to GET when adding a new donation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
- Allows attackers to potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting malicious URLs with XSS payloads in parameters like `leftmenu`, `type`, `month_create`, `month_start`, `month_end` on various pages (e.g., `index.php`, `box.php`, `card.php`, `list.php`).
- By changing the request method from POST to GET when adding a new donation, malicious javascript can be injected in parameters like `societe`, `lastname`, `firstname`, `address`, `zipcode`, `town`, and `email`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or form submissions.
- For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to induce a user to click a malicious link.
- For stored XSS, the attacker needs to be able to add malicious data to the system (e.g. adding a donation with malicious data).
- An authenticated user is required for the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The report explicitly mentions that the reflected XSS vulnerabilities were partially fixed in version 5.0.4. However, the stored XSS vulnerabilities are still present in the version 7.0.0, as of the date of the report.
- The content provides specific vulnerable parameters and example URLs, offering more detailed information than the typical CVE description.
