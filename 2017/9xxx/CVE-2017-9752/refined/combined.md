[PR binutils/21589](show_bug.cgi?id=21589 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap-buffer-overflow in bfd_getl64")     	* vms-alpha.c (_bfd_vms_get_value): Add an extra parameter - the     	maximum value for the ascic pointer.  Check that name processing     	does not read beyond this value.     	(_bfd_vms_slurp_etir): Add checks for attempts to read beyond the     	end of etir record. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=21589#c5)  Nick Clifton    2017-06-14 10:29:47 UTC  ``` Hi Aadamski,    Thanks for reporting this bug.  There were several places in the VMS parsing code where potential address violations could happen.  I have checked in a patch which I hope will address them all.  Cheers   Nick ``` |  |
