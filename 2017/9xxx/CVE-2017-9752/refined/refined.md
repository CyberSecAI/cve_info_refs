- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `bfd_getl64` function when processing a corrupt Alpha VMS binary. Specifically, the VMS parsing code had multiple locations where address violations could occur when reading past the end of an etir record.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow due to insufficient bounds checking in the `bfd_getl64` function and VMS parsing logic, specifically when processing the etir record.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could cause a denial-of-service or potentially execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted malicious input file.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted malicious input file (specifically, a corrupt Alpha VMS binary) with the `objdump` utility.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious input file to the `objdump` utility.
