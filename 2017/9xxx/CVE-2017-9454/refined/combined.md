# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

```
This buffer overflow is in the embedded copy of ares that will be
used unless the external alternative c-ares is used by specifying
the configure argument --with-c-ares.

It has been found with LibFuzzer from the LLVM project.

# [security] ares\_parse\_a\_reply out-of-bounds read (CVE-2017-9454)

* *From*: Gregor Jasny <gjasny@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx>
* *Date*: Sun, 6 Aug 2017 16:37:09 +0200

---

```
reSIProcate Security Advisory, August 6th, 2017

VULNERABILITY

When using the embedded version of the ares library (a C library for
asynchronous DNS requests) a maliciously crafted DNS response could
cause an out-of-bounds read within the ares_parse_a_reply function.
This happens due to a missing input length check.

INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2017-9454 to this issue.

ReSIProcate supports two different asynchronous name resolvers: An
embedded copy of the ares library or the externally provided c-ares
library.  The embedded copy will be used by default unless the user
explicitly selects the external c-ares library with the configure
argument --with-c-ares.

AFFECTED VERSIONS

This flaw exists in all reSIProcate release up and including to 1.10.2.

THE SOLUTION

In the upcoming release 1.12.0, the function will be corrected.

A patch for CVE-2017-9454 is available here:
<https://github.com/resiprocate/resiprocate/commit/d67a9ca6fd06ca65d23e313bdbad1ef4dd3aa0df>

TIME LINE

The issue was detected on July 6th, 2017 by Gregor Jasny using the LLVM
LibFuzzer implementation.

A patch was made available and merged to the master branch on July 26th,
2017.
