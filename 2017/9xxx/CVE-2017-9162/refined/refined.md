```
Root cause of vulnerability:
Signed integer overflow in the at_bitmap_init function when calculating the size of the bitmap, leading to an undersized allocation

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Signed integer overflow

Impact of exploitation:
The integer overflow causes an undersized memory allocation, which can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow when the bitmap data is loaded, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted PBM file. The input is provided via a command line argument.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PBM file as input to the autotrace program.
