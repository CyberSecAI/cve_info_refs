Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-9372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overrun in the PJSIP transaction layer. Specifically, the PJSIP RFC 2543 transaction key generation algorithm does not allocate a large enough buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow due to insufficient buffer allocation during the generation of a transaction key.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Overrunning the buffer corrupts the memory allocation table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the affected service, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted SIP packet to the affected system.
*   **Crafted SIP Packet:** The crafted packet must contain:
    *   A malformed CSeq header
    *   A Via header without a branch parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication to the system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send SIP packets to the target system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the PJSIP library, which is used by Asterisk and other software.
*   A patch has been created by the Asterisk team and accepted by PJProject maintainers.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Asterisk instances using chan_sip.
