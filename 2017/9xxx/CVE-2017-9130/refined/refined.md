**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `faacEncOpen` function in `libfaac/frame.c` of the Freeware Advanced Audio Coder (FAAC) library.
- An invalid memory read occurs within this function when processing a specially crafted WAV file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Invalid memory read leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Application crash due to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV).

**Attack Vectors:**
- A crafted WAV file is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious WAV file to the FAAC encoder.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `faac` binary with the malicious WAV file as input.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided ASAN output pinpoints the exact line of code within `libfaac/frame.c` where the crash occurs, providing specific debugging information.
- The exploit also includes a proof of concept (PoC) file named `faac_1.28_faacEncOpen_invalid_memory.wav`.
- The exploit is classified as a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability
