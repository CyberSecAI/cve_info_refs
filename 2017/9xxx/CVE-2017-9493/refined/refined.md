```text
Root cause of vulnerability: The RF4CE remote pairing mechanism on the Motorola MX011ANM set-top box lacks rate-limiting.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Forced pairing vulnerability due to lack of rate-limiting on pairing sequence attempts.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can force-pair an RF4CE remote with a target set-top box.
Attack vectors: Repeatedly transmitting the same pairing code to a vulnerable set-top box.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to transmit RF4CE signals to the target set-top box. The time required for successful forced-pairing is about two hours.
