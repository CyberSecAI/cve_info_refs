**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local access.
- An attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a high level of privileges on the local system to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory notes that this vulnerability only applies when Ampla MES uses "Simple Security" and not when configured with "Windows Integrated Security".
*   The provided CVSS v3 base score is 4.2 with a vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
