The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the autotrace version 0.31.1 software. This includes:

*   **Heap-based buffer overflows:** Occur in `input-pnm.c` (specifically `pnm_load_ascii`, `pnm_load_raw`, `pnm_load_rawpbm`), `color.c` (via `GET_COLOR`), and `input-bmp.c` (in `ReadImage`). Input files trigger these overflows when processing PNM and BMP image formats.
*   **Segmentation faults (SEGV):** Occur in `color.c` (via `GET_COLOR`), `input-pnm.c` (in `input_pnm_reader`, `pnm_load_ascii`), and `input-bmp.c` (in `ReadImage`).
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** Occurs in `input-pnm.c` within the `pnmscanner_gettoken` function.
*   **Integer overflows:** Occur in `autotrace.c` and `pxl-outline.c`, and `input-bmp.c` leading to undefined behavior.
*   **Use-after-free:** Occurs in `color.c` (via `GET_COLOR`) after freeing memory in `input-bmp.c`'s `ReadImage` function.
*   **Invalid free:** Occurs in `bitmap.c`'s `free_bitmap` function when attempting to free memory that was not allocated with `malloc()`.
*   **Negative size parameter:** Occurs in `input-tga.c` due to a negative size being passed to `memset`.

**Impact:**

*   **Memory corruption:** Heap and stack buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Segmentation faults and invalid frees can cause the program to crash.
*   **Undefined behavior:** Integer overflows can lead to unpredictable program behavior and potentially exploitable conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File processing:** All vulnerabilities are triggered by processing crafted image files (PBM, BMP, TGA).
*   **Command-line execution:** The `autotrace $FILE` command is used to trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Required Capabilities:**

*   Attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious image file to the autotrace application.
*   No special privileges are required for exploitation.

CVE-2017-9156 is specifically mentioned in the context of a segmentation fault in `pnm_load_ascii` function within `input-pnm.c`.
