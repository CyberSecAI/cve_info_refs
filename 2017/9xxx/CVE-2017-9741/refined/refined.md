CVE-2017-9741
```

- **Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution
- **Root Cause:** The `install/make-config.php` script in ProjectSend allows for remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code. This is because the `dbprefix` parameter, which is used to replace `TABLES_PREFIX` in the configuration file, is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
- **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a POST request to `install/make-config.php` with a crafted `dbprefix` parameter containing malicious PHP code.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Affected component:** install/make-config.php in ProjectSend r754
- **Weakness:** CWE-20 Improper Input Validation
