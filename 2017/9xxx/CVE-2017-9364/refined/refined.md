Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insufficient blacklist approach for file upload filtering in BigTree CMS. The application uses a regular expression (`$DisabledExtensionRegEx`) to prevent the upload of certain file extensions. This blacklist approach was incomplete.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The regular expression used to block potentially dangerous file extensions was missing  `.pht` and `.phtml`. PHP files with these extensions can be executed by the server if they are uploaded and accessed.
*   **File Upload Bypass:** Attackers could bypass the file upload restrictions by uploading files with `.pht` or `.phtml` extensions, which were not part of the blacklist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading malicious PHP files with the bypassed extensions (.pht or .phtml), attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows for the creation of a webshell, effectively granting them control of the web server and potentially the entire system.
*   **Webshell access:** With the ability to execute arbitrary code, the attacker gains the ability to run commands on the server, access sensitive data, modify the website, and potentially use it as a launchpad for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload Form:** The attacker can upload a file with a `.pht` or `.phtml` extension through the BigTree CMS file upload functionality within the admin panel. Specifically, the issue report mentions the `/admin/trees/add/` endpoint.
*   **Direct Access:**  After the file is uploaded, the attacker can access it via the webserver and execute the malicious PHP code, by visiting the `http://www.attacker.com/site/files/resources/test.pht` endpoint mentioned in the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to File Upload Functionality:** The attacker needs access to the administrative panel or a vulnerable form where file uploads are permitted.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PHP file that can be uploaded (e.g., a webshell) to achieve remote code execution.
*  **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the URL where they can access and execute their uploaded file.

**Additional notes:**

* The fix involves adding `phtml` and `pht` to the blacklist regex: `/\\.(exe|com|bat|php|rb|py|cgi|pl|sh|asp|aspx|phtml|pht)/i`
* The issue report provides a good description of the vulnerability including relevant CAPEC identifier.
