Based on the provided commit message and code diff, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the bits-per-pixel (bpp) value within the XWD decoder in FFmpeg. Specifically, the code was not correctly handling cases where the `pixdepth` and `bpp` values did not align as expected causing out of array access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The original code lacked a proper check for specific combinations of `bpp` and `pixdepth` values, particularly in the `XWD_GRAY_SCALE` case. This allows for processing invalid image data.
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The inadequate validation could lead to an out-of-bounds memory access when processing image data with an invalid bpp.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** An attacker could craft a malicious XWD file with an invalid bpp value, causing a crash in FFmpeg due to the out-of-bounds memory read. This could potentially be used in a denial-of-service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XWD File:** The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted XWD file to the FFmpeg decoder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed XWD file to an application using the vulnerable FFmpeg library.

**Technical Details:**

The fix addresses the issue by changing the condition inside the gray scale case from:
```c
if (bpp == 1 && pixdepth == 1)
```
to
```c
if (bpp == 1 && pixdepth == 1)
```
and from
```c
} else if (pixdepth == 8) {
```
to
```c
} else if (bpp == 8 && pixdepth == 8) {
```
This ensures that when processing a gray scale image, the pixel depth of 1 is only allowed with a bpp of 1 and the pixel depth of 8 is only allowed with a bpp of 8.

The commit message explicitly mentions "Fixes out of array access" and "Found-by: continuous fuzzing process".
