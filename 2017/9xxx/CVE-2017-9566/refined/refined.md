The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9566.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected iOS applications. This code is potentially derived from third-party libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation.
- Use of vulnerable third-party code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker within a close proximity (50-100 feet) can intercept the banking username and password of a user logging into the affected application.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to the user's bank account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim using the affected app.
- The attacker performs a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, intercepting the network traffic.
- The attacker needs to capture the login credentials during the authentication process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Proximity to the user (within approximately 50-100 feet).
- Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting the network traffic.
- Basic knowledge of using tools like `bettercap` to perform HTTPS sniffing and parsing POST requests.

**Additional Information:**

- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be tested using the `bettercap` tool with HTTPS sniffing enabled and the POST request parser.
- The advisory lists 44 affected iOS applications, including "FSB DeQueen Mobile Banking" by First State Bank of DeQueen (version 3.0.1) which is specifically associated with CVE-2017-9566.
- Users are strongly advised to limit or refrain from using the affected apps in public areas until a security update is released.
