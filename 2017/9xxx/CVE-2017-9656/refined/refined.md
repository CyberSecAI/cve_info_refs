Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The backend database of the Philips DoseWise Portal (DWP) application uses hard-coded credentials for a database account. This account has privileges that can affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:**  The application stores database credentials directly within the code or configuration, making them easily accessible to an attacker who can access the system files.
*   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**: Login credentials for the web application are stored in cleartext within backend system files.  This is a separate vulnerability, which is assigned CVE-2017-9654.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker could gain access to the DWP application's database.
*   The database contains Patient Health Information (PHI).
*   Compromise of patient confidentiality, system integrity, and/or system availability is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **Access to Backend Files:** An attacker would first need elevated privileges to access the web application backend system files where the hard-coded credentials are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Elevated Privileges:** The attacker must gain some level of access to the server to access the backend system files, which contains the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Network Access:** Remote network access to the vulnerable application is required for exploitation.
*   **Low Skill:** The advisory states that an attacker with low skill could exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory specifies that the DWP application is used primarily in Australia, the United States, Japan, and Europe.
*   The vulnerability is present in DWP versions 1.1.7.333 and 2.1.1.3069.
*   Philips has released a fix in version 2.1.2.3118, which replaces the authentication method to eliminate hard-coded password vulnerabilities.
*   For users of DWP 1.1.7.333, Philips will provide support to reconfigure installations to encrypt passwords.
*   Interim mitigations include implementing network security best practices and blocking port 1433 (unless a separate SQL server is used).
