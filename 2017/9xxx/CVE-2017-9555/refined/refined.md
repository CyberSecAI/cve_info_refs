- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `PixlrEditorHandler.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of user-supplied input, specifically the `image` parameter in `PixlrEditorHandler.php`, allowing injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML codes into a vulnerable version of Photo Station, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code in the context of the user's browser, session hijacking, or other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request containing the payload in the `image` parameter of `PixlrEditorHandler.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable `PixlrEditorHandler.php` endpoint. They require low privileges and user interaction is required (victim needs to click on a malicious link, or interact with the malicious payload).
