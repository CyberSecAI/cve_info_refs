Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-9756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A missing range check when decoding the LDST instruction in the `aarch64_ext_ldst_reglist` function. This function is responsible for disassembling AArch64 instructions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The lack of proper bounds checking in `aarch64_ext_ldst_reglist` allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the `objdump` utility when disassembling a crafted file, thus causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Binary File:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted AArch64 binary file to the `objdump` utility. The crafted file contains an instruction that leads to the out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted binary file to a user or a system that is using a vulnerable version of `binutils`, specifically `objdump`.
- No special privileges are needed for exploitation, as the vulnerability can be triggered by a normal user running objdump.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing using American Fuzzy Lop and AddressSanitizer.
- The vulnerable code is located in `opcodes/aarch64-dis.c`, specifically within the function `aarch64_ext_ldst_reglist`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a range check to the `aarch64_ext_ldst_reglist` function.
