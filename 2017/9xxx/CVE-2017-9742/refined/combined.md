# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201709-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.28.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.28.1** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
References for additional information.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF file, PE File, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial
of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.28.1"

```

```
Source: https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21576

I have been fuzzing objdump with American Fuzzy Lop and AddressSanitizer.

Please find attached the minimized file causing the issue ("Input") and the
ASAN report log ("Output"). Below is the reduced stacktrace with links to the
corresponding source lines on a GitHub mirror.

The command I used was `objdump -D <file>`.

Let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=21576#c0)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 17:38:21 UTC  ``` Hello there,  I have been fuzzing objdump with American Fuzzy Lop and AddressSanitizer.  Please find attached the minimized file causing the issue ("Input") and the ASAN report log ("Output"). Below is the reduced stacktrace with links to the corresponding source lines on a GitHub mirror.  The command I used was `objdump -D <file>`.  Let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.  --  Input: 2a13a720199253614962e0bb4402d98c.9149a6478708ae7cb458345e7cbc9354.min Output: 2a13a720199253614962e0bb4402d98c.9149a6478708ae7cb458345e7cbc9354.txt  Error in "print_insn_score16": global-buffer-overflow   in print_insn_score16 at opcodes/score7-dis.c:723     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/opcodes/score7-dis.c#L723>)   in s7_print_insn at opcodes/score7-dis.c:954     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/opcodes/score7-dis.c#L954>)   in disassemble_bytes at binutils/objdump.c:1864     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L1864>)   in disassemble_section at binutils/objdump.c:2309     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L2309>)   in bfd_map_over_sections at bfd/section.c:1395     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/bfd/section.c#L1395>)   in disassemble_data at binutils/objdump.c:2445     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L2445>)   in dump_bfd at binutils/objdump.c:3547     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L3547>)   in display_file at binutils/objdump.c:3714     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L3714>)   in main at binutils/objdump.c:4016     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L4016>) ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=21576#c1)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 17:38:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10098](attachment.cgi?id=10098 "testcase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10098&action=edit "testcase") testcase ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=21576#c2)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 17:39:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10099](attachment.cgi?id=10099 "report") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10099&action=edit "report") report ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=21576#c3)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 22:37:40 UTC  ``` Additional Information: The command used was `objdump -D <file>`.

[PR binutils/21576](show_bug.cgi?id=21576 "RESOLVED FIXED - global-buffer-overflow in print_insn_score16")     	* score7-dis.c (score_opcodes): Add sentinel. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=21576#c5)  Nick Clifton    2017-06-14 16:13:22 UTC  ``` Hi Aadamski,    Thanks for reporting this bug.  This time it was a good old fashioned bug.   The disassembler was expecting its opcode table to end with a NULL sentinel   but it had been omitted from the table.  I have checked in a patch to fix   this.  Cheers ``` |  |
