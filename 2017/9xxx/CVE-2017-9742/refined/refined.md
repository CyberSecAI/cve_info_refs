Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9742:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `print_insn_score16` function within the `score7-dis.c` file of the GNU Binutils project. This occurs because the disassembler's opcode table was missing a NULL sentinel, causing it to read beyond the bounds of the table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which occurs when the `print_insn_score16` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The buffer overflow can lead to a crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The `objdump` tool, when processing a specially crafted binary, will crash due to the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Binary:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious binary file that, when processed by `objdump -D`, triggers the overflow in the `print_insn_score16` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious binary that triggers the specific code path where the missing sentinel is exploited. This file is then provided to the vulnerable objdump for processing.
- The attacker has to entice a user to use the vulnerable objdump on the malicious binary.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and AddressSanitizer.
- The vulnerability is located in the `opcodes/score7-dis.c` file, specifically in the `print_insn_score16` function at line 723.
- The affected versions of Binutils are those prior to 2.28.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a NULL sentinel to the opcode table.
