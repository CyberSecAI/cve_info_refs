Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9058:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect boundary checking within the `SIZECHECK` macro located in `lib/ytnef.c` of the `libytnef` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read. The `SIZECHECK` macro fails to properly check if the current read pointer `d` plus offset `x` exceeds the allocated buffer size `size`. This allows out-of-bounds reads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a heap-based buffer over-read, potentially causing a denial-of-service (application crash) or possibly allowing for the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted TNEF file as input to the affected software. The crafted file can cause a read beyond the allocated memory boundary during parsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TNEF file that is processed by the vulnerable `libytnef` library. This could occur in scenarios where the software parses TNEF attachments or files from an untrusted source, such as email attachments or file downloads.

**Technical Details**
- The bug report from Debian includes a code snippet showing the incorrect boundary check.
   ```c
   -- #define SIZECHECK(x) { if ((((char *)d - (char *)data) + x) >  size) {  printf("Corrupted file detected at %s : %i\n", __FILE__,  __LINE__); return(-1); } }
   ++ #define SIZECHECK(x) { if ((((char *)d - (char *)data) + x) >=  size) {  printf("Corrupted file detected at %s : %i\n", __FILE__,  __LINE__); return(-1); } }
   ```
   The fix involves changing `>` to `>=` in the macro, to properly check the boundary before performing a read.
- An AddressSanitizer report shows that a heap-buffer-overflow occurred in `SwapDWord` function, which was called by `TNEFPriority`, `TNEFParse`, and `TNEFParseFile` functions.
