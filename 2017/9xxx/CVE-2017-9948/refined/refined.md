Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Microsoft Skype due to improper handling of clipboard data, specifically when copying and pasting images from a remote desktop session.
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of secure limitations or restrictions on the transmitted size and count of images via the remote session's clipboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a stack buffer overflow in the `clipboard format` function when processing data from the remote clipboard. This occurs when pasting large image data into the Skype message box.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The skype software does not properly validate the size and format of clipboard data received from a remote session.
- **MSFTEDIT.DLL Vulnerability:** The vulnerability affects the `MSFTEDIT.DLL` dynamic link library on Windows systems, indicating the issue is related to how this library handles the clipboard data within skype.
- **Bypass of Implemented Limitation:** A patch to limit the size and count of pasted images was bypassed by using the "cut" function and pasting the image raw format text value again to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Software Crash:** Exploitation can cause the Skype application to crash due to uncaught exceptions and access violations.
- **EIP Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite the EIP register of the active software process which leads to arbitrary code execution.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overwriting the active process registers, attackers can execute their own malicious code on the affected computer systems.
- **System and process compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the affected system and process.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability can potentially lead to privilege escalation.
- **Bypass of Security Measures:** The vulnerability bypasses previously implemented limitations on clipboard data handling.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a session or through local interaction. This is done by establishing an RDP connection to another system and using the shared clipboard.
- **Clipboard Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the clipboard by copying a large image from a remote session into the local Skype client.
- **"Cut and Paste" Bypass:** After a fix, the vulnerability can be triggered again by using the "cut" functionality and pasting the image again as raw text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Skype User Account:** The attacker needs a low-privilege Skype user account.
- **Remote Desktop Access:** The attacker needs the ability to establish an RDP connection to another system with a shared clipboard function with cache.
- **Clipboard Access:** The attacker needs to access and copy data from the remote desktop's clipboard (in case of a remote session exploitation scenario)
- **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any user interaction from the victim.
- **Local access:** The attacker can also prepare the cache and clipboard of a computer locally to exploit a remote party.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Skype versions 7.2, 7.35, and 7.36.
- The vulnerability was patched in Skype version 7.37.
- The vulnerability is located in the `clipboard format` function of the skype software.
- The issue affects the `MSFTEDIT.DLL` dynamic link library of the windows8 (x86) operating system.
- The "gilasterr.log" file captured internal information including loop crashes and overwrite of the eip register during exploitation.
