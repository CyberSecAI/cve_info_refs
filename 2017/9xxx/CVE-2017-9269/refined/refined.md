    "CVE-2017-9269": {
      "relates": true,
      "summary": "The vulnerability stems from libzypp's failure to properly verify GPG keys when using YUM repositories, allowing an attacker to potentially redirect victims to unsigned repositories with malicious content.",
       "root_cause": "The vulnerability is rooted in the fact that libzypp, prior to August 2018, did not enforce correct pinning of GPG keys when using YUM repositories.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect pinning of GPG keys in libzypp when dealing with YUM repositories",
        "Failure to prevent downgrading to unsigned repositories",
        "Lack of user warning when an unsigned repository is encountered"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack or a compromise a repository mirror. If successful they could silently downgrade a system to use an unsigned repository. This would then allow them to inject malicious RPM packages into the victim's system leading to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attack on network traffic",
        "Compromise of a repository mirror"
      ],
