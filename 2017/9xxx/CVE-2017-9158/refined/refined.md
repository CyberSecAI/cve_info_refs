```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The provided content details a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the pnm_load_raw function of the autotrace program. Specifically, a memory copy operation (memcpy) within pnm_load_raw causes the buffer overflow.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A read operation attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer.

Impact of exploitation:
- Program crash: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash. This could result in denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- Malicious input file: By crafting a specially crafted PBM file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to provide input: An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PBM file as input to the autotrace program.
