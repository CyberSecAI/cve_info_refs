Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9620:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `xps_encode_font_char_imp` function located in `xps/xpsfont.c`. This function is responsible for encoding font characters in XPS documents. The overflow occurs when accessing character data using a pointer `p` in the `u16` function, specifically in this line: `return (p[0] << 8) | p[1];`

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:**  The code reads 2 bytes from memory pointed to by `p` without proper bounds checking, potentially reading beyond the allocated buffer. This happens in the `u16` function which is called by `xps_encode_font_char_imp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Segmentation Fault / Crash:** The immediate impact of this heap-buffer-overflow is a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the program.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that this vulnerability could result in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process. However, this is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided bug report, which only shows a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XPS File:** A specially crafted XPS file can trigger the heap-buffer-overflow when it is processed by Ghostscript.
- The `gxps` tool is used to process this file, specifically when converting to a PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to create a malicious XPS file designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** A user would need to open or process the malicious XPS file using a vulnerable version of Ghostscript (specifically, `gxps`).

**Technical Details:**

* The crash occurs within the `u16` function in `xps/xpsfont.c` when it attempts to read memory from an invalid address.
* The backtrace shows the call stack that leads to the crash: `xps_encode_font_char_imp` -> `xps_encode_font_char` -> `xps_true_callback_encode_char` -> `pdf_encode_glyph` -> `process_plain_text` -> `pdf_text_process` -> `gs_text_process` -> `xps_flush_text_buffer` -> `xps_parse_glyphs_imp` -> `xps_parse_glyphs` -> `xps_parse_element` -> `xps_parse_fixed_page` -> `xps_read_and_process_page_part` -> `xps_process_file`
* The AddressSanitizer output shows a heap-buffer-overflow read of size 1 at a specific address which confirms the out-of-bounds read.
