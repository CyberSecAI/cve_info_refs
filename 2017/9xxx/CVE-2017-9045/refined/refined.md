{
  "CVE-2017-9045": {
    "Description": "The Google I/O 2017 application for Android does not use SSL for retrieving some information to populate the app. This would allow an MITM attacker to inject their own content into the application.",
    "Root cause": "The application retrieves data over HTTP instead of HTTPS.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure communication",
      "Lack of SSL/TLS"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to inject malicious content into the application, potentially leading to data manipulation or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack",
      "ARP spoofing",
      "DNS takeover"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the device and the server to intercept and modify the HTTP traffic. This can be achieved through techniques like ARP spoofing or DNS hijacking."
