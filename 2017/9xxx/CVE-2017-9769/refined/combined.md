        A vulnerability exists in the latest version of Razer Synapse
        (v2.20.15.1104 as of the day of disclosure) which can be leveraged
        locally by a malicious application to elevate its privileges to those of
        NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerability lies in a specific IOCTL handler
        in the rzpnk.sys driver that passes a PID specified by the user to
        ZwOpenProcess. This can be issued by an application to open a handle to
        an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and
        write memory in the specified process.

        This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the
        winlogon process (which runs as NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) and infect it by
        installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is
        then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting
        in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the
        infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the
        RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will
        check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary.

        The vulnerable software can be found here:
        https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be
        connected in order to leverage this vulnerability.

        This exploit is not opsec-safe due to the user being logged out as part
        of the exploitation process.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Razer Synapse rzpnk.sys ZwOpenProcess

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### Razer Synapse rzpnk.sys ZwOpenProcess

Disclosed
03/22/2017

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

A vulnerability exists in the latest version of Razer Synapse
(v2.20.15.1104 as of the day of disclosure) which can be leveraged
locally by a malicious application to elevate its privileges to those of
NT\_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The vulnerability lies in a specific IOCTL handler
in the rzpnk.sys driver that passes a PID specified by the user to
ZwOpenProcess. This can be issued by an application to open a handle to
an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and
write memory in the specified process.
This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the
winlogon process (which runs as NT\_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) and infect it by
installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is
then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting
in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the
infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the
RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will
check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary.
The vulnerable software can be found here:
https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be
connected in order to leverage this vulnerability.
This exploit is not opsec-safe due to the user being logged out as part
of the exploitation process.

#### Author(s)

* Spencer McIntyre

#### Platform

Windows

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/windows/local/razer_zwopenprocess.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/windows/local/razer_zwopenprocess.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/local/razer_zwopenprocess
msf exploit(razer_zwopenprocess) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(razer_zwopenprocess) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(razer_zwopenprocess) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(razer_zwopenprocess) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.
