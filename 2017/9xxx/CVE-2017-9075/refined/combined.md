                 CVE-2017-9242 CVE-2017-1000364

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-0605

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the trace subsystem.

CVE-2017-7487

    Li Qiang reported a reference counter leak in the ipxitf_ioctl
    function which may result into a use-after-free vulnerability,
    triggerable when a IPX interface is configured.

CVE-2017-7645

    Tuomas Haanpaa and Matti Kamunen from Synopsys Ltd discovered that
    the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations are vulnerable to an
    out-of-bounds memory access issue while processing arbitrarily long
    arguments sent by NFSv2/NFSv3 PRC clients, leading to a denial of
    service.

CVE-2017-7895

    Ari Kauppi from Synopsys Ltd discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3
    server implementations do not properly handle payload bounds
    checking of WRITE requests. A remote attacker with write access to a
    NFS mount can take advantage of this flaw to read chunks of
    arbitrary memory from both kernel-space and user-space.

CVE-2017-8064

    Arnd Bergmann found that the DVB-USB core misused the device
    logging system, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability, with
    unknown security impact.

CVE-2017-8890

    It was discovered that the net_csk_clone_lock() function allows a
    remote attacker to cause a double free leading to a denial of
    service or potentially have other impact.

CVE-2017-8924

    Johan Hovold found that the io_ti USB serial driver could leak
    sensitive information if a malicious USB device was connected.

CVE-2017-8925

    Johan Hovold found a reference counter leak in the omninet USB
    serial driver, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.  This
    can be triggered by a local user permitted to open tty devices.

CVE-2017-9074

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the IPv6 fragmentation
    implementation could read beyond the end of a packet buffer.  A
    local user or guest VM might be able to use this to leak sensitive
    information or to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-9075

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the SCTP/IPv6 implementation
    wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, resulting
    in a use-after-free vulnerability, a similar issue to
    CVE-2017-8890.  This can be triggered by any local user.

CVE-2017-9076 / CVE-2017-9077

    Cong Wang found that the TCP/IPv6 and DCCP/IPv6 implementations
    wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, a similar
    issue to CVE-2017-9075.

CVE-2017-9242

    Andrey Konovalov reported a packet buffer overrun in the IPv6
    implementation.  A local user could use this for denial of service
    (memory corruption; crash) and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-1000364

    The Qualys Research Labs discovered that the size of the stack guard
    page is not sufficiently large. The stack-pointer can jump over the
    guard-page and moving from the stack into another memory region
    without accessing the guard-page. In this case no page-fault
    exception is raised and the stack extends into the other memory
    region. An attacker can exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.

    The default stack gap protection is set to 256 pages and can be
    configured via the stack_guard_gap kernel parameter on the kernel
    command line.

    Further details can be found at
    <https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt>

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u1 or earlier versions before the stretch release.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

SCTP needs fixes similar to 83eaddab4378 ("ipv6/dccp: do not inherit
ipv6_mc_list from parent"), otherwise bad things can happen.

# Android Security Bulletin—October 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published October 2, 2017 | Updated October 3, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of October 05, 2017 or later
address all of these issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch
level, see [Check & update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

Android partners are notified of all issues at least a month before
publication. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical severity vulnerability in media
framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to
execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google Play Protect mitigations](#mitigations) section
for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and Google Play Protect, which improve the
security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air
update (OTA) and firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[October 2017
Pixel / Nexus Security Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2017-10-01).

## Announcements

* We have launched a new monthly
  [Pixel / Nexus Security
  Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel), which contains information on additional security
  vulnerabilities and functional improvements that are addressed on Pixel and
  Nexus devices. Android device manufacturers may choose to address these
  issues on their devices. See [Common questions and
  answers](#split) for additional information
* Security bulletin acknowledgements are now listed directly in the
  [Android Security
  Acknowledgements](/docs/security/overview/acknowledgements) page.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as
[Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect). These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through [Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect) and warns
  users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is
  especially important for users who install apps from outside of Google
  Play.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check
& update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-10-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-10-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-10-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-10-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-10-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-10-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2017-10-01 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues
  reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2017-10-05 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device / partner security bulletins, such as the
Pixel / Nexus bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android devices.
Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in
device / partner security bulletins are not
required for declaring a security patch level. Android device and chipset
manufacturers are encouraged to document the presence of other fixes on their
devices through their own security websites, such as the
[Samsung](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb),
[LGE](https://lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates.html), or
[Pixel / Nexus](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel)
security bulletins.

**7. Where are the acknowledgements for this bulletin?**

The acknowledgements for this bulletin are directly in the
[Android Security
Acknowledgements](/docs/security/overview/acknowledgements) page.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1842)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* An use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel which enables a race condition in the L2TPv3 IP Encapsulation feature. A local user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges or crash the system. (CVE-2016-10200, Important)
* A flaw was found that can be triggered in keyring\_search\_iterator in keyring.c if type->match is NULL. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges. (CVE-2017-2647, Important)
* It was found that the NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel did not properly validate layout type when processing NFSv4 pNFS LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO operands. A remote attacker could use this flaw to soft-lockup the system and thus cause denial of service. (CVE-2017-8797, Important)

This update also fixes multiple Moderate and Low impact security issues:

* CVE-2015-8839, CVE-2015-8970, CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-7042, CVE-2016-7097, CVE-2016-8645, CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-9588, CVE-2016-9806, CVE-2016-10088, CVE-2016-10147, CVE-2017-2596, CVE-2017-2671, CVE-2017-5970, CVE-2017-6001, CVE-2017-6951, CVE-2017-7187, CVE-2017-7616, CVE-2017-7889, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9074, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9075, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9076, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9077, CVE-2017-9242, CVE-2014-7970, CVE-2014-7975, CVE-2016-6213, CVE-2016-9604, CVE-2016-9685

Documentation for these issues is available from the Release Notes document linked from the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Igor Redko (Virtuozzo) and Andrey Ryabinin (Virtuozzo) for reporting CVE-2017-2647; Igor Redko (Virtuozzo) and Vasily Averin (Virtuozzo) for reporting CVE-2015-8970; Marco Grassi for reporting CVE-2016-8645; and Dmitry Vyukov (Google Inc.) for reporting CVE-2017-2596.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2077)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* An use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel which enables a race condition in the L2TPv3 IP Encapsulation feature. A local user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges or crash the system. (CVE-2016-10200, Important)
* A flaw was found that can be triggered in keyring\_search\_iterator in keyring.c if type->match is NULL. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges. (CVE-2017-2647, Important)
* It was found that the NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel did not properly validate layout type when processing NFSv4 pNFS LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO operands. A remote attacker could use this flaw to soft-lockup the system and thus cause denial of service. (CVE-2017-8797, Important)

This update also fixes multiple Moderate and Low impact security issues:

* CVE-2015-8839, CVE-2015-8970, CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-7042, CVE-2016-7097, CVE-2016-8645, CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-9588, CVE-2016-9806, CVE-2016-10088, CVE-2016-10147, CVE-2017-2596, CVE-2017-2671, CVE-2017-5970, CVE-2017-6001, CVE-2017-6951, CVE-2017-7187, CVE-2017-7616, CVE-2017-7889, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9074, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9075, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9076, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9077, CVE-2017-9242, CVE-2014-7970, CVE-2014-7975, CVE-2016-6213, CVE-2016-9604, CVE-2016-9685

SCTP needs fixes similar to [83eadda](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/83eaddab4378db256d00d295bda6ca997cd13a52) ("ipv6/dccp: do not inherit
ipv6_mc_list from parent"), otherwise bad things can happen.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1854)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, PowerPC)
* kernel: net/packet: overflow in check for priv area size (CVE-2017-7308)
* kernel: AIO interface didn't use rw\_verify\_area() for checking mandatory locking on files and size of access (CVE-2012-6701)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Null pointer dereference via keyctl (CVE-2016-8650)
* kernel: ping socket / AF\_LLC connect() sin\_family race (CVE-2017-2671)
* kernel: Race condition between multiple sys\_perf\_event\_open() calls (CVE-2017-6001)
* kernel: Incorrect error handling in the set\_mempolicy and mbind compat syscalls in mm/mempolicy.c (CVE-2017-7616)
* kernel: mm subsystem does not properly enforce the CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM protection mechanism (CVE-2017-7889)
* kernel: Double free in the inet\_csk\_clone\_lock function in net/ipv4/inet\_connection\_sock.c (CVE-2017-8890)
* kernel: net: sctp\_v6\_create\_accept\_sk function mishandles inheritance (CVE-2017-9075)
* kernel: net: IPv6 DCCP implementation mishandles inheritance (CVE-2017-9076)
* kernel: net: tcp\_v6\_syn\_recv\_sock function mishandles inheritance (CVE-2017-9077)
* kernel: memory leak when merging buffers in SCSI IO vectors (CVE-2017-12190)
* kernel: vfs: BUG in truncate\_inode\_pages\_range() and fuse client (CVE-2017-15121)
* kernel: Race condition in drivers/md/dm.c:dm\_get\_from\_kobject() allows local users to cause a denial of service (CVE-2017-18203)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in net/dccp/output.c:dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in net/sctp/sm\_make\_chunk.c:\_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting CVE-2018-3639; Vitaly Mayatskih for reporting CVE-2017-12190; and Evgenii Shatokhin (Virtuozzo Team) for reporting CVE-2018-1130. The CVE-2017-15121 issue was discovered by Miklos Szeredi (Red Hat).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2669)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel, present since v3.14-rc1 through v4.12. The race happens between threads of inotify\_handle\_event() and vfs\_rename() while running the rename operation against the same file. As a result of the race the next slab data or the slab's free list pointer can be corrupted with attacker-controlled data, which may lead to the privilege escalation. (CVE-2017-7533, Important)
* It was found that the NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel did not properly validate layout type when processing NFSv4 pNFS LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO operands. A remote attacker could use this flaw to soft-lockup the system and thus cause denial of service. (CVE-2017-8797, Important)

This update also fixes multiple Moderate and Low impact security issues:
