Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure deserialization of Java objects in the Crashplan backup server. Specifically, the server uses a custom message parser on TCP port 4282 which allows arbitrary class loading and instantiation via the `com.code42.messaging.MessageFactory`. While a whitelist mechanism `com.code42.io.C42WhitelistObjectInputStream` exists for certain deserialization contexts, this is bypassed by the custom message parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The `com.code42.messaging.MessageFactory` directly instantiates objects of classes provided within network messages without sufficient validation. This allows an attacker to load and instantiate arbitrary classes from the classpath.
*   **Arbitrary Class Loading:** The ClassMessage message allows specifying the class to load via the classloader, bypassing whitelists.
*   **Unsafe Instantiation:** The message factory instantiates the class using `type.newInstance()`, triggering constructor code without checks.
*   **Secondary Vulnerability (RMI):** The instantiation of the `org.apache.commons.ssl.rmi.DateRMI` class results in the creation of a vulnerable RMI service which in turn suffers from insecure deserialization, allowing an attacker to exploit the RMI service once instantiated via the previous vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Crashplan server by using a deserialization payload via the vulnerable RMI service.
*   **Compromise of Backup Data:** Since the backup server handles sensitive organizational data, a successful exploit could lead to a major data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Crashplan server's TCP port 4282.
*   **Crafted Messages:** The attacker sends specially crafted messages using the custom protocol on port 4282. The messages are constructed to load and instantiate a class that triggers a secondary vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must be able to send data to the server on port 4282 and then connect to the new RMI port if using the secondary vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Protocol:** The attacker must understand the custom message protocol used on port 4282 and how to trigger the instantiation of a class such as `org.apache.commons.ssl.rmi.DateRMI`.
*   **Ability to Create Java Payload:** The attacker needs to generate or modify existing deserialization payloads (like those created with Ysoserial) that work without a whitelist once the `DateRMI` service is created.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists despite the presence of a whitelist in other parts of the application.
*   The specific exploit chain found by the researchers involves the loading of the `org.apache.commons.ssl.rmi.DateRMI` class, which creates an RMI server vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
*   The vulnerability is present in Crashplan server versions 5.3.4 and 5.4.0.
*   The provided content details the steps taken by the researchers to discover the vulnerability, including the decompilation of the software.
