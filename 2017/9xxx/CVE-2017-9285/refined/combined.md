This release resolves the following security vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2017-9285
* CVE-2017-9277

#### eDirectory Does Not Filter Those Events Which Are Not Required For Your Business

*Issue:*
eDirectory does not allow you to filter those XDAS events which are not suitable for your business requirements.

*Fix:*
With this version of eDirectory, you will see a new filter option called Exclusion Filter in the Basic Events Configuration section, which helps you to select those object classes and attributes for which you do not want to get an event notification. For more information, see [Filtering eDirectory Events With Exclusion Filter](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-9/edir_admin/data/bjfc00x.html#t445ny58dri4) in the [NetIQ eDirectory Administration Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-9/edir_admin/data/bookinfo.html).

#### eDirectory Is Unable to Use Java From Userâs Computer

*Issue:*
eDirectory is unable to use the Java that is installed on your computer and bundles the supported version of Java with each version

*Fix:*
This release enhances the eDirectory Management Toolbox to use Java installed by customers on their server. Java will no longer be bundled with eDirectory 9.0 SP4 and later. You can install Oracle Java 1.8 or above and export the required environment variable(s) to run the command line client. For more information, see [Using the Command Line Client](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-9/edir_admin/data/agaye59.html) in the [NetIQ eDirectory Administration Guide.](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/edirectory-9/edir_admin/data/bookinfo.html)

#### Synchronizing NMAS Method Across Servers Fails

*Issue:*
NMAS fails to synchronize different methods across all the servers.

*Fix:*
This release updates NMAS to synchronize various methods across all the servers. NMAS is also able to download methods across all the servers after refreshing the NMAS login policy. (Bug 946883)

#### High CPU Utilization Is Observed While Searching For Group Members

*Issue:*
High CPU utilization is observed while searching for dynamic or nested groups members.

*Fix:*
Two new indexes called groupmember and memberQuery have been added in this version of eDirectory. (Bug 971733)

#### Multiple eDirectory Operations Fail Due to Duplicate Entries in nds.conf File

*Issue:*
Various eDirectory operations such as startup, upgrades etc. fail due to duplicate entries found in the nds.conf file.

*Fix:*
This release updates eDirectory to avoid creating duplicate entries. If you have duplicate entries created from the previous version of eDirectory, you must manually clean them. (Bug 1033046)

#### eDirectory Crashes While Performing Bulk Add Operation

*Issue:*
eDirectory crashes when a bulk add operation is performed through LDAP, where the container in which the object is being added does not exist.

*Fix:*
This release updates eDirectory to fix this issue. (Bug 1033639)

This release updates eDirectory to resolve this issue. (Bug 1039288)

#### set ndstrace=!M Command Sets Cache Size to 0 bytes in \_ndsdb.ini File

*Issue:*
set ndstrace=!M command is setting the cache size to 0 bytes in the \_ndsdb.ini file.
