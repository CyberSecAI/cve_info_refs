The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9778.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to GDB failing to properly detect invalid length information in DWARF debug frame FDE (Frame Description Entry) headers. Specifically, it was not checking for cases where the length was negative or caused a pointer wraparound.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer wraparound vulnerability during length calculation of FDE headers
- Inadequate validation of FDE header length

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exhaustion of GDB process's virtual memory
- Termination of the debug session.
- Malicious ELF binaries or core files can prevent gdb from debugging.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted ELF binaries or core files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or modify ELF binaries or core files to include a malformed FDE header with an invalid length field.
- The attacker needs to be able to make the victim load this malformed file into GDB.
