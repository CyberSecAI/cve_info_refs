Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-9629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** This is the primary vulnerability. The software does not properly validate the size of input data before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer.
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** Although this vulnerability is mentioned in the document, it is not directly associated with CVE-2017-9629. It is related to CVE-2017-9627.
*   **Null Pointer Deference (CWE-476):** This is also present in the software, but it is not directly associated with CVE-2017-9629. It is related to CVE-2017-9631.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflow could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a highly privileged account. This means the attacker could gain complete control over the affected system.
*   The uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability could lead to a denial of service by exhausting the memory resources.
*   The null pointer deference vulnerability could cause the logger process to crash, leading to a denial of service for logging and log-viewing functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is remote and network-based. An attacker can send malicious input over the network to trigger the stack-based buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected system. The attack can be carried out remotely and requires low skill level to exploit, as stated by the advisory. No authentication is needed.

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected product is Schneider Electric's Wonderware ArchestrA Logger, versions 2017.426.2307.1 and prior.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Andrey Zhukov of USSC and self-reported by Schneider Electric to ICS-CERT.
*   A patch (Wonderware ArchestrA Logger Security Patch v2017.517.2328.1) is available to fix the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2017-9629 is a remotely exploitable stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution on affected systems, with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8. The advisory also mentions other vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-9627 and CVE-2017-9631) in the same product, but these are distinct from CVE-2017-9629.
