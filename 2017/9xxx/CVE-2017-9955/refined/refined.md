Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-9955:

**Root Cause:**

The primary root cause is improper handling of section sizes within the `objdump` tool of GNU Binutils, leading to heap-based buffer overflows. Specifically:

1.  **`bfd/opncls.c:1833`**: The `get_build_id` function copies data into a buffer (`build_id->data`) without validating that the size of the data to be copied (`inote.descsz`) is not larger than the allocated buffer. This can result in a heap buffer overflow.
2.  **`objdump.c:1692`**: The `disassemble_bytes` function accesses an array (`data`) using an offset (`z`) that is not properly validated, potentially leading to out-of-bounds reads. This also results in a heap buffer overflow.
3. **`bfd_get_full_section_contents`**: The size of a decompressed section may be larger than the size of the entire file, which was not correctly validated previously.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Occurs in multiple locations due to insufficient size checks before copying data into buffers.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** Occurs when accessing memory using an invalid offset.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The code does not validate section sizes and note sizes, allowing attackers to provide crafted inputs that trigger buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code execution:** A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** Crashing the `objdump` tool due to heap corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed ELF files:** By crafting specially crafted ELF files with oversized sections or notes, an attacker can trigger these vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed ELF file as input to the `objdump` tool. This could be through command-line arguments or other input mechanisms.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was triggered using a custom fuzzer called `collAFL`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the 2.29 version of binutils and several commits were made to fix regressions related to the fix
* There were initial attempts to check the section size before getting its content, but this was later moved to after decompression, as the decompressed size could be bigger than the file size
* The final fix uses `bfd_malloc_and_get_section` instead of `xmalloc` followed by `bfd_get_section_contents`.
