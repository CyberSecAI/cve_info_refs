Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input during the installation process of WebsiteBaker. Specifically, the `install/save.php` script directly incorporates the `database_username`, `database_host`, and `database_password` parameters into the `config.php` file without adequate sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is code injection. The `install/save.php` script takes user-provided database connection details (`database_username`, `database_host`, `database_password`) from POST parameters and directly includes them in the generated `config.php` file. Because these parameters are not validated or sanitized, an attacker can insert malicious PHP code within these parameters. When the `config.php` is included in the application, the malicious code executes.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before incorporating it into the configuration file. This is a critical oversight that enables code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious PHP code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution. This means they can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability gives the attacker a high degree of control over the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `install/save.php` script with malicious code in the `database_username`, `database_host`, or `database_password` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable WebsiteBaker installation to send the crafted POST request.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability, as it occurs within the installation process.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in `install/save.php` of WebsiteBaker v2.10.0.
* The injected code is placed in the `config.php` file during the installation process.
* The injected code executes when the application includes the `config.php` file.
* The GitHub issue mentions the possibility of replacing other configuration parameters with malicious code.
* The CVSS score is 9.8, which is considered "Critical".
* The EPSS score of 0.683% suggests that the probability of exploitation within the next 30 days is relatively low but exists.
