The provided content describes a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS applications, including "First Citizens Bank-Mobile Banking" which is associated with CVE-2017-9577.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This issue is potentially derived from third-party code integrated into these applications.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is improper TLS certificate validation. This allows a malicious actor to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to intercept the banking username and password of the user while they log into the app.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, performed over a wireless network.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim (approximately 50-100 feet). They also need the ability to intercept and modify network traffic. The attacker needs to have tools to sniff and parse HTTPS traffic, such as bettercap, configured to capture POST requests.
