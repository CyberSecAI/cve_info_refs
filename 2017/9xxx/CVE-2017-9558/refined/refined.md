The provided content is relevant to CVE-2017-9558, as it specifically mentions the CVE ID along with the affected application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected iOS applications. This code may be derived from third-party libraries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation, potentially from third-party code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker within wireless range can silently intercept a user's banking username and password while they log into the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting network traffic within a wireless range (approximately 50-100 feet).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and analyze network traffic (using tools like bettercap).
- The attacker must have some technical skill to configure the sniffing tool and parse HTTP POST requests to capture the credentials.
