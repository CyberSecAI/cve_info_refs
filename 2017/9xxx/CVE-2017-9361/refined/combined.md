   Keep it simple; first, try to abstain from drugs when you learn about your drug test. Work out regularly and incorporate fruits and vegetables into your diet to get detoxification started. Also, avoid fatty foods since the fat-soluble THC will cling to your body.The biggest bother for cannabis consumers is a drug test. On the one hand, cannabinoids such as CBD & Delta-8 THC are legal, and researchers are on a constant quest to study their medicinal properties. But, on the other hand, they will show up on a hair drug test and mark you a druggie! Based on the sample used, five types of hair drug tests are currently in use to detect drug use or the presence of THC in your system.
