Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2017-9379:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the BigTree CMS application. Specifically, two functionalities are vulnerable: clearing 404 error logs and creating 301 redirects.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application does not validate the origin of requests for sensitive actions, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in user into unknowingly executing actions on the server.
    *   **Lack of User Rights Control:** The issue also notes that there is no user rights control, any user can do the actions of the vulnerable functionalities.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Clearing 404 Logs:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to clear the 404 error logs, potentially hindering the administrator's ability to identify and fix broken links on the site.
    *   **Creating 301 Redirects:** An attacker can create arbitrary 301 redirects, potentially redirecting users to malicious websites or performing other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The attacker crafts malicious HTML forms that, when a victim visits an attacker controlled page while logged into the BigTree CMS application, submits requests to vulnerable endpoints of the CMS.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host the malicious HTML form on a website or deliver it to the victim (e.g. via a phishing email).
    *   **Victim Requirements:** The victim must be a logged-in user of the BigTree CMS application when they visit the attacker's malicious page, and their browser must have a valid session with the vulnerable CMS.

**Technical Details from the Content:**

The provided proof-of-concept (POC) code snippets illustrate the attack:

*   **POC 1 (Clear 404s):**
    *   Creates a hidden HTML form that targets `http://www.victim.com/BigTree-CMS-4.2.18/site/index.php/admin/dashboard/vitals-statistics/404/clear/`.
    *   Includes a hidden input field with the name `clear` and a value.
    *   Uses JavaScript to automatically submit the form when the page loads.

*   **POC 2 (Create 301 Redirect):**
    *   Creates a hidden HTML form that targets `http://www.victim.com/BigTree-CMS-4.2.18/site/index.php/admin/dashboard/vitals-statistics/404/create-301/`.
    *   Includes hidden input fields with names `from` and `to`, containing the source and destination URLs for the redirect, respectively.
    *   Uses JavaScript to automatically submit the form when the page loads.

**Mitigation:**
The issue suggests implementing `verifyCSRFToken()` and `requireLevel(1)` functions. This points to the need for CSRF token validation and user privilege checks as a solution.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The report specifies that the issue affects BigTree CMS versions less than 4.2.18.
*   The reporter mentions that any user could exploit this, suggesting the lack of proper access control.
