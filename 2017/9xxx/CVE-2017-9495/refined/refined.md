- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Motorola MX011ANM set-top box includes a diagnostic display that can be activated with a specific button sequence on the RF4CE remote. When this display is active, a known script can be executed through the Remote Web Inspector, leading to arbitrary file read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  -  Unrestricted access to the Remote Web Inspector when the diagnostic display is active
  -  A known script is available that allows reading arbitrary files
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the set-top box.
- **Attack vectors**:
  -  Physical access to the set-top box to use the RF4CE remote.
  -  The Remote Web Inspector accessible via network once the diagnostic display is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - Ability to use an RF4CE remote to press a specific button sequence.
  - Network access to the set-top box.
