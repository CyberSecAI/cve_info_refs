```
 Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Signed integer overflows in `input-bmp.c` at lines 309, 314, 319, 326, 486, and 516 when processing specially crafted BMP files.
    - Heap-based buffer overflows in `color.c`, `input-bmp.c`, `input-pnm.c`, and `input-tga.c` due to insufficient bounds checking.
    - Use-after-free vulnerability in `color.c` when handling malformed BMP images
    - Invalid free in `bitmap.c` when handling TGA images
    - Negative size parameter in `input-tga.c`

 Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Heap-based buffer overflows
    - Use-after-free
    - Invalid free
    - Integer overflows
    - Negative size parameter
    
 Impact of exploitation:
    - Arbitrary code execution
    - Denial of service

 Attack vectors:
    - Processing a specially crafted image file (BMP, PBM, TGA) using the autotrace tool.

 Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Attacker must be able to provide a malicious image file to be processed by the autotrace tool.
