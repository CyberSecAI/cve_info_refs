Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):** The Schneider Electric Ampla MES software transmits sensitive information in cleartext when connecting to third-party databases. Specifically, if the connection to these databases is configured to use a SQL username and password, an attacker might be able to capture these credentials by sniffing the connection string. This is in contrast to using Windows Integrated Security, which is not vulnerable.
*   **Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326):** The Ampla MES software uses a weak password hashing algorithm when Ampla users are configured to use "Simple Security." This weakness could allow an attacker to reverse the user's password. This is in contrast to using Windows Integrated Security, which is not vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission of Credentials:** SQL usernames and passwords are transmitted without encryption when connecting to third-party databases if not using Windows Integrated Security.
*   **Weak Password Hashing:** A weak hashing algorithm is used for user passwords when configured to use "Simple Security," making password recovery easier for attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Database Credentials:** An attacker could obtain credentials used to connect to third-party databases, potentially leading to unauthorized access to and modification of data.
*   **Compromised Ampla User Credentials:** An attacker could reverse user passwords, if simple security is used, leading to unauthorized access and control of the Ampla MES system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could sniff network traffic to intercept cleartext SQL credentials when Ampla MES connects to third-party databases.
*   **Password Reversal:** An attacker could use the weak password hashing algorithm to reverse passwords, if "Simple Security" is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to sniff network traffic between the Ampla MES and third-party databases.
*   **System Access (for password reversal):** The attacker needs access to the Ampla system with the ability to access user password hashes.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory also mentions a related vulnerability, CVE-2017-9635, concerning the inadequate encryption strength of user passwords.
* The report highlights that using Windows Integrated Security mitigates both vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerability was reported by Ilya Karpov from Positive Technologies.
* The affected products are Ampla MES versions 6.4 and prior. The recommendation is to upgrade to version 6.5.
