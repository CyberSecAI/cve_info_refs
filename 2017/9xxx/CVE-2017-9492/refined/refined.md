The provided content is a security advisory that includes information about CVE-2017-9492.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of cookie flags by the application. Specifically, the HTTP cookies used by the affected modems do not implement the security flags defined in the HTTP cookie standard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is the lack of proper security flags on HTTP cookies. This leaves cookies vulnerable to attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other forms of session hijacking. Although the advisory does not explicitly state which flags are missing it indicates the `HTTP only flag` is missing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to session hijacking, where an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's account and perform actions on their behalf. The severity is labeled as low.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to be able to observe the HTTP traffic, which can be done by an attacker on the same network as the victim, or by leveraging a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to intercept or have access to the HTTP traffic between the client and the affected modems. This usually implies the attacker needs to be on the same network as the user, or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
