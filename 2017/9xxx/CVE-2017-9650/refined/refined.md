Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification when uploading add-on files (.addons or .war) via the `uploadwarfile` servlet in Automated Logic's WebCTRL and related products. This lack of proper validation allows for the upload of malicious web archive files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434):** The primary issue is the unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types, specifically .war files, which can contain executable code.
*   **Improper Authorization Access Control:** Older versions of the software (prior to 6.5) allowed an 'anonymous' user to upload and install add-ons, which should not have been permitted. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The anonymous user's ability to upload files is enabled by insecure direct object reference, bypassing authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious web archive file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the WebCTRL system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user, or even an anonymous user in older versions, can gain elevated privileges to execute arbitrary code.
*   **System Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete system access.
*   **Control System Compromise:** As this software is used for building automation, exploitation could lead to disruption and manipulation of building systems (HVAC, lighting, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the WebCTRL application, specifically the `uploadwarfile` servlet.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** The attack involves uploading a specially crafted web archive file (.war or .addons) containing malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** For versions 6.5 and later, the attacker needs valid credentials to log in. However, in versions prior to 6.5, exploitation could be performed by an anonymous user, without the need for credentials.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WebCTRL instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a Python exploit that automates the process of logging in and uploading a malicious .war file.
*   The ICS-CERT advisory notes that this is a remotely exploitable vulnerability that can be exploited with a low level of skill.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab, with the advisory ID ZSL-2017-5431.
