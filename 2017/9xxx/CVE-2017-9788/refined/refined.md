{
  "CVE-2017-9788": {
    "description": "The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The `mod_auth_digest` module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory use",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server, leading to information leakage and denial of service.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Remote",
          "Specially crafted HTTP requests"
        ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted requests to the server."
