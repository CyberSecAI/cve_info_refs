{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 900 MHz transmitter firmware includes a hard-coded, unchangeable factory-set cryptographic key. Additionally, data decryption is possible at the hardware level, indicating inadequate encryption strength.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of Hard-Coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)",
      "Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to transmit fraudulent data or perform a denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": "Adjacent network access is required for exploitation. Exploiting the vulnerability requires a high level of skill.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be in close physical proximity to the affected devices to intercept and manipulate the communications. The attacker also needs a high skill level to perform the exploitation.",
    "additional_details": "The advisory mentions that for 2.4 GHz devices, users should contact Mirion Technologies for instructions on how to configure a unique encryption key, but this may be more relevant to another CVE since the current entry is for hard coded key and weak crypto"
