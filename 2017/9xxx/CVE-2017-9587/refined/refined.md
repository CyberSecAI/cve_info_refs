The provided content discusses a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS applications for credit unions, including "PCSB BANK Mobile" (CVE-2017-9587).

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. The root cause is not detailed but suspected to be from third-party code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper TLS certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker within wireless range (50-100 feet) can intercept the victim's banking username and password while logging into the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed wirelessly. An attacker needs to be within range of the victim's device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim's device while the user is logging in. The attacker also needs a tool like `bettercap` to perform the interception by enabling HTTPS sniffing and using the "POST" request parser.
