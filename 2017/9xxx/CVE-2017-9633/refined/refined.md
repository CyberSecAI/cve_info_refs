- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. Specifically, a vulnerability in the handling of the temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to and control memory, which may lead to remote code execution on the baseband radio processor of the TCU. This could allow disabling the infotainment system of the vehicle and affect functional features of the vehicle.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is achieved by leveraging a vulnerability in the temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI). The specific method of access or interaction with the TMSI is not detailed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs adjacent network access. No specific user interaction is needed.
