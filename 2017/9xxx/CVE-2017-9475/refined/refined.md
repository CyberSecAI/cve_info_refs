{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the authentication mechanism used by XFINITY Wi-Fi hotspots, which relies solely on the MAC address of the device connecting to the network.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is the insecure authentication method that uses only the MAC address for device identification. This allows for easy MAC address spoofing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate Comcast customer, gaining free internet access and attributing their malicious activities to the impersonated customer.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is wireless. An attacker sniffs the MAC addresses of devices connected to an \"xfinitywifi\" hotspot and then configures their device to use the same MAC address.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be within wireless range of an \"xfinitywifi\" hotspot and have the ability to capture Wi-Fi traffic and spoof MAC addresses. They also need to be able to configure their device to use a spoofed MAC address."
