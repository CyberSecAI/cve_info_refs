  "CVE-2017-9725": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "A flaw was found where the kernel truncated the value used to indicate the size of a buffer which it would later become zero using an untruncated value. This can corrupt memory outside of the original allocation.",
      "Severity": "Moderate",
       "Component": "Memory subsystem"
    },
    "Root cause": "Incorrect casting during DMA buffer allocation leads to size truncation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect type conversion",
       "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
       "Malicious guest OS"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to allocate DMA buffers with specific sizes; For guest OS attack, ability to send a virtual interrupt with larger index value.",
     "Patches": [

    "Affected_versions": [
      "4.4.4",
        "5.0.2",
        "5.1.1",
        "6.0",

        "7.1.1",
        "7.1.2",
        "8.0"
       ],
   "Additional_information": [
     "The vulnerability is triggered when a DMA buffer is allocated, and the size parameter is truncated due to an incorrect casting.",
     "During clearing, an untruncated size is used to zero kernel memory, which can result in memory corruption outside the allocated buffer.",
     "In RHEL kernels, there is no direct control over the size parameter used in this function.",
     "The issue affects Linux kernel packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and MRG-2.",
     "The vulnerability was also present in Qualcomm and MediaTek components, where an attacker could trigger it to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context."
