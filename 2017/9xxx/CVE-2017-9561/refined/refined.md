The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9561.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected mobile applications. This code may have been derived from third-party components. The root cause is a failure to properly validate TLS certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to intercept the banking username and password of a user logging into the affected application. This can lead to unauthorized access to the user's bank account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Wireless interception through a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The attacker needs to be within wireless range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be within wireless range of the victim's mobile device and be able to perform a MitM attack. This can be accomplished using tools like bettercap, enabling HTTPS sniffing and using the POST request parser to capture the credentials during the login process. The attacker needs no prior modifications or access to the victim's device.
