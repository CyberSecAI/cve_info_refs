Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-9608:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference that occurs in the `dnxhd_parse` function of the `dnxhd` decoder in FFmpeg. This happens when parsing a crafted MOV file.
*   Specifically, the `ff_combine_frame` function is called with a NULL `pc->buffer` pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is the use of a potentially NULL pointer (`pc->buffer`) in the `ff_combine_frame` function, which is triggered by a crafted MOV file.
*   The `dnxhd_find_frame_end` function could return an invalid value which is then used without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the FFmpeg application, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted MOV File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted MOV file containing malformed data that triggers the vulnerable code path in the DNxHD decoder.
*   **File Processing:** An attacker needs to provide a crafted MOV file to FFmpeg for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MOV file to the FFmpeg application, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a website or other service that uses FFmpeg).
*   No specific privileges or user interaction is required other than the user running ffmpeg with the malicious file.
*   The attack can be performed remotely.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was found by Yihan Lian of Qihoo 360 GearTeam.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the `dnxhd_find_frame_end` function does not return an invalid value. This prevents the NULL pointer dereference in `ff_combine_frame`.
* The vulnerability is present in FFmpeg versions before 3.2.6 and 3.3.x before 3.3.3.
* The issue was addressed in commit `0a709e2a10b8288a0cc383547924ecfe285cef89` and `31c1c0b46a7021802c3d1d18039fca30dba5a14e`, which are cherry-picked from commit `611b35627488a8d0763e75c25ee0875c5b7987dd`.

The provided information gives a more detailed insight into the vulnerability than the official CVE description, especially the root cause with the null pointer dereference in `ff_combine_frame` and the fix in `dnxhd_find_frame_end`.
