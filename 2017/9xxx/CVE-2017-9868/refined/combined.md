Package        : mosquitto
Version        : 1.3.4-2+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7653 CVE-2017-7654 CVE-2017-9868

CVE-2017-7653

    As invalid UTF-8 strings are not correctly checked, an attacker could
    cause a denial of service to other clients by disconnecting
    them from the broker with special crafted topics.

CVE-2017-7654

    Due to a memory leak unauthenticated clients can send special crafted
    CONNECT packets which could cause a denial of service in the broker.

CVE-2017-9868

    Due to wrong file permissions local users could obtain topic
    information from the mosquitto database.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.4-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.

## Description

[![@dalmoz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1918552?v=4&size=48)](/dalmoz)[dalmoz](https://github.com/dalmoz)opened [on Jun 21, 2017](https://github.com/eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto/issues/468#issue-237676947)

mosquitto.db file is world readable. This is, obviously, leading to the possibility of every local user to read the topic database and values at any given time. (permission rw-r--r--).

A security vulnerability such as this may prove disastorous to sensitive or secret data that can be contained within it.

Mitigation will be scoping the permission scheme to a specific user, that is running the mosquitto service.

Tested on an up-to-date raspberry pi 3 with the latest release of mosquitto.
