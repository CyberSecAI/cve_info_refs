  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the `GfxState.cc` file of the poppler library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that, when opened, would cause applications using the poppler library (like Evince) to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted PDF file",
      "Opening of malicious PDF file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file and have it opened by a vulnerable application. No special privileges or remote access are explicitly mentioned, but social engineering or exploitation of other vulnerabilities may be needed."

  "additional_information": {
      "related_cves": [
        "CVE-2017-9776"
      ],
    "details": "The overflow occurs in the getColor function, where the stack variable `out`, with a size of 32 items, is written to based on a user-controllable variable `nComps` in the file `GfxState.cc`, at line `4066`. If `nComps` is larger than 32, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs. Although the values written are predictable (zeros), the overflow can crash the application.",
