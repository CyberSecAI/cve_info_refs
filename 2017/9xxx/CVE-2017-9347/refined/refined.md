Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the ROS dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, the `wmem_str_hash` function in `epan/wmem/wmem_map.c` receives a null pointer as an argument, which is declared to never be null.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash.
- Improper input validation: The ROS dissector doesn't properly handle malformed packets, which results in a null pointer being passed to `wmem_str_hash`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation of the vulnerability causes Wireshark to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed packet injection: An attacker can inject a malformed ROS packet onto the network.
- Malformed packet trace file: An attacker can convince a user to open a malicious packet capture file containing the crafted ROS packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either inject network packets or provide a crafted packet capture file to a Wireshark user.

**Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs in the `wmem_str_hash` function within `epan/wmem/wmem_map.c` at line 419.
- The call stack shows the execution path from the `dissect_idmp_tcp` function, within the ROS dissector, all the way to the crash point in `wmem_str_hash`.
- The issue is triggered when the `ros_try_string` function attempts to look up a string using a null pointer.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.12 are affected.

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark 2.2.7 and later versions are not affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by the OSS-Fuzz project.
- A proof-of-concept packet capture file that triggers the vulnerability is available.
