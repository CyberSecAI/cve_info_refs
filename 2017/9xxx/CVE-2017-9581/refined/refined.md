The provided content discusses a vulnerability affecting 44 iOS credit union applications, including the "Algonquin State Bank Mobile Banking" app which is associated with CVE-2017-9581.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the code used for TLS certificate validation within the affected applications. It is suspected that the issue originates from third-party code integrated into the applications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can intercept banking usernames and passwords when users log into the affected applications. This can lead to unauthorized access to bank accounts and potential financial loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is a MitM attack that can be carried out wirelessly.
- An attacker needs to be within range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the victim using the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic (e.g., using tools like bettercap).
- The attacker must be able to perform a MitM attack.
- The attacker needs to be able to analyze the intercepted traffic and extract login credentials.
