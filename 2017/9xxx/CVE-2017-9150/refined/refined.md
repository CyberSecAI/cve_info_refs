  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The eBPF verifier in the Linux kernel, when running in verbose mode, prints the raw 32-bit value of immediate operands in BPF_LD instructions, even after the lower half of a raw pointer has been stored in these instructions. Specifically, when a 64-bit immediate load (ldimm64) loads a map address, only the lower 32 bits of the map pointer are printed in the log.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure: The lower half of a kernel pointer is leaked to unprivileged users via the verifier log.",
      "Incomplete logging of ldimm64 instructions. Only 32 bits of the immediate value is logged, while it is a 64-bit value"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged attacker could potentially obtain the lower 32 bits of a kernel map pointer, which could aid in bypassing kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR). Although it only leaks the lower half of the pointer it still makes it easier to predict the base address of kernel data structures, which could be leveraged in other exploits. This information disclosure can be abused to enhance other attacks by bypassing ASLR.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can load a crafted eBPF program that includes map references and enable verbose mode for the verifier. By reading the verifier logs, the attacker can retrieve the lower half of the map pointer.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to load eBPF programs and enable the verbose output from the verifier, which is accessible by unprivileged users. In addition, the attacker needs to know how to construct the eBPF program to cause the vulnerable code path to be executed.",
    "additional_details": "The patch fixes two issues:\n1) It introduces a check on `env->allow_ptr_leaks`. If this is false, it will print 0 instead of the map address when the user lacks the necessary privileges.\n2) It fixes the printing of `ldimm64` instructions in the verifier log to print the full 64-bit immediate rather than just the lower 32 bits. The access is safe, as `ldimm64` instructions are verified earlier via `replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr()`.\nThe commit also mentions that relying on `kptr_restrict` is not a reliable solution for all cases which is why it was explicitly addressed in code.",
