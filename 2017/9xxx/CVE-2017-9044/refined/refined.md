Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-9044:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference occurs within the `print_symbol_for_build_attribute` function of the `readelf` utility. This function attempts to access memory at address `0x000000000004`, which is a null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference in `print_symbol_for_build_attribute`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the `readelf` utility, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted ELF file with specific structure to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to supply a specially crafted ELF file to the `readelf` utility.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs when processing notes in an ELF file where the function `print_symbol_for_build_attribute` is called with a null pointer. This was found using American Fuzzy Lop.
- The issue was discovered on a master branch of binutils as of 2017-04-12.
- The provided crash information shows the program attempting to read from address 0x000000000004, which is within the zero page, confirming a null pointer dereference.
- The vulnerability is in `readelf.c:16671`, within function `print_symbol_for_build_attribute`.
- A reproducer is available on GitHub.
