Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9463:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `user_list_backend.php` file of the Piwigo application. Specifically, the `iDisplayStart` parameter within a POST request is vulnerable to SQL injection due to inadequate sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query. This is specifically a blind, time-based SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote, authenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, email addresses, permission levels, and even the database name itself.
- **Potential for other attacks:** Although not explicitly detailed, SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to more severe attacks like data modification, privilege escalation, and even complete system takeover if not properly mitigated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network via HTTP POST requests.
- **Specifically:** The vulnerable parameter is `iDisplayStart`, located in the POST request to `admin/user_list_backend.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator-level user within the Piwigo application to access the user list feature.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs some understanding of SQL injection techniques and potentially tools like SQLmap to automate exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Piwigo version 2.9.0 and possibly prior versions.
- The identified SQL Injection is a blind, time-based, which means that the attacker is not getting direct output from the database query but has to infer the result based on the time it takes the query to execute.
- The issue was reported on June 13, 2017, with the vendor providing a fix on June 14, 2017.
- A commit was made to address this issue, which includes input parameter validation for `iDisplayStart`.
- The fix implemented checks for the `iDisplayStart` parameter using `check_input_parameter` with the pattern type `PATTERN_ID`.
