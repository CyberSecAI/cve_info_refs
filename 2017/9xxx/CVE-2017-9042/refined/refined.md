Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a signed integer overflow in `readelf.c` when processing corrupt binary files. Specifically, it occurs during a subtraction operation, where a large negative number is subtracted from a smaller positive number causing an overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Signed Integer Overflow:** The code does not properly validate the operands of a subtraction, which leads to a signed integer overflow when a large negative value is subtracted from a smaller positive value. This overflow results in an undefined value that can cause unexpected behavior, including crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The integer overflow leads to a runtime error and termination of the `readelf` program, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Binary File:** The attack is triggered by processing a specially crafted, corrupt binary file using the `readelf` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create or provide a malicious binary file that will cause the integer overflow when processed by `readelf`.
*   The attacker must entice the user to process the malicious file with `readelf`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
*   The fix for this vulnerability is in commit `7296a62a2a237f6b1ad8db8c38b090e9f592c8cf`.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `readelf.c` at line `9447:39`.
*   The affected version is `master` branch of binutils at 2017-04-12. It is noted that other versions might be affected.
*   The issue was reported by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
