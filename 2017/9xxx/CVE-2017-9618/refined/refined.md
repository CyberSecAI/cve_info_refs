Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9618:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a `memcpy-param-overlap` issue within the `xps_load_sfnt_name` function located in `xps/xpsfont.c`. This means that the source and destination memory regions provided to `memcpy` overlap. This is an undefined behavior in C and can lead to data corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is a `memcpy-param-overlap` which is a type of memory corruption bug. It arises when the source and destination regions of a `memcpy` call overlap, which results in undefined behavior that may lead to data corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided bug report shows that this issue can lead to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) and a crash. It is likely that this could lead to denial of service.
- According to the Gentoo Security Advisory, exploitation of a crafted PostScript file or PDF document using GPL Ghostscript could lead to arbitrary code execution, a denial of service, or other unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted XPS file, as demonstrated by the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) file.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that a crafted PostScript or PDF file could also be used as attack vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide the specially crafted file to a user who will then process the file using the vulnerable Ghostscript library. This can likely be accomplished by having a victim open a malicious document on their machine, for example via email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided bug report includes a stack trace showing the crash within `chunk_obj_alloc` function, and also the ASAN error message detailing the memcpy-param-overlap, confirming the vulnerability location.
- The issue was fixed with commit `3c2aebbed` in the Ghostscript repository.
- The affected versions of `app-text/ghostscript-gpl` are earlier than 9.26.
- The issue is related to processing font data within XPS documents.
