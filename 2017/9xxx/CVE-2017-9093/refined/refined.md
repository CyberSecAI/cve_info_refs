- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `my_skip_input_data_fn` function in `src/imagew-jpeg.c` attempts to skip a specified number of bytes in a JPEG file. When the requested skip size (0x8000 bytes) exceeds the actual remaining file size, the function enters an infinite loop trying to reread data from the buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Infinite loop due to insufficient bounds checking on the skip size. The function does not verify if the requested skip size exceeds the available buffer data which leads to an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A specially crafted (fuzzed) JPEG file can trigger an infinite loop, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by consuming excessive resources.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can provide a crafted JPEG image file. The vulnerability is triggered when the file is processed by the vulnerable software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input (specifically a crafted JPEG file) to the vulnerable software.
