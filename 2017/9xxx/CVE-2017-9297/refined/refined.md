**Root causes of vulnerabilities:**
The document broadly mentions the types of vulnerabilities, but doesn't specify the exact root cause of each.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*  **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** Allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data.
*   **Open Redirect:** Allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious site.
*   **RMI vulnerability:** Allows an attacker to exploit the Java Remote Method Invocation mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The document does not specify the exact impact of exploitation, but based on the vulnerability types, potential impacts can include:
* XSS: Stealing user session cookies, credentials, and performing actions on behalf of a victim.
* XXE: Reading internal files and potentially gaining remote code execution.
* Open Redirect: Phishing attacks and redirecting users to malicious pages.
* RMI: Potentially remote code execution and unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The document does not specify the exact attack vectors for each vulnerability.
*   XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploited via malicious links or by injecting malicious code into a website's input fields.
*   XXE vulnerabilities are usually exploited through the injection of malicious XML data.
*   Open redirect vulnerabilities are exploited through crafted URLs.
*   RMI vulnerabilities are exploited through network access to the RMI service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The document doesn't specify the attacker's position, but it can be assumed that:
    *   XSS would require an attacker to be able to inject malicious code, which may need authenticated access or some method of interaction with the application
    *   XXE would require an attacker to be able to send malicious XML data.
    *   Open redirect vulnerabilities would require an attacker to be able to craft a specific URL.
    *  RMI Vulnerability would require network access to the RMI service, suggesting internal network position or network access through a vulnerable service exposed to the internet.

**Fix:**

The document indicates that the vulnerabilities have been fixed in the following versions:

*   **Hitachi Device Manager:** 8.5.2-01 (Released May 29, 2017)
*   **Hitachi Tiered Storage Manager:** 8.5.2-01 (Released May 29, 2017)
*  **Hitachi Replication Manager:** 8.5.2-00 (Released April 27, 2017)
*   **Hitachi Tuning Manager:** 8.5.2-00 (Released April 27, 2017)
*  **Hitachi Global Link Manager:** 8.5.2-00 (Released April 27, 2017)
*  **Hitachi Compute Systems Manager:** 8.5.2-00 (Released April 27, 2017)
The document recommends contacting Hitachi support for details on fixed products.
