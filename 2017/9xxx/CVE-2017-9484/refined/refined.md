{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The gateway transmits a 156-byte 802.11 IPv6 multicast packet every ~4 seconds, with the source MAC address being from the l2sd0.500 network interface. This MAC address is related to the Cable Modem (CM) MAC address via a simple calculation. By sniffing Wi-Fi traffic, an attacker can discover the CM MAC.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of sensitive information (CM MAC address) via unencrypted network traffic.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can discover the CM MAC address, which can then be used to generate the SSID for the hidden home security network on the target gateway. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to the network.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sniffing Wi-Fi traffic on the channel the gateway is operating on.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be within range to sniff Wi-Fi traffic on the same channel as the target gateway."
