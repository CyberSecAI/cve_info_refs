Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-9500:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is related to "various memory handling problems and cases of missing or incomplete input sanitizing". This suggests that ImageMagick was not properly validating or managing memory when processing image files, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
*   Specifically, one issue involves an assertion failure within `profile.c` in the function `ResetImageProfileIterator`. This is triggered by a crafted file, indicating a flaw in how image profiles are handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Handling Issues:**  The code had flaws in how it managed memory, potentially leading to memory corruption.
*   **Input Sanitization:**  There were instances where the input data (image files) was not adequately checked or cleaned, making the software vulnerable to malicious inputs.
*   **Assertion Failure**: The specific bug reported in github issue #500, leads to an assertion failure in `profile.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malformed image files could cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Memory Disclosure:**  Vulnerabilities in memory handling could lead to sensitive information being exposed from the application's memory.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):**  In some scenarios, the memory handling or sanitization issues might allow for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Image Files:** The primary attack vector involves processing crafted image files. These files contain data that trigger the vulnerabilities when ImageMagick attempts to read or process them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image file to the ImageMagick application. This might involve uploading an image to a website that uses ImageMagick or tricking a user into processing such an image.

**Summary of Information from different sources:**

*   **Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4019-1):**  This advisory lists CVE-2017-9500 along with several other CVEs, stating that the issues are related to memory handling and input sanitization. It notes that these issues can lead to DoS, memory disclosure, or arbitrary code execution. It also provides fixed version information.
*   **Debian LTS Advisory (DLA 1785-1):**  This advisory also includes CVE-2017-9500 as part of a long list of vulnerabilities. It uses similar language to describe the root causes and impacts.
*   **GitHub Issue #500:**  This issue report gives a specific instance of a bug, showing a crashing assertion failure in `profile.c`. It includes a test case that can trigger this crash and mentions an attribution to ADLab of Venustech.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory information is more general, detailing that many memory handling and input sanitization issues exist. The GitHub issue provides a concrete example of a specific crash caused by an assertion failure.
*   The fix involves updating the ImageMagick package to the specified versions provided in the Debian advisories.
