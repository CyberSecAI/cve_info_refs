The provided content is relevant to CVE-2017-9564. It describes a vulnerability affecting the "Community Bankâ€™s CB2GO" iOS application, which is listed as vulnerable under CVE-2017-9564.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The issue lies in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This code may originate from third-party libraries. The specific flaw is not detailed in this document, but it mentions that further analysis of the cause will be published later.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation, which enables Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept the banking username and password of a user logging into the vulnerable application.
- This interception can be done silently and wirelessly.
- The attacker needs to be within a short range (50-100 feet) of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, where an attacker intercepts communication between the vulnerable application and the server. This is facilitated by the faulty TLS certificate validation.
- The attacker uses a tool like bettercap to perform the MITM attack by sniffing the network traffic, specifically HTTPS.
- The attacker must be on the same network as the victim and act as a MITM.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range (50-100 feet) of the victim's device.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, typically by being on the same local network and using a tool such as bettercap.
- The attacker must be able to enable HTTPS sniffing and use the POST request parser within their sniffing tool to capture the credentials.
