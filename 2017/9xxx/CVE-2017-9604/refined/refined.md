Based on the provided commit messages, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue stems from the improper handling of message signing and encryption when using the "send later" feature in KMail. The commits indicate that the application was not consistently applying the user's signing and encryption settings when scheduling a message for later delivery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Encryption/Signing:** The primary vulnerability was that messages scheduled to be sent later were not being signed and/or encrypted according to the user's preferences. This could lead to sensitive information being transmitted insecurely if the user expected these security measures to be in place.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** The inconsistency between immediate sending and sending later created a potentially exploitable weakness where users may expect the same security configuration to be applied regardless of when a message is sent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the exposure of sensitive message content. If a user believed their emails would be encrypted, but they were not, an attacker with access to the message in transit could read its contents.
- **Spoofed Messages:** If a user expected their emails to be signed, but they were not, it could be easier for an attacker to send spoofed messages that would appear to be from the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could intercept the unencrypted email in transit and read its content.
- **Spoofing:** An attacker could forge emails pretending to be from a user who expected their messages to be signed.
- **Access to Email Server:** If an attacker gained access to an email server that was storing the scheduled messages, they could read the unencrypted content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MitM:** Attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic or have access to the network infrastructure.
- **Spoofing:** The attacker needs the ability to send messages from an address similar to the victim.
- **Access to Email Server:** The attacker needs unauthorized access to the email server.

**Summary of Changes:**

The commits address the issue by:

1.  Ensuring that the "send later" feature properly utilizes the relevant plugins for signing and encryption.
2.  Explicitly applying the user's chosen security settings before the scheduled message is saved and later sent.

These changes ensure that a user's expectation of signed and/or encrypted messages will be met consistently, regardless of the timing of sending.
