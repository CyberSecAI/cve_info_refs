The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in uClibc-0.9.33.2, and it is likely that these are the vulnerabilities for CVE-2017-9728, although it is not explicitly stated.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Out-of-bounds read in `get_subexp.c`
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code increments `bkref_str_off` without checking if it goes beyond the allocated buffer (`mctx->input.valid_len`), leading to a one-byte out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the condition `bkref_str_off >= mctx->input.valid_len` is checked, but the value is used after an increment in the following line which does not have bounds check: `buf [bkref_str_off++] != buf[sl_str - 1]`
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash or potentially information disclosure due to out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Attack vectors:** By providing a crafted regular expression and input string.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the regular expression and input string used in a program using uClibc's regex functions.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Stack exhaustion due to recursive calls in `check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1` in `regexce.c`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Recursive calls within `check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1` without proper exit conditions or limits allow for a stack overflow if the depth of the recursion becomes excessive.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the program crashing from a stack overflow.
*  **Attack vectors**: By providing a crafted regular expression and input string.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the regular expression and input string used in a program using uClibc's regex functions.
