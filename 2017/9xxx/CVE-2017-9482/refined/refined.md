- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists that allows an attacker to gain a root shell on the network processor (Atom) Linux instance of a gateway. This is due to the ability to enable Telnet on the internal IP address of the NP (Atom) Linux instance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the ability to enable a Telnet server on the internal IP of the network processor. The Telnet service is accessible after being enabled and there are no mechanisms for Comcast customers to prevent access to the NP's internal IP address or control the Telnet server. Additionally, the internal IP address of the NP is accessible via routing from the LAN.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain a root shell on the network processor (Atom) Linux instance of the gateway. This allows for full control of the device and likely the network.
- **Attack vectors**:
    1.  An attacker needs the ability to launch applications on the gateway. This was addressed in Bastille Tracking Number 22 (not present in this document).
    2.  The attacker needs to send specific commands to the gateway to enable Telnet on the NP's internal IP address.
    3.  The attacker needs to route traffic to the NP's internal IP address which is normally not accessible from the LAN.
    4.  The attacker can then gain root access to the NP using the telnet server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to run code on the gateway device and be on the LAN or private Wi-Fi AP. The attacker must also know how to send specific commands to the gateway to enable Telnet.
