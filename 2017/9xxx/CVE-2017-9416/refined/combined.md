## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Jun 2, 2017](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/17394#issue-233326382)
# Security Advisory (ODOO-SA-2017-06-02-1)

## Local file disclosure

**Affects**: Odoo 8.0, 9.0,10.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Core

**Credits**: Karim Boukabbouz from IBS North Africa and Nils Hamerlinck

**References**: [CVE-2017-9416](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9416)

> #### Update 1 (2017-06-06) : clarification of "normal users" in section III:
>
> Both regular non-admin user accounts and "portal user" accounts could exploit this vulnerability.

## I. Background

The Odoo framework exposes an API to access files included within any

modules. This API is used for loading resources, images or source code.

The Odoo core includes features such as reports and menus that require

files accessed through this API. In some cases, these features allow

users or administrators to control the file paths to use.

## II. Problem Description

This file access API (tools.file\_open) did not properly sanitize the

requested file paths, and could grant access to files that did not

belong to Odoo modules.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 7.7 [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Malicious users may trick some of the components accessing this API

to request arbitrary files from the local filesystem on which Odoo is

running. At least one of these components can be used without requiring

elevated privileges (a normal user or "portal user" access is sufficient).

This could allow an attacker to read any local file that is currently

readable with the system privileges of the Odoo service.

This could include sensitive files containing passwords, etc.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any malicious use if this vulnerability yet,

but the vulnerability was publicly disclosed by a 3rd party without

coordination with Odoo S.A.

## IV. Workaround

Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can only access files readable

by the system user executing Odoo. Sensitive files might therefore be

protected by using filesystem-level permissions to block access to the

Odoo user.

It is very hard to effectively secure a system in this manner, so

applying the patch or updating is strongly recommended.

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the vulnerability was

announced.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" or "odoo", and "addons"

directories), then execute the patch command, typically:

```
       patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 8.0: [d18d606](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/d18d606a55330a6b9fd19596d8b12c4e9e0a4b57)
* 9.0: [98f5f1b](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/98f5f1b888415be018467c6646f4e05301c001c2)
* 10.0: [76cd8d2](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/76cd8d2558d2a1fc11681dbc4a134ba06fb698c0)
* 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 9.0 and 10.0.
