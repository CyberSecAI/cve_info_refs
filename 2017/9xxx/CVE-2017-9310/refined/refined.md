  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-9310",
    "description": "Qemu emulator built with the e1000e NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing data via transmit or receive descriptors, provided the initial receive/transmit descriptor head(TDH/RDH) is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer.",
    "affected_components": [
      "e1000e NIC emulation"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an infinite loop within the e1000e NIC emulation, triggered when the initial receive/transmit descriptor head is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      "Infinite loop in e1000e NIC emulation."
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance resulting in DoS.",
    "attack_vector": "A privileged user inside the guest operating system can manipulate the transmit/receive descriptor head to trigger the infinite loop in the e1000e NIC emulation.",
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Privileged user access inside the guest operating system"
