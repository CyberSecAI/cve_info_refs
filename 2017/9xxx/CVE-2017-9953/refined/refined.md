- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An invalid free operation in the `Image::printIFDStructure` function within the exiv2 library. This is due to an invalid type value being detected in the `printIFDStructure` function
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability leading to a double-free.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A crafted input can trigger the invalid free, resulting in a segmentation fault and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted input to exiv2, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered when the `exiv2` tool attempts to print the IFD structure of the crafted image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to supply the crafted input to the exiv2 library.
