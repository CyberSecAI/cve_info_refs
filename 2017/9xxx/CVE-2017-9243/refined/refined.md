{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Aries QWR-1104 Wireless-N Router's Wireless Site Survey page does not properly sanitize input, allowing for the execution of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they view the vulnerable page. This can potentially lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker creates a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot with JavaScript code embedded in the hotspot's name (SSID). When the target router scans for available networks, the malicious SSID is displayed on the router's Site Survey page and the javascript code is executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the target router, be able to create a Wi-Fi hotspot and have a basic understanding of HTML and javascript."
