RELATED: CVE-2017-9095

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The Diving Log 6.0 software is vulnerable to XXE injection due to insecure handling of XML files during the import process. Specifically, when importing data from "Subsurface" or potentially other dive log software formats that utilize XML, the application improperly parses external entities defined in the XML, leading to the vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read local files on the system where Diving Log 6.0 is installed. This can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive information.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious XML file (dive.xml) containing an XXE payload. An attacker hosts a malicious DTD file (payload.dtd) on a remote server. The victim is then tricked into importing the crafted dive.xml file into Diving Log 6.0 using the "Subsurface" import option.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious DTD file on a web server accessible to the victim's machine. The attacker also needs to craft a malicious XML file that imports the malicious DTD. The attacker needs to trick a user into importing the malicious XML file.
