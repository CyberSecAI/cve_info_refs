Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9750:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `rx_decode_opcode` function within the GNU binutils when disassembling a corrupt RX binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the `rx_decode_opcode` function, which is triggered during the disassembly process. Specifically, the issue occurs when accessing the `SCALE` and `PSCALE` arrays without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the buffer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted binary file that is processed by the `objdump` utility with the `-D` option.
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted RX binary file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious binary file to the victim, who then attempts to disassemble it using `objdump -D`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `opcodes/rx-decode.opc` file, specifically around line 288.
- The `rx_decode_opcode` function does not properly validate access to the `SCALE` and `PSCALE` arrays, resulting in the overflow.
- The issue was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and AddressSanitizer (ASAN) during fuzzing of `objdump`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding checks to validate the array access using new `GET_SCALE` and `GET_PSCALE` macros.
