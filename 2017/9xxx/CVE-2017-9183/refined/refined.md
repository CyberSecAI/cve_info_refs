Root cause of vulnerability:
A signed integer overflow occurs in `input-bmp.c` during the calculation of a memory allocation size for the bitmap image data.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Signed integer overflow: When processing a specially crafted BMP image, the multiplication of image dimensions results in a signed integer overflow, leading to a small, incorrect size being used for memory allocation.

Impact of exploitation:
- The small buffer will lead to a heap buffer overflow when the bitmap data is copied, leading to a crash.

Attack vectors:
- By supplying a specially crafted BMP file to the `autotrace` tool, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow, leading to a crash due to a heap buffer overflow.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted BMP file to the `autotrace` application.
