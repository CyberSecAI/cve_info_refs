{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An overly large note value during parsing leads to a shift exponent that is too large for the 64-bit type 'unsigned long'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of large note values resulting in a shift operation with an exponent exceeding the maximum value supported by the data type."
    ],
    "impact": "A runtime error occurs due to a shift exponent being too large for a 64-bit unsigned long type, leading to a crash. This can result in a denial of service when processing crafted ELF files.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted ELF file containing an overly large note value to the `readelf` utility.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted ELF file to the `readelf` utility, meaning that they must either have access to the system or be able to make the utility process a malicious file."
  },
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-9043"
