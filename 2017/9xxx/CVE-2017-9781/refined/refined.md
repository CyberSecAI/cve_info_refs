Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9781:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `_username` parameter when attempting authentication through the `webapi.py` interface of Check_MK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application returns the content of the `_username` parameter unencoded within an HTML error message when authentication fails, which has a content type of `text/html`. This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the error message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the error message. This injected JavaScript will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This allows an attacker to potentially perform actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites
    *   Steal sensitive information such as cookies
    *   Perform other actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `webapi.py` endpoint.
*   **_username Parameter:** The attacker injects the malicious payload within the `_username` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Check\_MK instance.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in the `webapi.py` script of the Check_MK application.
*   The specific versions affected are Check\_MK versions 1.4.0x prior to 1.4.0p6.
*   The fix was introduced in Check\_MK version 1.4.0p6.
*   The `_secret` parameter is also included in the attack URL however it is not part of the vulnerability.
