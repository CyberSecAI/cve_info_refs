    "CVE": "CVE-2017-9239",
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Exiv2 0.26. When the data structure of the structure ifd is incorrect, the program assigns pValue_ to 0x0, and the value of pValue() is 0x0. TiffImageEntry::doWriteImage will use the value of pValue() to cause a segmentation fault. To exploit this vulnerability, someone must open a crafted tiff file.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect data structure in TIFF file leads to a null pointer dereference when writing image data",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
