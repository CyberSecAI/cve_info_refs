The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9567.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This may originate from third-party code incorporated into the applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This weakness makes the applications susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can silently intercept banking usernames and passwords while a user logs into the affected application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A nearby attacker (within approximately 50-100 feet) can intercept the network traffic during the login process.
- The attack can be performed wirelessly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which may involve setting up a malicious access point or using tools like bettercap.
- The attacker needs to use a tool that can perform HTTPS sniffing and has the ability to parse POST requests to capture the credentials.

**Additional Information:**
- The article mentions using `bettercap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects 44 different credit union applications for iOS.
- The article encourages users of the affected applications to refrain from using the apps in public areas until a fix is released.
