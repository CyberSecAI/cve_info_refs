The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9583.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications, potentially originating from third-party code. The specific nature of the TLS certificate validation flaw is not detailed in this document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation leading to man-in-the-middle (MitM) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can intercept banking usernames and passwords silently during the login process.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and financial data.

**Attack vectors:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack performed by an attacker within wireless range (approximately 50-100 feet).
- The attacker intercepts the network traffic between the mobile application and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be in close proximity to the victim, within the wireless range.
- The attacker needs the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, which can be done using tools like "bettercap" with HTTPS sniffing and POST request parsing enabled.
