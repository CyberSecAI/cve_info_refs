The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9572.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. The code may be derived from third-party sources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation, potentially due to flawed third-party code.
- The vulnerability allows for the interception of network traffic, specifically login credentials, due to the lack of proper certificate verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker within wireless range (50-100 feet) can intercept the username and password of a user logging into an affected application.
- The interception is silent and can occur without the user's knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic using tools like bettercap, specifically targeting HTTPS traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within wireless range of the victim using a vulnerable application.
- The attacker requires a tool such as bettercap with HTTPS sniffing enabled, and configured to parse POST requests.

**Affected Application (from the list):**
15. “Athens State Bank Mobile Banking” by Athens State Bank, version 3.0.0 (CVE-2017–9572)

The article provides additional details regarding the attack vector, required tools, and the specific nature of the vulnerability, which involves improper TLS certificate validation and interception of login credentials through a man-in-the-middle attack.
