{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UPnP services running on the gateway serve XML files from the directory /var/IGD/. An attacker with the ability to launch applications can copy files to this directory, and then download them over HTTP.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted file write to a web-accessible directory via UPnP service, leading to arbitrary file read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the gateway's file system by copying the target file to a UPnP-accessible directory and then downloading the file using HTTP.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to be able to launch applications on the gateway. They can then use this ability to copy files to the /var/IGD/ directory, making them accessible via HTTP through the UPnP service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to launch applications on the gateway (as mentioned in 'Bastille Tracking Number 22') and be able to connect to the device's network (e.g., Xfinity Home Security Wi-Fi AP)."
