Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9671:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `blob_realloc` function in `archive.c` of the apk package manager. This function is used to resize a buffer. A size of type `int` is passed and is checked against the current size. If the requested size is less than the current size, the function returns without allocating more memory.

- When parsing a tar archive, specifically when processing a pax header, `apk_tar_parse` calls `blob_realloc` with a size derived from the pax header length. The size calculation uses the following line
  `if (blob_realloc(&pax, (paxlen + 511) & -512)) goto err_nomem;`.
    - The size is calculated using bitwise AND which could result in a small, or even zero, allocation size.

- A subsequent call to `is->read`, which can result in `gzi_read` when dealing with a gzipped tar, attempts to read a number of bytes specified by the size from the pax header (size_t, which is unsigned) into the undersized buffer. This leads to a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow due to an integer underflow on size passed to `blob_realloc` and the mismatch of signed and unsigned integer types used in size checks and reads.
- The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient size checking when allocating a buffer for pax headers.
- The code reads data from the gzipped stream using `gzi_read` into the undersized buffer, causing the overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious tar.gz file (specifically, an `APKINDEX.tar.gz`) that, when processed by apk, triggers the overflow and overwrites a function pointer on the heap. This allows the attacker to gain control of execution and execute arbitrary code (demonstrated with a `system` call in the provided description).
- A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this when `apk update` is called to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted `APKINDEX.tar.gz` file. The attacker needs to be able to inject this file, or make the user retrieve it.
-  Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack during an `apk update`. This could involve compromising a mirror, or intercepting traffic, and injecting a malicious `APKINDEX.tar.gz` file in place of a legitimate one.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject/serve a malicious `APKINDEX.tar.gz` file.
- Ability to perform a MITM attack on `apk update` traffic.
- Knowledge of the target system's memory layout for reliably controlling the execution flow through overwriting function pointers.
- Ability to cause the system to execute `apk update`.
