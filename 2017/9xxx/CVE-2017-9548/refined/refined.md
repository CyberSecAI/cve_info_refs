- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue. It arises from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when creating or editing a page, specifically in the page revision functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to properly sanitize input when a user edits a page as a "Developer" and then saves a revision. This allows a malicious user to inject client-side scripting code (JavaScript). When an "Administrator" or "Normal user" previews or restores this revision, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user with the "Developer" role injecting malicious JavaScript code into a page, which is then saved as a revision. Subsequently, the malicious script is executed when another user ("Administrator" or "Normal user") previews or restores the crafted revision.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have "Developer" privileges to edit a page and inject the malicious payload, and then another user with sufficient permissions needs to view the revision.
