  "CVE-2017-9248": {
    "Description": "A cryptographic weakness in Telerik.Web.UI.dll can be exploited to disclose encryption keys (Telerik.Web.UI.DialogParametersEncryptionKey and/or the MachineKey).",
    "Root cause": "Weak encryption implementation in Telerik.Web.UI.dll.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Cryptographic Weakness",
         "Key Disclosure",
         "Predictable Encryption",
         "Improper access control"
      ],
    "Impact": "Knowledge of the encryption keys can lead to: cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks, leak of MachineKey, compromise of the ASP.NET ViewState, and arbitrary file uploads/downloads.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending crafted requests to the Telerik Dialog Handler with manipulated parameters in the 'dp' query string parameter to identify the encryption key."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the target application, and have knowledge of the vulnerable component and its related dialog handler functionality. The attacker needs to be able to induce error messages from the DialogHandler. No authentication is needed to exploit this.",
      "Affected component": "Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX versions before R2 2017 SP1 (2017.2.621), specifically the Telerik.Web.UI.dll assembly. Includes versions 2012.3.1308 up to 2017.1.118.",
    "Additional details": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted requests to the Telerik Dialog Handler, using a base64 encoded 'dp' parameter. By manipulating this parameter and observing the server's response, the encryption key can be bruteforced.",
         "The encryption is a simple XOR with a key of fixed length (48 bytes by default).",
        "The exploit is based on an encryption oracle that allows the attacker to test possible key characters by observing a specific error message generated when the decryption fails.",
        "The provided exploit code includes a bruteforcing mechanism to discover the key character by character, by sending requests and identifying if the response included a specific error message.",
        "Once the key is recovered, the exploit can generate URLs that give access to a file manager, and arbitrary file uploads."
