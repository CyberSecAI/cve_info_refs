{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A null pointer dereference occurs when freeing a block of memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper handling of zero-length strings"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (segmentation fault)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a specific sequence of bytes (e.g., '0x27 0x5c 0xe2 0x80 0xa8 0x27 0x41') and evaluating it using jerry_eval."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to `jerry_eval`."
  },
  "resolution": "The vulnerability was fixed by not allocating memory for zero-length strings. This prevents the null pointer dereference in the `jmem_heap_free_block` function.",
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of a crafted input string, leading to a parsing error and subsequent attempt to free a literal, where the block size is accessed via a potentially null pointer."
