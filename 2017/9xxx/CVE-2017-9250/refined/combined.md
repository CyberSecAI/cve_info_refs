## Description

[![@JeffJerseyCow](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25182776?u=4f5b3cef4a464c81571cdd344d31815d22054730&v=4&size=48)](/JeffJerseyCow)[JeffJerseyCow](https://github.com/JeffJerseyCow)opened [on May 13, 2017](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/issues/1821#issue-228443030)

I've discovered a NULL pointer de-reference condition within Jerryscript.

If the bytes - "0x27 0x5c 0xe2 0x80 0xa8 0x27 0x41" are evaluated by jerry\_eval a segmentation fault will occur resulting in a denial of service.

It occurs within jmem\_heap\_free\_block when block\_p->size is de-referenced.

**Proof**

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25182776/26021655/38ac0afc-378a-11e7-865e-f74c0c951822.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25182776/26021655/38ac0afc-378a-11e7-865e-f74c0c951822.png)

The call tree is as follows (generally):

1. jerry\_eval
2. ecma\_op\_eval\_chars\_buffer
3. parser\_parse\_script
4. parser\_parse\_source
5. lexer\_next\_token (parses the source for strings and returns)
6. parser\_parse\_statements (throws a parsing error via parser\_raise\_error and returns to the parser\_parse\_source PARSER\_CATCH statement)
7. parser\_free\_literals
8. util\_free\_literal
9. jmem\_heap\_free\_block (SEGMENTATION FAULT)
