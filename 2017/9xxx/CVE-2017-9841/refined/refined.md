Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9841:

*   **Relates to CVE:** YES
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the `eval-stdin.php` file of PHPUnit. The file uses `eval('?>'.file_get_contents('php://input'));` which allows execution of arbitrary PHP code when a POST request is made to the file.
*   **Weakness:** Unauthenticated remote code execution. The use of `eval()` with `file_get_contents('php://input')` allows attacker-controlled PHP code to be executed.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise or cause a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with PHP code in the body to the `eval-stdin.php` file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `eval-stdin.php` file. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   **Affected Versions:** PHPUnit versions 4.8.19 to 4.8.27 and 5.0.10 to 5.6.2 inclusive are vulnerable. Versions from 4.8.28, 5.6.3, and 6.x are not vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:**
    1.  Remove PHPUnit from production environments using `composer install --no-dev`.
    2.  Update PHPUnit to a non-vulnerable version using `composer update`.
    3.  Apply the patch manually by replacing the contents of `eval-stdin.php` with `eval('?>' . \file_get_contents('php://stdin'));`.
    4.  Disable direct access to the `composer` packages by placing a `.htaccess` file in the `/vendor` directory with `Deny from all`.
