Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9201:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error and a floating-point exception (FPE) resulting in a value that's outside the representable range of an integer type. This occurs when processing image density information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero
- Floating-point exception
- Integer overflow or out-of-range value during a conversion from a floating-point value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The application terminates due to a runtime error, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file with invalid density values.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered in `src/imagew-cmd.c` at line 850 when calling the `imagew` command with a crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious image file to the `imageworsener` utility. This could be done by getting a user to process the file.
