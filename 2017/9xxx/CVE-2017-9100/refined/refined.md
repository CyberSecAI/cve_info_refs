- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The D-Link DIR-600M router's login page allows authentication bypass by submitting blank spaces in the password field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass due to improper input validation on the password field.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized administrative access to the router, allowing them to change settings, download/upload configurations and potentially take full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker can send a specially crafted POST request to `/login.cgi` with the username as "admin" and a password field containing more than 20 spaces.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's login page, typically accessible on the local network but potentially accessible remotely if remote administration is enabled and the router has a public IP address.
