Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an invalid read within the `getBits` function in `ImfHuf.cpp` of the OpenEXR library. This occurs when processing malformed EXR image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Invalid read of size 1 byte.
- Improper handling of malformed EXR image files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker could cause the application to crash by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted EXR image file.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although less explicitly stated, the vulnerability is described as potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user is tricked into opening a crafted EXR image file.
- The attack is remote, requiring the user to open the file but not needing physical or local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify EXR image files to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges.
- Needs to be able to deliver the malformed EXR file to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in OpenEXR version 2.2.1.
- The vulnerability affects OpenEXR versions prior to 2.2.1.
- Several sources mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution but focus mainly on the denial of service.
-  The vulnerability was discovered by Brandon Perry.
