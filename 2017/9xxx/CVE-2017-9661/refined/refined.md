Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" (CWE-427). This means the software searches for required files (specifically DLLs) in a predictable order, and an attacker can exploit this by placing a malicious DLL with the same name in a directory that the software searches before the legitimate one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path: The application loads libraries (DLLs) based on a search path, which is not properly controlled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable software. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including data theft, system compromise, denial of service, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: An attacker needs to have local access to the system or a method to place a malicious DLL in a location where it will be discovered by the vulnerable application's search path (before the valid DLL).
- User Interaction: The user of the vulnerable software is required to launch/run the application for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access is required. An attacker must be able to place the malicious DLL in a location accessible to the vulnerable application before it can be executed.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- Low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific software affected is SIMPlight SCADA software, versions 4.3.0.27 and prior.
- The vendor has not responded to requests to work with NCCIC/ICS-CERT to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
- CVSS v3 base score is 7.0 with vector string of AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
