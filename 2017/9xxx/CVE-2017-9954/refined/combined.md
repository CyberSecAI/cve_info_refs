# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201709-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.28.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.28.1** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
References for additional information.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF file, PE File, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial
of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.28.1"

```
