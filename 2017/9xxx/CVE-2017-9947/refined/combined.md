Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The APOGEE PXC Modular and Compact Series are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

The TALON TC Modular and Compact Series are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC) devices
and an integral part of the TALON Automation System.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-9946

An attacker with network access to the integrated web server (80/tcp and 443/tcp) could bypass the
authentication and download sensitive information from the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-9947

A directory traversal vulnerability could allow a remote attacker with network access to the integrated
web server (80/tcp and 443/tcp) to obtain information on the structure of the ﬁle system of the affected
devices.
