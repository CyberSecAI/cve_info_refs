Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9520:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) that occurs in the `r_config_set` function within the radare2 framework when loading a dex file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core issue lies in how `r_config_set` handles the configuration node's value. It frees the old value and then tries to use the pointer in subsequent operations. Specifically, when `r_config_set` is called it:
    1. Checks if new value equals the old value and returns if so
    2. frees old value if its not equal
    3. copies new value into `node->value` using `strdup`
    4. frees pointer `tmp` that points to old value which is a now dangling pointer

    The vulnerability happens because the `r_core_bin_set_env` function in `libr/core/cbin.c`, when setting the "anal.cpu" config option,  copies the `info->cpu` string with `strdup` and then attempts to set `r->config` to use that pointer. If `info->cpu` is NULL it uses `info->arch` instead. This newly copied pointer is then freed in `r_core_bin_set_env` after the call to `r_config_set`, resulting in a use-after-free when the configuration node is accessed later, especially if it has a digital value. The `r_core_bin_set_env` is called from within `r_core_file_do_load_for_io_plugin` which can be invoked by loading a dex file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The UAF vulnerability can lead to memory corruption. If an attacker can control the freed memory, they can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can cause a crash due to the memory access violation, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious dex file:** An attacker can craft a malicious DEX file that, when loaded, triggers the UAF in `r_config_set` during the configuration setting of `anal.cpu`.
*   **radare2 command line:** The attacker would then use the radare2 command line to load the crafted DEX file, specifically using the `-A` flag. This triggers the auto-analysis and loads the binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious dex file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted DEX file to radare2.
*   **Access to radare2:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the radare2 analysis tool with the malicious file.
*   **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges, only the ability to load the crafted file.
