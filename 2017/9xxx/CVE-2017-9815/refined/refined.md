Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a memory leak in the `_TIFFmalloc` function within `tif_unix.c` of the LibTIFF library.
*   Specifically, the leak occurs when processing a crafted TIFF file, which leads to memory being allocated but not freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The vulnerability manifests as a memory leak, where allocated memory is not properly released during TIFF file processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly processing crafted TIFF files, an attacker can cause the application to consume excessive memory, eventually leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted TIFF File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted TIFF file to an application that uses the vulnerable LibTIFF library.
*   **`tiff2pdf` tool:** The provided example shows the vulnerability can be triggered using the `tiff2pdf` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide or trick a user or system into opening/processing the crafted TIFF file.
*   No specific user privileges are required, since the vulnerability occurs within the application using the libtiff library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by ADLab of Venustech.
*   The affected version of LibTIFF is 4.0.7.
*   The bug report indicates that this is a duplicate of bug 2689 which was assigned CVE-2017-9403.
*   A test case is available on Github `https://github.com/bestshow/p0cs/blob/master/memory-leak-in-tiff2pdf-2.tif`
