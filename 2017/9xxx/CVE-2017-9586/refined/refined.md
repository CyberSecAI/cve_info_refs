The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9586.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This code may be derived from third-party components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is improper TLS certificate validation. This allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by intercepting network traffic without triggering any warnings or errors within the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to silently intercept the username and password of users logging into the affected applications. The attacker can then use the credentials to gain access to the victim's bank account.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. An attacker needs to be within wireless range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the victim's device while they are logging into the affected application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be within close proximity to the victim and needs to be capable of setting up a malicious access point to intercept the traffic.  They also need to be able to use tools like bettercap with HTTPS sniffing and a POST request parser to capture the credentials. The attacker doesn't need to modify the application itself.
