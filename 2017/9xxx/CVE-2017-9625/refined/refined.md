**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **Improper Authentication** within the EnviDAS Ultimate web application. This means the application does not properly verify the identity of users before granting access to sensitive functionalities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is that the web application lacks proper authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could view sensitive information.
*   **Settings Modification:** An attacker could modify settings of the application, potentially leading to system misconfiguration or denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the potential for an attacker to execute code remotely on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, suggesting that the attack can be carried out over a network.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory states that the vulnerability requires a low skill level to exploit, implying that it's relatively easy to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have valid credentials or authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary of Key Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Envitech Ltd. EnviDAS Ultimate (versions prior to v1.0.0.5)
*   **CVSS v3 Score:** 8.2 (High)
*   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to version v1.0.0.5 or newer, minimize network exposure, use firewalls and VPNs where needed.
