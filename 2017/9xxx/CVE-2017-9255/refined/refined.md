Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-9255:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `mp4ff_read_stsc` function within the `common/mp4ff/mp4atom.c` file of FAAD2 version 2.7. This function processes the Sample To Chunk box ('stsc') in MP4 files. The vulnerability stems from a large loop triggered by a crafted MP4 file.
*   **Weakness:** The code reads an integer value representing `stsc_entry_count` from the MP4 file and uses this value to allocate memory and to control a loop without sufficient bounds checking. A crafted file can provide a very large value for `stsc_entry_count`, resulting in a large loop and excessive CPU consumption.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack results in a denial-of-service condition due to excessive CPU consumption from the large loop.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted MP4 file to the FAAD2 decoder.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify an MP4 file and provide it as input to the FAAD2 decoder.

**Technical Details:**

The provided code snippet highlights the vulnerable code section:

```c
static int32_t mp4ff_read_stsc(mp4ff_t *f)
{
    int32_t i;

    mp4ff_read_char(f); /* version */
    mp4ff_read_int24(f); /* flags */
    f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_entry_count = mp4ff_read_int32(f);

    f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_first_chunk =
        (int32_t*)malloc(f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_entry_count*sizeof(int32_t));
    f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_samples_per_chunk =
        (int32_t*)malloc(f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_entry_count*sizeof(int32_t));
    f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_sample_desc_index =
        (int32_t*)malloc(f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_entry_count*sizeof(int32_t));

    for (i = 0; i < f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_entry_count; i++)
    {
        f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_first_chunk[i] = mp4ff_read_int32(f);
        f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_samples_per_chunk[i] = mp4ff_read_int32(f);
        f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stsc_sample_desc_index[i] = mp4ff_read_int32(f);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The code reads `stsc_entry_count` and uses this value directly in a loop and in multiple calls to `malloc`. By providing a large value for `stsc_entry_count` in a crafted MP4 file, the attacker can cause the loop to iterate a very large number of times and allocate a large amount of memory, leading to high CPU usage and a potential denial of service.
