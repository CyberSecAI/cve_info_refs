Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2017-9663, as well as other related vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2017-9663:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information. Specifically, an encryption key is stored in cleartext in memory.
*   **Weakness:** The application stores sensitive data (encryption keys) in an insecure manner.
*  **Impact:** A remote attacker could potentially access the encryption key, which could lead to unauthorized access to the application and the ability to control remote vehicle commands and access account data.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote exploitation is possible. The attacker can gain access to the memory where the key is stored.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Low skill level required to exploit.

**Other Vulnerabilities Mentioned in the Advisory:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (CVE-2017-12697):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application does not properly validate the server's identity, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure communication channel.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can intercept sensitive information exchanged between the client and the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based man-in-the-middle attack.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and server. User interaction is required, as the user has to connect to the server.

*   **Improper Authentication (CVE-2017-12695):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Inadequate authentication mechanism in the application.
    *   **Weakness:** Flawed authentication allows attackers to bypass security mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could subvert security mechanisms and reset a user account password.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs valid credentials to leverage the authentication bypass, or they are able to take advantage of a server-side debugging issue to gain access to user accounts.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected product is the Shanghai OnStar iOS Client Version 7.1.
*   The advisory mentions that GM has released mitigations, including HTTP Public Key Pinning, removal of debugging code, and that users should not root or jailbreak their phones.
*   The advisory emphasizes the importance of defensive measures, such as minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and utilizing VPNs.
