Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9969:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the plaintext storage of passwords within the IGSS Mobile application's configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Passwords (CWE-256):** The application stores user passwords in clear text within a configuration file, making them easily accessible if the file is compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains access to the configuration file can directly read the stored passwords.
- **Compromise of Credentials:** This can lead to the compromise of user accounts and unauthorized access to systems managed through the application.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The attacker could potentially use the compromised credentials to move laterally within a network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the device where the IGSS Mobile app is installed can access the plaintext passwords from the configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access to the Device:** The attacker needs to have physical or logical access to the device where the IGSS Mobile application is installed, to access the application configuration files.
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs access to the application's configuration file, which could require elevated privileges depending on the operating system and file permissions. The provided text indicates that the attacker requires high privileges to access configuration data.
