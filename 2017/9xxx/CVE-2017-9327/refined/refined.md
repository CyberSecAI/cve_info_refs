  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Sensitive data of processes managed by Cloudera Manager, such as passwords, were not properly secured by file system permissions.",

      "Insecure file permissions",
      "Exposure of sensitive information"
    ],
    "impact": "Sensitive data (such as passwords) might be exposed to users with direct access to cluster hosts due to overly-permissive local file system permissions for certain files created by Cloudera Manager. The password was also visible in the Cloudera Manager Admin Console in the configuration files for the Spark History Server process.",

      "Local access to the file system of a host managed by Cloudera Manager",
       "Access to the Cloudera Manager Admin Console"
