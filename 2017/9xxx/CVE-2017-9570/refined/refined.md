This document discusses a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS banking applications, including the "Mount Vernon Bank & Trust Mobile Banking" app, which is associated with CVE-2017-9570.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications, potentially originating from third-party code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper TLS certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can intercept banking usernames and passwords while users log into the affected application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed wirelessly, and the attacker needs to be within a close physical proximity (50-100 feet) of the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range and have the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting network traffic, using tools like bettercap. The attacker needs to be able to capture the POST request.
