Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2017-9761**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `find_eoq` function within the `libr/core/cmd.c` file of radare2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Heap out-of-bounds read

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to an invalid memory access, as evidenced by the AddressSanitizer output.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a crafted file (specifically `r2_hoobr_find_eoq` in this case) into `radare2` with the command `r2 -A r2_hoobr_find_eoq`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file that, when processed by radare2, triggers the heap out-of-bounds read in `find_eoq`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `find_eoq` function at line 1394 of `libr/core/cmd.c`, within the context of command substitution. The provided ASAN output and call stack trace clarify the execution flow leading to the vulnerability, starting from parsing a crafted input during the loading process and reaching the `find_eoq` function via command substitution (`r_core_cmd_subst_i`). The fix for this issue is present in the commit `00e8f205475332d7842d0f0d1481eeab4e83017c`, which changed the behavior of how quotes are handled in the `r_core_cmd_subst_i` function.
