Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-9852:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the existence of default passwords for user and installer accounts on SMA solar inverters that are rarely changed. Furthermore, hidden user accounts have fixed passwords across all SMA devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Default passwords for user and installer accounts
- Reused default passwords across different inverters
- Predictable installer passwords across installations by the same company
- Fixed passwords for hidden user accounts across all SMA devices
- Passwords can be easily guessed or predicted

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Compromise of affected devices and their functions
- Full control of the SMA inverter
- Potential compromise of multiple systems if one is compromised
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Escalation of privileges
- Information disclosure

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the SMA inverter is required.
- Attacks can occur over the internet if the inverter is directly attached or via NAT to the internet.
- A crafted packet sent to the correct port can be used to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the SMA inverter.
- Ability to send crafted network packets.
- No specific user interaction is required.
