- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An infinite loop occurs due to improper handling of SCCP packets where the packet size specified in the header is larger than the actual data received. The loop does not detect the end-of-file condition returned by the `read()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, specifically when reading SCCP packets. The code does not check for end-of-file when reading a specified number of bytes, leading to an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory exhaustion due to excessive message logging within the infinite loop, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted SCCP packets to an Asterisk system with the `chan_skinny` module enabled. These packets have a length in the header that is greater than the actual packet data length.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated. They need the ability to send network packets to the target Asterisk system. The system must have the SCCP protocol and the `chan_skinny` module enabled.
