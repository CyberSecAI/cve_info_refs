## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2418)

## Topic

An update for openvswitch is now available for Fast Datapath for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openvswitch (2.7.2). (BZ#1472854)

Security Fix(es):

* An unsigned int wrap around leading to a buffer over-read was found when parsing OFPT\_QUEUE\_GET\_CONFIG\_REPLY messages in Open vSwitch (OvS). An attacker could use this flaw to cause a remote DoS. (CVE-2017-9214)
* In Open vSwitch (OvS), while parsing an OpenFlow role status message there is a call to the abort() function for undefined role status reasons in the function `ofp\_print\_role\_status\_message` in `lib/ofp-print.c` that may be leveraged toward a remote DoS attack by a malicious switch. (CVE-2017-9263)
* A buffer over-read was found in the Open vSwitch (OvS) firewall implementation. This flaw can be triggered by parsing a specially crafted TCP, UDP, or IPv6 packet. A remote attack could use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). (CVE-2017-9264)
* A buffer over-read flaw was found in Open vSwitch (OvS) while parsing the group mod OpenFlow messages sent from the controller. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). (CVE-2017-9265)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1472854#c0)  Timothy Redaelli    2017-07-19 14:20:27 UTC  ``` From ovs-announce mailing list:  "Due to an issue introduced in the previous release, it is highly recommended that users of 2.7.1 upgrade."  commit 9a03615624972142e750484950d7348190d68b8b Author: Han Zhou <zhouhan> Date:   Thu Jul 13 23:44:51 2017 -0700      Revert "netdev: Fix netdev_open() to adhere to class type if given"          This reverts commit d3b8f5052292b3ba9084ffed097e90b87f2950f5.          The commit introduced a problem that "File exists" will be reported     when trying to open br0.          The operation that adds eth0 to br0 while moving IP address from     eth0 to bridge internal interface br0 reproduces this issue.          $ ip a del <ip> dev eth0; ip a add <ip> dev br0; ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth0     $ ovs-dpctl show     ...     port 1: br0 (internal: open failed (File exists))     ...          At this point restarting OVS will result in connection lost for the     node.          Reverting the change fixes the problem. Since adding physical interface     to OVS bridge is quite normal operation, the problem is more severe     than the original problem fixed by commit d3b8f5052, so revert this     before a better fix is found for the original problem.

## Topic

An update for openvswitch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

Security Fix(es):

* While parsing an OpenFlow role status message Open vSwitch (OvS), a call to the abort() function for undefined role status reasons in the function 'ofp\_print\_role\_status\_message' in 'lib/ofp-print.c' could be misused for a remote denial of service attack by a malicious switch. (CVE-2017-9263)
* A buffer over-read issue was found in Open vSwitch (OvS) which emerged while parsing the GroupMod OpenFlow messages sent from the controller. The issue could enable an attacker to cause a denial of service type of attack. (CVE-2017-9265)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1473735#c0)  Daniel Alvarez Sanchez    2017-07-21 14:19:01 UTC  ``` This bug is a follow up from [bug #1468334](show_bug.cgi?id=1468334 "CLOSED ERRATA - neutron-openvswitch-agent crashes after SIGTERM is received and openvswitch/agent are not restarted") [0].  Through the examination of the coredump submitted to it, we concluded that getifaddrs() from glibc is returning an interface with ifa_name set to NULL. When openvswitch tries to compare it through strncmp(), it will crash trying to access a NULL location.  I have submitted a patch to OVS master [1] which checks that ifa_name is not NULL prior to calling strncmp().   Versions:  glibc.x86_64                    2.17-157.el7_3.1  kernel.x86_64                   3.10.0-514.6.1.el7  Additional info: This's been observed in an OpenStack compute node using hybrid firewall (more interfaces) and ~70 VM's (with a total of ~400 interfaces). It looks like this bug comes from a different bug in glibc which shouldn't return an unnamed interface. I have filled a bug [2] but until it's confirmed/fixed I think we have to protect ourselves in OVS through [1].  [0] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1468334](show_bug.cgi?id=1468334 "CLOSED ERRATA - neutron-openvswitch-agent crashes after SIGTERM is received and openvswitch/agent are not restarted") Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): [1] <https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-dev/2017-July/335859.html> [2] <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21812>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1473735#c9)  Daniel Alvarez Sanchez    2017-08-17 13:37:15 UTC  ``` Patches:  <https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-dev/2017-July/336082.html> <https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commit/c19bf36d848cbdf755c6760fad1726c95e4377f1>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1473735#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-06 16:59:49 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1436610#c0)  Aviv Guetta    2017-03-28 10:00:22 UTC  ``` This bugzilla is opened in order to make sure we include OVS-2.5 patch [1] in RHOS 10. Description (patch):  When iterating the list of mrouters, skip any that are not on the same vlan as the multicast packet to be forwarded. This bug was causing duplicate packets when more than one mrouter was behind a trunk port.    [1] <https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/694961/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1436610#c2)  Flavio Leitner    2017-03-29 00:50:12 UTC  ``` Hi,  The patch mentioned in the [comment#0](show_bug.cgi?id=1436610#c0) is available as part of [bz#1335865](show_bug.cgi?id=1335865 "CLOSED ERRATA - [fdBeta] [RFE] Update OVS-DPDK version to OVS 2.6 and DPDK 16.11") for the fast datapath beta which is now being pushed to production due to [bz#1426237](show_bug.cgi?id=1426237) (openvswitch-2.6.1-10.git20161206.el7fdp).  The goal is to provide it as update to OSP10z if possible, so feel free to test and validate the package in the meantime.  Just note that for DPDK users upgrading from OVS 2.5 to OVS 2.6 requires additional OSP support/changes. If that's the case here, let's us know before start any test or upgrade the OVS package.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1436610#c3)  Aviv Guetta    2017-04-18 09:59:17 UTC  ``` Hi Flavio, We use the beta you mentioned (openvswitch-2.6.1-10.git20161206.el7fdp), currently I didn't receive any specific comments from consulting. I prefer to leave this bug open for tracking until this feature will be officially inserted to OSP 10.  Aviv   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1436610#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-06 16:59:49 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2553)

## Topic

An update for openvswitch is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

Security Fix(es):

* An unsigned int wrap around leading to a buffer over-read was found when parsing OFPT\_QUEUE\_GET\_CONFIG\_REPLY messages in Open vSwitch (OvS). An attacker could use this flaw to cause a remote DoS. (CVE-2017-9214)
* In Open vSwitch (OvS), while parsing an OpenFlow role status message there is a call to the abort() function for undefined role status reasons in the function `ofp\_print\_role\_status\_message` in `lib/ofp-print.c` that may be leveraged toward a remote DoS attack by a malicious switch. (CVE-2017-9263)
* A buffer over-read flaw was found in Open vSwitch (OvS) while parsing the group mod OpenFlow messages sent from the controller. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). (CVE-2017-9265)

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2571-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                    Thorsten Alteholz

Package        : openvswitch
Version        : 2.6.10-0+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8011 CVE-2017-9214 CVE-2018-17204 CVE-2018-17206
                 CVE-2020-27827 CVE-2020-35498

```
Several issues have been found in openvswitch, a production quality,
multilayer, software-based, Ethernet virtual switch.
```

CVE-2020-35498

    Denial of service attacks, in which crafted network packets
    could cause the packet lookup to ignore network header fields
    from layers 3 and 4. The crafted network packet is an ordinary
    IPv4 or IPv6 packet with Ethernet padding length above 255 bytes.
    This causes the packet sanity check to abort parsing header
    fields after layer 2.

CVE-2020-27827

    Denial of service attacks using crafted LLDP packets.

CVE-2018-17206

    Buffer over-read issue during BUNDLE action decoding.

CVE-2018-17204

    Assertion failure due to not validating information (group type
    and command) in OF1.5 decoder.

CVE-2017-9214

    Buffer over-read that is caused by an unsigned integer underflow.

CVE-2015-8011

    Buffer overflow in the lldp_decode function in
    daemon/protocols/lldp.c in lldpd before 0.8.0 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and
    possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving large
    management addresses and TLV boundaries.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.6.10-0+deb9u1. This version is a new upstream point release.

We recommend that you upgrade your openvswitch packages.

For the detailed security status of openvswitch please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openvswitch>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1431499#c0)  Summer Long    2017-03-13 02:12:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The directory /var/log/openvswitch is world readable and contains log files that are readable, which can result in the exposure of sensitive information. The 'other readable/execute' bits need to be removed from the /var/log/openvswitch directory.  Because no sensitive data was found in the files, this is being raised as a hardening bug, and not a flaw.

# RHSA-2017:2648 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openvswitch security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2648)

## Topic

An update for openvswitch is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

Security Fix(es):

* An unsigned int wrap around leading to a buffer over-read was found when parsing OFPT\_QUEUE\_GET\_CONFIG\_REPLY messages in Open vSwitch (OvS). An attacker could use this flaw to cause a remote DoS. (CVE-2017-9214)
* In Open vSwitch (OvS), while parsing an OpenFlow role status message there is a call to the abort() function for undefined role status reasons in the function `ofp\_print\_role\_status\_message` in `lib/ofp-print.c` that may be leveraged toward a remote DoS attack by a malicious switch. (CVE-2017-9263)
* A buffer over-read was found in the Open vSwitch (OvS) firewall implementation. This flaw can be triggered by parsing a specially crafted TCP, UDP, or IPv6 packet. A remote attack could use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). (CVE-2017-9264)
* A buffer over-read flaw was found in Open vSwitch (OvS) while parsing the group mod OpenFlow messages sent from the controller. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). (CVE-2017-9265)

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2692)

## Topic

An update for openvswitch is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

Security Fix(es):

* An unsigned integer wrap around that led to a buffer over-read was found when parsing OFPT\_QUEUE\_GET\_CONFIG\_REPLY messages in Open vSwitch (OvS). An attacker could use this issue to cause a remote denial of service attack. (CVE-2017-9214)
* While parsing an OpenFlow role status message Open vSwitch (OvS), a call to the abort() function for undefined role status reasons in the function 'ofp\_print\_role\_status\_message' in 'lib/ofp-print.c' could be misused for a remote denial of service attack by a malicious switch. (CVE-2017-9263)
* A buffer over-read issue was found in Open vSwitch (OvS) which emerged while parsing the GroupMod OpenFlow messages sent from the controller. The issue could enable an attacker to cause a denial of service type of attack. (CVE-2017-9265)

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2727)

## Topic

An update for openvswitch is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

Security Fix(es):

* An unsigned integer wrap around that led to a buffer over-read was found when parsing OFPT\_QUEUE\_GET\_CONFIG\_REPLY messages in Open vSwitch (OvS). An attacker could use this issue to cause a remote denial of service attack. (CVE-2017-9214)
* While parsing an OpenFlow role status message Open vSwitch (OvS), a call to the abort() function for undefined role status reasons in the function 'ofp\_print\_role\_status\_message' in 'lib/ofp-print.c' could be misused for a remote denial of service attack by a malicious switch. (CVE-2017-9263)
* A buffer over-read was found in the Open vSwitch (OvS) firewall implementation. This flaw can be triggered by parsing a specially crafted TCP, UDP, or IPv6 packet. A remote attack could use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). (CVE-2017-9264)
* A buffer over-read issue was found in Open vSwitch (OvS) which emerged while parsing the GroupMod OpenFlow messages sent from the controller. The issue could enable an attacker to cause a denial of service type of attack. (CVE-2017-9265)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1431495#c0)  Summer Long    2017-03-13 01:55:41 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The directory /var/log/openvswitch is world readable and contains log files that are readable, which can result in the exposure of sensitive information. The 'other readable/execute' bits need to be removed from the /var/log/openvswitch directory.  Because no sensitive data was found in the files, this is being raised as a hardening bug, and not a flaw.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openvswitch-2.5.0-14.git20160727.el7fdb  Steps to reproduce: $ ls -la /var/log/openvswitch total 40 drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root    52 Mar  6 21:43 . drwxr-xr-x. 27 root root  4096 Mar 12 21:52 .. -rw-r--r--.  1 root root  1667 Mar 12 21:52 ovsdb-server.log -rw-r--r--.  1 root root 26482 Mar 12 21:54 ovs-vswitchd.log   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1431495#c4)  Lon Hohberger    2017-09-05 13:55:11 UTC  ``` [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1431497#c3](show_bug.cgi?id=1431497#c3 "CLOSED ERRATA - openvswitch: /var/log/openvswitch is world readable")   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1431495#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-12 17:12:29 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1431497#c0)  Summer Long    2017-03-13 02:08:19 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The directory /var/log/openvswitch is world readable and contains log files that are readable, which can result in the exposure of sensitive information. The 'other readable/execute' bits need to be removed from the /var/log/openvswitch directory.  Because no sensitive data was found in the files, this is being raised as a hardening bug, and not a flaw.

## Topic

An update for openvswitch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

Security Fix(es):

* An unsigned integer wrap around that led to a buffer over-read was found when parsing OFPT\_QUEUE\_GET\_CONFIG\_REPLY messages in Open vSwitch (OvS). An attacker could use this issue to cause a remote denial of service attack. (CVE-2017-9214)
* While parsing an OpenFlow role status message Open vSwitch (OvS), a call to the abort() function for undefined role status reasons in the function 'ofp\_print\_role\_status\_message' in 'lib/ofp-print.c' could be misused for a remote denial of service attack by a malicious switch. (CVE-2017-9263)
* A buffer over-read issue was found in Open vSwitch (OvS) which emerged while parsing the GroupMod OpenFlow messages sent from the controller. The issue could enable an attacker to cause a denial of service type of attack. (CVE-2017-9265)
