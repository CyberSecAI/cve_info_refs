    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an invalid pointer dereference in the `left_adjust_char_head()` function of the Oniguruma regular expression library. This occurs due to incorrect handling of `reg->dmax` in the `forward_search_range()` function during regular expression compilation.",

        "Invalid pointer dereference",
        "Incorrect handling of `reg->dmax` during regular expression compilation"

        "Crafting a specific regular expression pattern that triggers the vulnerability during compilation.",
        "Providing a specially crafted input string to a vulnerable application that uses the Oniguruma library for regex matching."

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable application with a specially crafted regular expression that triggers the vulnerability when compiled by the Oniguruma library. The attacker may also need to provide input to trigger a regular expression match. No special privileges are mentioned."
