Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-9936:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists within the `tif_jbig.c` file of the libtiff library. This occurs specifically in the error code path of the `JBIGDecode()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. Memory is allocated but not freed under specific error conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Repeated triggering of the memory leak can lead to a significant consumption of system memory, potentially crashing the application or the system due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A specially crafted TIFF image file can trigger the memory leak when processed.
- The vulnerable code is invoked when using tools like `tiff2ps` or `tiff2pdf` to process the malicious TIFF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TIFF image to a user or system that uses the vulnerable libtiff library (or tools using it).
- No special privileges are required for exploitation beyond the ability to provide an input file to the affected tools.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by team OWL337 using a custom fuzzer called AFL.
- The vulnerability affects libtiff versions up to and including 4.0.8.
- The fix involves correcting the memory management in the error handling path of `JBIGDecode()` within `tif_jbig.c`.
- The provided ASAN debug information shows both direct and indirect memory leaks when processing a crafted input file.
