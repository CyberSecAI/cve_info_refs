Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **invalid write of size 8** within the `storeSSE` function, located in `ImfOptimizedPixelReading.h`. This occurs when processing malformed EXR image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write due to incorrect pointer arithmetic within the `storeSSE` function.
*  The test program `exr2aces` has a bug that results in bad pointer math, this is not directly a bug in the `openexr` library itself

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to application crashes.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  There is a possibility for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system, although this is not guaranteed by all sources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network if an attacker can trick a user into opening a malicious EXR file via a network resource.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must open or process a specially crafted EXR image file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted EXR File:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify an EXR file with specific malformations that trigger the invalid write.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker must entice a user to open or process this crafted EXR file using vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** OpenEXR version 2.2.0 is specifically mentioned as vulnerable.
*   **File**: The vulnerability occurs in `ImfOptimizedPixelReading.h`
*   **Fix:** The issue is addressed in OpenEXR version 2.2.1
