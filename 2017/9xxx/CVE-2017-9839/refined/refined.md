Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerabilities in Dolibarr:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- The filter implemented by Dolibarr to prevent SQL injection can be bypassed by URL encoding SQL payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in Dolibarr version 5.0.3 and prior.
- Specific vulnerable parameters include `viewstatut` in the listing of commercial proposals, `type` in `/htdocs/product/stats/card.php`, and `propal_statut` (later renamed to `search_statut`) in `/htdocs/comm/propal/list.php`.
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through both GET and POST parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application.
- This can lead to data breaches, allowing the attacker to:
    - Dump the entire database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain further access to the server.
- The provided content demonstrates the successful use of SQL injection to trigger `SLEEP` commands, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary queries on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- Remote authenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability via HTTP requests to vulnerable Dolibarr pages and parameters.
- The attacker can use SQL injection payloads within GET and POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Dolibarr application.
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Dolibarr instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with malicious SQL payloads in the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker can potentially automate the exploitation using tools like SQLmap and the "charencode" tamper script.

**Additional Details:**
- The `viewstatut` parameter remained vulnerable even in version 7.0.0 after some of the SQLi vulns were fixed in v5.0.4.
- The `propal_statut` parameter was renamed to `search_statut` in version 7.0.0, but remains vulnerable.
- The provided example uses SQL commands like `SLEEP()` to demonstrate successful injection by observing response time differences.
