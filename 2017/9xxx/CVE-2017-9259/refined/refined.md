Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described that corresponds to CVE-2017-9259:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `TDStretch::acceptNewOverlapLength` function within the `source/SoundTouch/TDStretch.cpp` file of SoundTouch 1.9.2.
*   **Weakness:** The function is susceptible to a memory allocation error. When processing a crafted WAV file, it attempts to allocate an extremely large chunk of memory (5922611200 bytes), which leads to a failure and crash due to memory exhaustion. This is related to how the overlap length is calculated and accepted during audio processing.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The application crashes due to the memory allocation failure, rendering it unusable.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves providing a specifically crafted WAV audio file as input to the `soundstretch` utility.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted WAV file to be processed by SoundTouch. The user would need to process the malicious file.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `acceptNewOverlapLength` function is called as part of the audio processing. This function attempts to allocate an extremely large buffer.
*   The error message from AddressSanitizer highlights the failure to allocate the memory using `LargeMmapAllocator`.
*   The stack trace shows the call chain leading to the memory allocation error, starting with `soundtouch::TDStretch::acceptNewOverlapLength`.
*   The Proof of Concept (POC) file `SoundTouch_1.9.2_memory_allocation_error.wav` demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
