- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability occurs due to how login attempts are processed with a locked account in CA Identity Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for an exhaustive search to potentially learn the password of a locked-out account. This suggests a flaw in the account lockout mechanism or password validation process that allows an attacker to test passwords even after an account is locked.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can potentially gain sensitive information by learning the password of a locked-out account. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system and data, and further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the CA Identity Manager system. They don't need prior access or privileged credentials to attempt the attack on locked accounts.
