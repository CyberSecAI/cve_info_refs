{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `readelf` utility in binutils attempts to allocate memory for program headers without checking if the number of program headers is excessive, leading to an allocation failure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Unbounded memory allocation leading to a memory allocation failure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service by causing the `readelf` utility to fail due to memory allocation failure.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted ELF file with an excessive number of program headers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to parse a crafted ELF file using the vulnerable `readelf` utility."
