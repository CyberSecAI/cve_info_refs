The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in BigTree-CMS version 4.2.18.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `description` parameter when saving page revisions. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `description` field, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of input sanitization when saving page revisions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with low-privileged access (e.g., an administrator user) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page revision description. When a high-privileged user (e.g., a developer) views the affected page revisions, the injected JavaScript code is executed in their browser.
- This can allow the attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of the high-privileged user, including modifying user profiles when combined with a CSRF vulnerability (as noted in the report).
- This can lead to complete compromise of the CMS, because it allows for privilege escalation through a lower privileged user to execute actions as a higher privileged user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker logs in with an administrator account and modifies the `description` parameter when saving page revisions through the admin interface with a crafted payload. This payload will be stored on the server.
- A high-privileged user will trigger the stored payload by simply viewing the revisions within the admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a low-privileged account with administrative rights within the BigTree-CMS application.
- They need to be able to craft a payload that is suitable for an XSS attack.
- They need knowledge of where to inject and trigger the XSS attack.
