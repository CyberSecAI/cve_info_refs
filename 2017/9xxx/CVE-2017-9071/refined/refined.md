The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9071.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to properly validate the Host header. This allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the application's cache.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cache poisoning via the Host header.
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application's response, leading to XSS.
- This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a malicious Host header in the HTTP request.
- The application caches the response, including the malicious Host header.
- Subsequent users who access the cached page will execute the malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific position is needed, as this is a client-side vulnerability.
