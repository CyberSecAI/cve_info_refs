- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ReadMPCImage` function in `mpc.c` has a memory leak vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak. The `ReadMPCImage` function allocates memory but does not free it in certain code paths when processing a crafted MPC file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. Repeatedly processing a crafted MPC file leads to memory exhaustion, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted MPC file to be processed by ImageMagick.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted MPC file to the vulnerable ImageMagick application.
