    "vulnerability": "The root cause of the crash in four cases is a bug in the test program (exr2aces) -- not in the OpenEXR library itself.  For example, the suggested description for [CVE-2017-9111](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qxh9-r8xw-7v99 \"CVE-2017-9111\") says:\nIn OpenEXR 2.2.0,\nan invalid write of size 8 in the storeSSE function in\nImfOptimizedPixelReading.h could cause the application to crash or\nexecute arbitrary code.\nBut that's not actually correct, the bug appears to be this (exr2aces/main.cpp):\nThe lines above that calculate the width and height of the framebuffer to create do so using the dataWindow property. If we use exrheader to dump that information for the related test file, we see: The lines above that calculate the width and height of the framebuffer to create do so using the dataWindow property. If we use exrheader to dump that information for the related test file, we see:\nSo really, the only bad thing about this file is wildly impractical dimensions implied by the dataWindow. Technically, the maximum dimensions of an OpenEXR image are INT\_32*INT\_32 (box2i), so this is still within the limits from what I can see.\nNow back to the bug, but with the values from exrheader substituted:\nSubstituting the calculated width and height: That leads us to here; again substituting the values:\nIf you look above, it's obvious what's happening -- bad pointer math. As far as I can tell, the library itself doesn't have an issue for this particular test case; this is just bad logic in exr2aces.",
