The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) version 2.7. Here's the breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2017-9256:

**CVE-2017-9256**

*   **Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (DoS) via large loop and CPU consumption.
*   **Root Cause:** The `mp4ff_read_stco` function in `common/mp4ff/mp4atom.c` processes a crafted MP4 file, leading to an excessive loop.
*   **Weakness:** The code reads an entry count from the MP4 file and uses it to control a loop without proper validation, which can be arbitrarily large. Specifically, the `stco_entry_count` value is read from the file and is used directly in the loop condition without any checks.
*   **Impact:** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a denial of service by causing high CPU consumption due to the large loop, potentially rendering the application unresponsive.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted MP4 file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to create and supply a malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable application (FAAD2).
*   **Code Snippet:**
```c
static int32_t mp4ff_read_stco(mp4ff_t *f)
{
    int32_t i;

    mp4ff_read_char(f); /* version */
    mp4ff_read_int24(f); /* flags */
    f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stco_entry_count = mp4ff_read_int32(f); <========

    f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stco_chunk_offset =
        (int32_t*)malloc(f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stco_entry_count*sizeof(int32_t));

    for (i = 0; i < f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stco_entry_count; i++) <========
    {
        f->track[f->total_tracks - 1]->stco_chunk_offset[i] = mp4ff_read_int32(f);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
