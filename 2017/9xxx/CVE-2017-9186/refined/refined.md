```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Signed integer overflow when calculating memory size
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Signed integer overflow
- Impact of exploitation:  Denial of service, possible memory corruption if the result of the overflow is used to allocate memory.
- Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted BMP file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to provide a crafted file to be processed by the application
