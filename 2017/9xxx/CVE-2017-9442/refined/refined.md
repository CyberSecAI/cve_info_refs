Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of uploaded ZIP files within the `unpack.php` files located in `\BigTree-CMS-4.2.18\core\admin\modules\developer\extensions\install\` and `\BigTree-CMS-4.2.18\core\admin\modules\developer\packages\install\`.  Specifically, the code extracts the contents of the uploaded zip file to a cache directory without proper sanitization, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary files, including those with malicious PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows the upload of ZIP archives without validating their content, including the presence of executable files such as PHP scripts.
*   **Insecure Extraction:** The `extract` function of the `PclZip` library is used to extract the contents of the uploaded ZIP archive to a cache directory. No checks are performed during extraction to ensure that the extracted files are benign. Specifically, the vulnerability mentions the attacker's ability to add a php file into the uploaded zip file and have it extracted.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not validate the contents of the zip file or sanitize the file paths before extraction, leaving the system vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads and PHP code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious ZIP archive containing PHP code, which, upon extraction, gets written to the file system. This PHP code can be accessed and executed by the server, allowing the attacker to perform arbitrary operations on the server.  The attacker essentially gains a "webshell," which provides them with a backdoor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the file upload functionality present in the install sections of extensions and packages in the developer modules.
*   **ZIP Archive Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious ZIP archive containing PHP files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the BigTree CMS admin panel:** The attacker must be able to log into the admin panel in order to access and exploit the developer module functionalities, specifically the upload functionalities within the extension and package installers.
*   **Ability to craft malicious ZIP file:**  The attacker needs the technical capability to create a ZIP archive containing files with malicious PHP code.
