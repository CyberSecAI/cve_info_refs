Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2017-9964 and related CVEs:

**CVE-2017-9964**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a Path Traversal vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input related to file paths, allowing an attacker to access files or directories outside of the intended scope.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who can sniff network communications can perform a directory traversal attack, leading to either authentication bypass or session hijacking.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network communication sniffing. The attack is performed by crafting malicious requests that include directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../) to access unintended resources.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept network communications to exploit this vulnerability, and no privileges are initially needed.

**CVE-2017-9965**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a Path Traversal vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** Similar to CVE-2017-9964, the application fails to properly validate file paths provided by users.
*   **Impact:** An unauthorized user can view arbitrary web server files by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability.
*    **Attack Vector:** Network-based, by sending malicious requests using directory traversal sequences.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No specific privileges or user interaction are needed to exploit. It's network-based access.

**CVE-2017-9966**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper Access Control
*   **Weakness:** The system does not properly restrict user privileges, allowing an authorized user to replace critical system files.
*  **Impact:** A user with some privileges can replace files, which can then be executed with elevated privileges allowing for system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** By replacing certain files, usually through the network, but in this case also implies local access is possible.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker with an authorized account/access and the ability to perform file replacement operations. This requires the attacker to have some level of access to the system and to perform specific actions.

**Additional Information:**
