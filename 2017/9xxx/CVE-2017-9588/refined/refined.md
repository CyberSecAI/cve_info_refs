The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9588.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected iOS applications. It is suspected that the problematic code may originate from a third-party library used by these applications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This allows for a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept the banking username and password of users logging into the affected application. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's bank account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be carried out wirelessly by an attacker positioned within a range of approximately 50-100 feet of the victim's device. The attacker intercepts network traffic during the login process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. This is achievable through tools like bettercap, by enabling HTTPS sniffing and using the POST request parser. The attacker does not need to modify the mobile application or require any specific access credentials.
