Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-9036:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the web-based management console of Trend Micro ServerProtect for Linux allowing users to set the quarantine directory to an arbitrary location on the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted Quarantine Directory:** The software allows setting the quarantine directory to any location on the file system.
*   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** An unauthenticated user could exploit other vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS) to change the Quarantine directory settings.
*   **File Handling:** Files flagged as suspicious are moved to the specified quarantine directory without changing their name or permissions (other than setting file permissions to 0600), maintaining ownership by root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** By setting the quarantine directory to a sensitive location (e.g., `/etc/cron.d`), a local attacker can place a malicious file, as root. The file being in the quarantine folder can later be used to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, leading to a complete system compromise.
*   An attacker can overwrite existing files in arbitrary locations of the filesystem with root permissions which can be used in many privilege escalation scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Management Console:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web-based management console interface, specifically through the functionality to set the quarantine directory.
*  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An unauthenticated remote attacker can leverage a CSRF attack on an authenticated user to change the quarantine directory.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An unauthenticated remote attacker can leverage XSS vulnerabilities to change the quarantine directory settings if a privileged user visits the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** To directly leverage the quarantine directory for privilege escalation, the attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Network Access:** To exploit via CSRF or XSS, an attacker needs network access to the web interface. The attacker needs to be able to lure an authenticated user to interact with a malicious page to trigger the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Trend Micro ServerProtect for Linux 3.0-1061 with SP1 Patch 7 (1.0-1505). Other versions may also be affected.
*   The advisory provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to change the quarantine directory and place a malicious cron job.
*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-9035, CVE-2017-9034, CVE-2017-9033, CVE-2017-9037, CVE-2017-9032) found in Trend Micro ServerProtect for Linux.
*   The advisory also documents the timeline of the vulnerability disclosure process, highlighting the communication and coordination between Core Security and Trend Micro.
