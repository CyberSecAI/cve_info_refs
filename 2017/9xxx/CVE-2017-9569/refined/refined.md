The provided content discusses a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS applications, including "CBTX On the Go" which is associated with CVE-2017-9569.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. It's suggested that this code may be derived from a third-party source. The specifics of the TLS certificate validation failure are not described in detail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This means that the applications do not properly verify the authenticity of the server they are communicating with. This can lead to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept the banking username and password of a user logging into the affected application. This can lead to unauthorized access to the user's bank account and potential financial loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim's device during the login process.
- The attacker can silently intercept network traffic when the user is logging into the app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the user.
- The attacker needs to have the capability to intercept network traffic, which can be done using tools like bettercap.
- The attacker needs to be able to parse the POST requests to extract the credentials.
- The attacker does not need to modify the application or perform any other prerequisites other than enabling HTTPS sniffing and using a POST request parser.

**Affected Application:**
- “CBTX On the Go” by Citizens Bank TX, version 3.0.0 (CVE-2017-9569)
