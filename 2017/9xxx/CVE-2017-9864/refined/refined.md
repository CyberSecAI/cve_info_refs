Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper access control within the SMA Solar Technology products. Specifically, it is possible to change the plant time of the inverter without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is that the "change plant time" functionality is accessible without requiring any form of authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Time Manipulation:** An attacker can alter the inverter's system time.
*   **Lockout Policy Issues:** Changing the system time can interfere with lockout policies that rely on time.
*   **Random Generator Problems:**  Time-based random number generators may be affected, which could impact security mechanisms.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Timestamped data for analysis can be rendered unreliable. For example, graphs based on hourly PV power can be manipulated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the SMA inverter. If the inverter is connected to the internet either directly or through NAT, the attack can originate from the internet.
*   **Sunny Explorer:** The attack is performed using the Sunny Explorer application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited even without a valid login.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    1.  Start the Sunny Explorer application.
    2.  Attempt authentication with an incorrect password. The application will still launch but report that you lack access rights to the device.
    3.  Select the "change plant time" function, which is available despite the lack of authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the SMA inverter, or have network access to it (e.g., over the internet if the device is exposed).
*   **Sunny Explorer:** The attacker needs to use the Sunny Explorer application or equivalent to interact with the SMA device.
*   **No Authentication:** No valid credentials are required, this can be done with a false login attempt.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The information provided is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
*   The document mentions that the vendor has confirmed the vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is related to the "Horus Scenario," a concept that highlights potential attacks on power grids by exploiting vulnerabilities in solar inverters.
