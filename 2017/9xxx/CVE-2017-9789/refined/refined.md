    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the server and trigger stress conditions such as closing many connections.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by closing many connections, suggesting a stress condition is required for exploitation.
