## Description

[![@xfkxfk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17606708?u=b47d12de6851a63d1cb66519a7524f6bb3447276&v=4&size=48)](/xfkxfk)[xfkxfk](https://github.com/xfkxfk)opened [on May 17, 2017](https://github.com/bigtreecms/BigTree-CMS/issues/282#issue-229243311)

There is two design flaw in BigTree CMS Less than 4.2.18

one.

the administrator-level user can delete or edit another administrator-level user, resulting in malicious delete or edit.

the current user can only delete or edit users who have less privileges than him.

two.

the current user can delete himself Bypass system restrictions（The system is disabled by default）.

the current user may net delete himself.

the Flawed code:

admin\ajax\users\delete.php

```
$admin->requireLevel(1);
$admin->deleteUser($id);

```

\core\inc\bigtree\admin.php

```
function requireLevel($level) {
			global $admin,$bigtree,$cms;
			if (!isset($this->Level) || $this->Level < $level) {
				define("BIGTREE_ACCESS_DENIED",true);
				$this->stop(file_get_contents(BigTree::path("admin/pages/_denied.php")));
			}
		}

function deleteUser($id) {
			$id = sqlescape($id);
			// If this person has higher access levels than the person trying to update them, fail.
			$current = static::getUser($id);
			if ($current["level"] > $this->Level) {
				return false;
			}

			sqlquery("DELETE FROM bigtree_users WHERE id = '$id'");
			$this->track("bigtree_users",$id,"deleted");

			return true;
		}
