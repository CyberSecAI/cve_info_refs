The provided content describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the `cmd_info()` function of radare2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability occurs due to a use-after-free condition in the `cmd_info()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability. The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption and undefined behavior.
- It can potentially be exploited to gain control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input to the `r2` command-line tool.
- Specifically, loading a specially crafted file using `r2 -A r2_uaf_cmd_info`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `r2` tool with a crafted input file.
- No special privileges are explicitly mentioned; a user with access to execute the tool can trigger the vulnerability.
