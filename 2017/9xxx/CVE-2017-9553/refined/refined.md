Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9553:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A design flaw in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) allowed a bypass of the encryption protection mechanism during the authentication phase.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure fallback mechanism: If the initial request for PKI-based encryption fails (by modifying the 'version' parameter in the API call to `/webapi/encryption.cgi`), the client-side code falls back to sending credentials unencrypted (plaintext).
- Lack of user notification: This fallback happens silently, without informing the user that their credentials will be sent unencrypted.
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) vulnerability: The vulnerability allows MitM attackers to intercept the unencrypted credentials, effectively stealing the user's username and password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- User account and password theft.
- Potential unauthorized access to the NAS device and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack: An attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the Synology NAS device.
- Modification of API request: The attacker modifies the initial API call to `/webapi/encryption.cgi` by changing the ‘version’ parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the Synology NAS device. This could be on the same local network or through a compromised network device.
- Ability to modify HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP request made by the client to the NAS device's API.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in the client-side code, which performs the encryption.
- The server responds with an error upon receiving the modified request, triggering the client-side fallback to plaintext transmission.
- The vulnerability was discovered by 2-sec's expert team during a penetration test.
- Synology released a patch in DSM version 6.1.3-15152 to address the issue.
