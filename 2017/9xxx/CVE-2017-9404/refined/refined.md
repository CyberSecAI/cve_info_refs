Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9404:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in the `OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesQTable` function within the `tif_ojpeg.c` file of the libtiff library. This happens when processing a crafted TIFF file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: The vulnerability is a memory leak, specifically within the `OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesQTable` function. This function allocates memory but fails to free it under certain conditions triggered by a maliciously crafted TIFF file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The memory leak can cause a denial of service by consuming system resources. This can happen when the application processes numerous crafted TIFF files, leading to exhaustion of memory and potentially causing crashes or instability.
- Possible Arbitrary Code Execution (Ubuntu Security Notice): Although not explicitly stated in the bug report, the Ubuntu security notice suggests that exploitation of this vulnerability could, in some cases, lead to arbitrary code execution with user privileges, although the primary impact appears to be denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted TIFF File: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF file.
- Remote Attack: The vulnerability can be triggered remotely if an application processes a crafted TIFF image received from an untrusted source. The attack vector also includes situations where an automated system opens a crafted image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or modify a TIFF file: The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed TIFF image that will trigger the memory leak in the `OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesQTable` function.
- Ability to deliver a malicious TIFF file: The attacker needs to deliver this crafted TIFF file to a target system to trigger the vulnerable code path in libtiff. This could happen through email attachments, downloads from malicious sites or by other means.
