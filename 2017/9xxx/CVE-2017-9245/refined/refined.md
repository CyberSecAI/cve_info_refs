The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9245.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Google News and Weather application for Android did not use SSL for some server calls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure communication: The application sent authentication tokens (OAuth) over unencrypted HTTP connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive data: An attacker monitoring the network could capture the authentication tokens.
- Unauthorized access: Captured tokens could be used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or service accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network monitoring: An attacker could monitor network traffic between the application and Google's servers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker needs to be positioned to monitor the network traffic.
- Passive sniffing: The attacker can passively capture the traffic, no interaction is required with the vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in version 3.1.4 of the app.
- Google fixed the vulnerability in version 3.3.1.
- The affected traffic was generated when clicking on news articles from sites that don't use SSL.
- The specific tokens exposed are not identified as user account tokens or service account tokens.
