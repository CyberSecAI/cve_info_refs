# Advisory: Google’s Android News and Weather App Doesn’t Always Use SSL [CVE-2017-9245]

[July 18, 2017](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2017/07/18/advisory-googles-android-news-and-weather-app-doesnt-always-use-ssl-cve-2017-9245/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [google](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/google/)

# Summary

**Google News and Weather Application for Android** does not use SSL for some server calls, exposing authentication tokens (OAuth) to anyone monitoring the network. It is not clear if the tokens belong to the user’s account or a service account. The vendor (Google) fixed the issue in **v3.3.1** of the application and users should install the latest version. MITRE has assigned **CVE-2017-9245** to track this issue.

# Details

The Google News and Weather application for Android is an application developed by Google which aggregates news from multiple sources. This application was originally included as part of the stock Android operating system but was separated into its own application around August 2014.

While performing network level testing of various Google applications, we discovered that some of the calls made by the application to Google’s server did not use SSL. Furthermore, analysis of the captured traffic showed that an authentication token (OAuth) was sent as part of those calls, thus exposing it to an attacker that is monitoring the network. It is not clear from our testing whether this token belonged to the user using the application, or was some sort of a service account.

We also did not test earlier versions of the application, so it is also unclear whether this issue affects older versions of Android where this is part of the stock operating system.

To replicate the issue on v3.1.4:

1. Install the application and open it.
2. Flick away the application.
3. Setup the proxy without an SSL certificate and point the Android device to it.
4. Go back to the application and select any news feed, and then click on a news article from a site that doesn’t use SSL.
5. Go back to the proxy and observe captured traffic.

All testing was done on Android 7 and application v3.1.4. Network captures were performed using an on-device proxy (PacketCapture) without a trusted SSL certificate.

Screenshots below – note that sensitive data has been blanked out:

# Vendor Response

This issue was responsibly reported to the vendor and fixed in version 3.3.1 which was released in late June 2017. It is not clear if older versions of Android that include this as part of the OS are affected and/or fixable.

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Advisory: Google’s Android News and Weather App Doesn’t Always Use SSL [CVE-2017-9245]

[July 18, 2017](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2017/07/18/advisory-googles-android-news-and-weather-app-doesnt-always-use-ssl-cve-2017-9245/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [google](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/google/)

# Summary

**Google News and Weather Application for Android** does not use SSL for some server calls, exposing authentication tokens (OAuth) to anyone monitoring the network. It is not clear if the tokens belong to the user’s account or a service account. The vendor (Google) fixed the issue in **v3.3.1** of the application and users should install the latest version. MITRE has assigned **CVE-2017-9245** to track this issue.

# Details

The Google News and Weather application for Android is an application developed by Google which aggregates news from multiple sources. This application was originally included as part of the stock Android operating system but was separated into its own application around August 2014.

While performing network level testing of various Google applications, we discovered that some of the calls made by the application to Google’s server did not use SSL. Furthermore, analysis of the captured traffic showed that an authentication token (OAuth) was sent as part of those calls, thus exposing it to an attacker that is monitoring the network. It is not clear from our testing whether this token belonged to the user using the application, or was some sort of a service account.

We also did not test earlier versions of the application, so it is also unclear whether this issue affects older versions of Android where this is part of the stock operating system.

To replicate the issue on v3.1.4:

1. Install the application and open it.
2. Flick away the application.
3. Setup the proxy without an SSL certificate and point the Android device to it.
4. Go back to the application and select any news feed, and then click on a news article from a site that doesn’t use SSL.
5. Go back to the proxy and observe captured traffic.

All testing was done on Android 7 and application v3.1.4. Network captures were performed using an on-device proxy (PacketCapture) without a trusted SSL certificate.

# Vendor Response

This issue was responsibly reported to the vendor and fixed in version 3.3.1 which was released in late June 2017. It is not clear if older versions of Android that include this as part of the OS are affected and/or fixable.

# Google’s Android News and Weather App Doesn’t Always Use SSL [CVE-2017-9245]

---

*From*: Nightwatch Cybersecurity Research <research () nightwatchcybersecurity com>

[Blog post here:
<https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2017/07/18/advisory-googles-android-news-and-weather-app-doesnt-always-use-ssl-cve-2017-9245/>]

SUMMARY

Google News and Weather Application for Android does not use SSL for
some server calls, exposing authentication tokens (OAuth) to anyone
monitoring the network. It is not clear if the tokens belong to the
user’s account or a service account. The vendor (Google) fixed the
issue in v3.3.1 of the application and users should install the latest
version. MITRE has assigned CVE-2017-9245 to track this issue.

DETAILS

The Google News and Weather application for Android is an application
developed by Google which aggregates news from multiple sources. This
application was originally included as part of the stock Android
operating system but was separated into its own application around
August 2014.

While performing network level testing of various Google applications,
we discovered that some of the calls made by the application to
Google’s server did not use SSL. Furthermore, analysis of the captured
traffic showed that an authentication token (OAuth) was sent as part
of those calls, thus exposing it to an attacker that is monitoring the
network. It is not clear from our testing whether this token belonged
to the user using the application, or was some sort of a service
account.

We also did not test earlier versions of the application, so it is
also unclear whether this issue affects older versions of Android
where this is part of the stock operating system.

To replicate the issue on v3.1.4:

1. Install the application and open it.
2. Flick away the application.
3. Setup the proxy without an SSL certificate and point the Android
device to it.
4. Go back to the application and select any news feed, and then click
on a news article from a site that doesn’t use SSL.
5. Go back to the proxy and observe captured traffic.

All testing was done on Android 7 and application v3.1.4. Network
captures were performed using an on-device proxy (PacketCapture)
without a trusted SSL certificate.

VENDOR RESPONSE

This issue was responsibly reported to the vendor and fixed in version
3.3.1 which was released in late June 2017. It is not clear if older
versions of Android that include this as part of the OS are affected
and/or fixable.
