- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
  - Stack overflow: The `sprintf` function is used to copy a user-controlled string into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
  - Heap overflow: The `strcpy` function copies a user-controlled string into a fixed-size heap buffer without any size limit.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Stack-based buffer overflow due to usage of `sprintf`.
  - Heap-based buffer overflow due to usage of `strcpy`.
  - Lack of input validation/sanitization on user-supplied parameters.
  - Insecure usage of format string.
  - The device uses partial ASLR, but the heap is predictable, allowing for reliable exploitation.
  - Stack and heap memory regions are writable and executable, which simplifies exploitation.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
  -  Remote code execution with root privileges on the device by overwriting return address on the stack or function pointers on the heap.
  -  The attacker can inject arbitrary code, potentially leading to full device compromise.
  - The device becomes a platform for further attacks, such as network sniffing, DNS poisoning, and injection of malicious content.

- **Attack vectors:**
  - Stack overflow: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a long `fname` parameter. The vulnerability can be exploited from an external network via a cross site request forgery (XSRF) attack.
  - Heap overflow: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with an overly long string in the `Cookie` header. The attacker must have network connectivity to the device to exploit this vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - Stack overflow: The attacker needs to craft a specific HTTP request with an overly long `fname` parameter, and can trigger the attack via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attack.
   - Heap overflow: The attacker must have network connectivity to the device and be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted `Cookie` header. The attacker can be on the same network as the device, or potentially have access to the network where the device is connected (e.g. via a compromised router).
