Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization of the `reportId` parameter within the `getReportStatus` action method of the Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server's Web Management Console. This allows for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly restrict the `reportId` parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate it to access files outside of the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leak:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of the `kluser` account, potentially exposing sensitive data such as configuration files, user information, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to the `/cgi-bin/cgictl` endpoint.
- **Manipulated `reportId` Parameter:** The attacker includes a path traversal sequence (e.g., `..%2f..%2f..%2f...`) in the `reportId` parameter to navigate to the desired file location. A null byte `%00` is appended to terminate the path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web management console, typically over the network.
- **No authentication is needed:** The attacker does not require prior authentication for this specific exploit.

**Technical Details:**

- The proof-of-concept demonstrates reading the `/etc/passwd` file using the following crafted URL:
  ```
  /cgi-bin/cgictl?action=getReportStatus&reportId=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd%00
  ```
