Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-9859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The SMA inverters use a weak hashing algorithm to encrypt the password for REGISTER requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Weak hashing algorithm is used to encrypt passwords for SIP REGISTER requests.
- The weak algorithm allows for relatively easy cracking of the password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The plaintext password used for REGISTER requests can be recovered.
- An attacker can register at the SMA servers using the cracked password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to sniff REGISTER requests and extract the hashed password.
- Offline cracking of the hashed password using readily available tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to intercept the REGISTER requests.
- No specific user privileges are required, meaning an unauthenticated attacker can perform this.
