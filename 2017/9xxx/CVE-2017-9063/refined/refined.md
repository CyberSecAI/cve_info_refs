Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9063:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content indicates that CVE-2017-9063 is related to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability discovered in the WordPress Customizer.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unspecified vulnerability within the WordPress Customizer, which allowed for a cross-site scripting attack. The specific code flaw is not detailed in the provided text but is related to how the customizer handles data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS): This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser.
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Theft of sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the WordPress Customizer.
- An attacker would need to inject malicious script through the Customizer interface

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to manipulate the Customizer interface in a way that injects malicious JavaScript.
- The attacker would then need to induce a user to access the affected pages, or get an administrator to trigger the vulnerability within the customizer.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in WordPress version 4.7.5.
- The fix involved changes to `wp-admin/customize.php`, `wp-admin/js/customize-controls.js`, `wp-admin/js/customize-controls.min.js` and `wp-includes/class-wp-customize-manager.php` files. These changes likely implement sanitization/validation of user input or improved output escaping.

The information provided is consistent with a typical XSS vulnerability and gives some additional insight into the location of the vulnerability.
