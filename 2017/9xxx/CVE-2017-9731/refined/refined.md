- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Source` field in the generated `.ipk` package control file included the full `SRC_URI`, which could potentially leak sensitive information like credentials embedded in URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure vulnerability due to inclusion of sensitive information in the package metadata.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information, such as credentials or internal network locations, if they had access to the generated .ipk package files.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need access to the generated `.ipk` package files, which could be obtained through various means, like compromising a build server or a package repository.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the generated `.ipk` package files is required.
