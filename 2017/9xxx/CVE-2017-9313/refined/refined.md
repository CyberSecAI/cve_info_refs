Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-9313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in several Webmin modules, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Specifically, user-supplied input in the `page`, `sec`, and `referers` parameters as well as the `name` parameter, is not properly escaped before being displayed back to the user in the web interface, resulting in XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in multiple modules.
  - `man/view_man.cgi`: Vulnerable via `page` and `sec` parameters
  - `webmin/change_referers.cgi`: Vulnerable via the `referers` parameter.
  - `acl/save_user.cgi`: Vulnerable via the `name` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Webmin interface.
- When a victim (Webmin user) accesses a specially crafted link, the injected script is executed in their browser within the context of the Webmin session.
- This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking, where the attacker can take over the victim's Webmin session
  - Defacement of the Webmin interface.
  - Execution of arbitrary administrative actions within the Webmin context.
  - Stealing of sensitive information displayed or processed through Webmin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker crafts malicious URLs containing XSS payloads in the vulnerable parameters
- The victim is lured to click on the malicious link (e.g., through phishing or other social engineering).
- The Webmin server reflects the malicious script in the response, causing the victim's browser to execute the script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs.
- The attacker needs to trick a legitimate Webmin user into accessing the malicious URL while logged into Webmin.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes the fix for this vulnerability, which involves HTML escaping the vulnerable parameters before outputting them to the page, preventing the execution of malicious Javascript code. The changes are implemented in commits `a330e91` and `c2d4a90`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Webmin version 1.850.
