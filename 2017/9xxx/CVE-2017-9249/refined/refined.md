{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The /readfile.php script does not properly sanitize the filename parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code when a user accesses a crafted URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the filename parameter passed to readfile.php.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a malicious HTML file (poc.html) to the server and crafts a URL that points to that file, which is then passed to the vulnerable /readfile.php script. This crafted URL is then used to execute the XSS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to upload a file to the server. The attacker needs to craft a URL with a specific format, including the file name and parameters."
