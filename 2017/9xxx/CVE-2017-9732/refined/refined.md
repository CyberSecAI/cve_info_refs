{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `read_packet()` function in `gssstdio.c` within Kerberized NetCat (KNC) contains a memory leak. A temporary buffer allocated within this function is not freed under certain conditions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak vulnerability in the read_packet function when processing GSS-API authentication.",
        "Insufficient error handling leading to unreleased memory allocation."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting the server's memory, potentially affecting other services on the same host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker sends specially crafted Kerberos handshake structures with an unexpected type (e.g., 0x0000 instead of AP_REQ 0x0100 at bytes 16 and 17) within the initial GSS-API handshake.",
        "Sending a sequence of such malformed packets can exhaust server memory"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any authentication and only needs network connectivity to the vulnerable service.",
    "additional_details": "The memory leak occurs because `gss_accept_sec_context` returns `G_CONTINUE_NEEDED`, causing the `read_packet()` function to allocate memory without freeing it in a loop. The vulnerability is triggered during the GSS-API authentication process."
