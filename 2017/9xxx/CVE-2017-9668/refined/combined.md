# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[![@XiaoZhis](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29492108?u=6824c4eaa38324fa0756d3c700a49e851190f4f5&v=4&size=48)](/XiaoZhis)[XiaoZhis](https://github.com/XiaoZhis)opened [on Jun 17, 2017](https://github.com/XiaoZhis/ProjectSend/issues/2#issue-236649734)

USE [CVE-2017-9668](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hmjc-g9f9-q7gj "CVE-2017-9668")

when adding a user group, there is no XSS filtering, resulting in storage-type XSS generation, via the description parameter in an addgroup action.

code:

$CMS\_ADMIN\_PAGE=1;

require\_once("../lib/include.php");

require\_once("../lib/classes/class.group.inc.php");

$urlext='?'.CMS\_SECURE\_PARAM\_NAME.'='.$\_SESSION[CMS\_USER\_KEY];

check\_login();

$error = "";

$group= "";

if (isset($\_POST["group"])) $group = $\_POST["group"];

$description= "";

if (isset($\_POST["description"])) **$description = $\_POST["description"];**

$active = 1;

if (!isset($\_POST["active"]) && isset($\_POST["addgroup"])) $active = 0;

if (isset($\_POST["cancel"])) {

redirect("listgroups.php".$urlext);

return;

}

$userid = get\_userid();

$access = check\_permission($userid, 'Manage Groups');

if ($access) {

if (isset($\_POST["addgroup"])) {

try {

if ($group == '') throw new \CmsInvalidDataException(lang('nofieldgiven', lang('groupname')));

```
        $groupobj = new Group();
        $groupobj->name = $group;
        $groupobj->description = $description;
        $groupobj->active = $active;

        Events::SendEvent('Core', 'AddGroupPre', array('group' => &$groupobj));

        $result = $groupobj->save();
        if( !$result ) throw new \RuntimeException(lang('errorinsertinggroup'));

        Events::SendEvent('Core', 'AddGroupPost', array('group' => &$groupobj));
        // put mention into the admin log
        audit($groupobj->id, 'Admin User Group: '.$groupobj->name, 'Added');
        redirect("listgroups.php".$urlext);
        return;
    }
    catch( \Exception $e ) {
        $error .= '<li>'.$e->GetMessage().'</li>';
    }
}

```
