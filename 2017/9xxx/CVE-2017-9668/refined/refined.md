Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9668:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because there is no XSS filtering on the `description` parameter when adding a user group in the `admin\addgroup.php` file of CMS Made Simple version 2.1.6.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `description` field when creating a user group. This code is then stored in the system and executed when a user views the group details.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser. This could lead to various attacks, including:
    -  Session hijacking
    -  Defacement of the website
    -  Phishing attacks
    -  Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker needs to access the CMS Made Simple admin panel.
- The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to `admin/addgroup.php` containing the malicious payload in the `description` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the "Manage Groups" permission in CMS Made Simple. This implies the attacker needs to have administrative access.
- No user interaction is required after the malicious group is created. The XSS payload is executed when the administrator views the group information.
