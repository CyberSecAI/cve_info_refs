The provided content relates to multiple CVEs, including CVE-2017-9167.

**CVE-2017-9167**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-buffer-overflow in the `ReadImage` function of `input-bmp.c`, specifically within the BMP file parsing logic.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability is present in `input-bmp.c:337:25`. The `ReadImage` function attempts to write outside of the allocated buffer.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted BMP file to the `autotrace` tool, an attacker can trigger the heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious BMP file as input to the autotrace utility.
