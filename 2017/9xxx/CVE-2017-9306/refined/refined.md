The provided content describes two separate XSS vulnerabilities, one in Tiki-Wiki and another in sysPass. Only the Tiki-Wiki vulnerability is relevant to CVE-2017-9306 as per the CVE description, which describes an XSS vulnerability in Tiki Wiki. The sysPass portion is thus omitted from this analysis.

**Vulnerability Details (Tiki-Wiki):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an insufficient sanitization process within Tiki-Wiki's `RemoveXSSchars()` function, specifically how it handles HTML encoded characters.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The `RemoveXSSchars()` function attempts to decode HTML-encoded strings recursively and then uses `RemoveXSSregexp()` to match against a blacklist.
    *   The regular expression in `RemoveXSSchars()` can be bypassed by padding hex encoded characters with more than 8 leading zeros.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, enabling an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerable code is in `TikiFilter_PreventXss` class, which filters the `$_GET['editionId']` input of `tiki-batch_send_newsletter.php`.
    *   An attacker can inject crafted HTML-encoded payloads into the `editionId` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP GET requests and manipulate the `editionId` parameter. The "Newsletters" feature must also be enabled within the target Tiki-Wiki instance.
    *   No specific authentication requirements are mentioned in this content.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `RemoveXSSchars()` function uses regular expressions to decode HTML entities, but the regex pattern `&#x0{0,8}HH;?` where HH is a hex number, can be bypassed by using more than 8 leading zeros.  For example, `&#x00000000000000074;` will bypass the regex but will still be decoded as `t`.
*   The vulnerable input is then output to the page via `echo`, without proper sanitization.
*   A sample payload provided is: `<a href="javascrip&#x0000000000000000074;:prompt(1)">x</a>`.
*   An incomplete blacklist in Tiki-Wiki allows using `<details open ontoggle=prompt(1)>` to trigger an XSS attack.
