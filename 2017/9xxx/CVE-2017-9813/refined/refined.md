Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-9813:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2017-9813 within a larger advisory (CORE-2017-0003) detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux File Server.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2017-9813 is the improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `scriptName` parameter in the `licenseKeyInfo` action method of the web management console is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This means that an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the parameter, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Code Execution:** While the initial XSS is reflected, it could lead to further exploitation, including session hijacking or potentially further malicious activity by running code in the context of a user's browser.
   - **Security Bypass:** Successful exploitation of XSS could allow attackers to bypass security controls.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network/Remote:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable `scriptName` parameter. The attacker needs to get a user to click a malicious URL to trigger the cross-site scripting.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Ability to Craft a URL:** The attacker must be able to construct a URL containing the malicious script payload in the `scriptName` parameter.
   - **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a logged in user to visit the crafted URL via social engineering or other means, as the exploit is reflected.
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated directly to the web management interface.

**Technical Details:**

The advisory includes the following example of the vulnerable URL:

```
http://<server IP>:9080/cgi-bin/cgictl?action=licenseKeyInfo&do_action=licenseKeyInfo&scriptName=</script><img+src%3dx+onerror%3d"alert(1)"%3b/>&active=&licenseKey=bla
```

In this example, the payload `</script><img+src%3dx+onerror%3d"alert(1)"%3b/>` is injected into the `scriptName` parameter. When a victim visits this URL, their browser will execute the JavaScript code, displaying an alert box (as a proof of concept). An attacker can replace this payload with more malicious code for further exploitation.
