{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code does not check if the session variable `$_SESSION['captcha']['code']` is set before comparing it to the user-provided captcha input in `/reg.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Captcha bypass vulnerability due to missing check for the existence of the session variable containing the captcha code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the captcha check during user registration, allowing them to create accounts without solving a captcha, potentially leading to spam or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to `/reg.php` with an empty `captcha` field, and ensuring there is no pre-existing session captcha code set (e.g., by not accessing the page via a GET request before)",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to `/reg.php` and does not require any prior authentication or special privileges."
