Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-9109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the `adns` library's failure to properly handle "apparent answers" in DNS responses, specifically when these answers appear before the first resource record (RR) that was found during the initial scan of the response. This can lead to confusion when interleaving answers for a CNAME target with the CNAME record itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The main vulnerability is an out-of-bounds access, caused by the library incorrectly parsing DNS responses and potentially reading beyond the allocated memory buffer when handling interleaved CNAME and target records. Specifically the library is confused when interleaved answers for the CNAME target, with the CNAME itself. This results in a heap buffer overflow

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
   - A heap buffer overflow
   - Remote code execution, as stated in the fix comment.
   -  The possibility of crashing the application using `adns`.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable through the local recursive resolver, meaning it can be triggered by manipulating DNS responses received by the system using `adns`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be in a position to influence the DNS responses that the vulnerable system receives. The attacker does not require any privileges. This could involve:
- A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attack.
- The attacker would need to be able to manipulate the responses that are coming from a nameserver, and be able to insert "apparent" answers before the "real" answers

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `adns` versions prior to 1.5.2.
- The fix involves ensuring that the library correctly ignores apparent answers before the first valid RR, focusing only on RRs that come after a CNAME record.
- Several SUSE and openSUSE products were affected by this vulnerability, and updates were released to address it.
- Fedora also released updates for this vulnerability, alongside others found by AFL 2.35b.
- The bug was found using AFL and the university of Cambridge.
- RedHat has also acknowledged the bug, but marked it as for informational purposes only.
