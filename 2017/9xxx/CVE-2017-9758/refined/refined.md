- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Some versions of the Savitech USB audio driver package silently install a root CA certificate (SaviAudio root CA certificate) into the Windows trusted root certificate store. This certificate was originally used for driver signing under Windows XP but was not removed from installers for later operating systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  Installation of an unnecessary root CA certificate within a driver package without user consent
    -  Potential for the private key associated with the installed root CA certificate to be compromised
- **Impact of exploitation**: If the private key associated with the installed root CA certificate is compromised, an attacker could:
    - Impersonate websites and services
    - Sign and install malicious software
    - Decrypt network traffic and other data through man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Compromise of the private key associated with the root CA certificate
    -  Exploitation of the installed root CA certificate by a threat actor with control of the private key
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the Savitech private key material and the ability to perform actions such as man-in-the-middle attacks. They would be in a powerful position to perform a number of attacks.
