Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the PJSIP library's multi-part body parser. A logical error exists when handling zero-length body parts within a multipart message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Incorrect Boundary Guessing:** If the Content-Type header lacks a boundary parameter, PJSIP attempts to guess the boundary by inspecting the body. This may result in incorrect guesses.
2.  **Improper Delimiter Handling:** PJSIP does not strictly adhere to RFC 2046 Section 5.1.1 when searching for delimiters between multipart body parts. It doesn't correctly handle whitespace after the boundary, and interprets content after the boundary as a delimiter.
3.  **Zero-Length Body Part Handling Error:** When a zero-length body part is encountered, a logical error leads to an incorrect length calculation (resulting in a negative number interpreted as a very large positive unsigned integer), causing out-of-bounds memory access during parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A specially crafted SIP message can trigger the vulnerability, leading to a crash in applications that use the PJSIP library, such as Asterisk. This results in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious SIP INVITE message with a crafted multipart body to a vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to a vulnerable service. No authentication is required, making it exploitable remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is primarily within the PJSIP library, not specifically in Asterisk, but affects Asterisk because it bundles PJSIP.
- The vulnerability can be triggered even without the presence of invalid characters like backticks in the header, but also with malformed multipart bodies.
- The fix involves special handling for zero-length body parts and is described in the provided information. The incorrect delimiter handling and boundary guessing could be addressed, but may be needed for interoperability reasons.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3933-1) addresses this issue along with another vulnerability (CVE-2017-9372).
