Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `adns_rr_info` function within the adns library. Specifically, it's caused by a lack of proper validation for out-of-range integer values when formatting data from DNS responses, especially when handling SOA records.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core issue is the potential for a buffer overflow.  The code uses `sprintf` to format integers into a fixed-size buffer. If an input integer is outside of the expected range, it can result in writing past the end of the buffer.
- **Integer Handling:** The code fails to check for and handle out-of-range integer values before using them in formatting operations. This is triggered by malformed SOA records. The sign-extended SOA values are out of range causing a buffer overflow when reconverted by `sprintf`.
- **Signed data type:** The use of a signed data type when handling SOA 32-bit integer fields contributes to the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a crash of the application using the adns library. This crash is due to the buffer overflow and the resulting memory corruption, leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Upstream DNS Data Sources:** The attack vector involves malicious or crafted DNS responses. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered when a DNS server provides responses with out-of-range integer values in the SOA (Start of Authority) record.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to control or manipulate DNS responses that the vulnerable adns library receives. This means the attacker could be an authoritative DNS server, or a man-in-the-middle attacker capable of injecting malicious DNS responses.
- The vulnerable application must be making SOA queries to be susceptible to exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with AFL (American Fuzzy Lop).
- The fix involves implementing checks before integer conversion to ensure the input values are within the permitted range, returning an error (`adns_s_invaliddata`) if not.
