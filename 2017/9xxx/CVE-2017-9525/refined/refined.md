Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9525:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `postinst` maintainer script of the `cron` package on Debian and Ubuntu. This script is responsible for setting up the environment for the cron daemon and crontab files. The script uses `chown` and `chmod` commands within a loop to set the correct ownership and permissions for files inside `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` directory. This is done unconditionally, which leads to a symlink attack vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Usage of `chown` and `chmod`:** The `postinst` script uses `ls` and `xargs` to iterate through files in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` and apply `chown` and `chmod` commands to each file. This approach is vulnerable to symlink attacks. An attacker with `crontab` group privileges can create symbolic links to arbitrary files on the system within `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`.  The script blindly follows these symlinks and applies the ownership and permission changes.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The script doesn't check if the files in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` are legitimate crontab files or symbolic links. This lack of validation allows the attacker to manipulate the permissions and ownership of files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By creating symbolic links in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`, an attacker with `crontab` group privileges can escalate their privileges to `root`. They can make arbitrary files writable by the `crontab` group, or even by everyone using chmod, leading to the possibility of modifying system files.
*   **Arbitrary File Modification:** The attacker can change the ownership and permissions of files outside of `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`, potentially leading to system compromise or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Symbolic Links:** The primary attack vector is the creation of symbolic links within the `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` directory.
*   **`postinst` Script Trigger:** The exploit is triggered when the `postinst` script runs, which happens during package installation or upgrade, or when `dpkg-reconfigure cron` command is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **`crontab` Group Membership:** The attacker needs to be a member of the `crontab` group, which grants them write access to the `/var/spool/cron/crontabs` directory.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to create the symbolic links and trigger the `postinst` script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves ensuring that only regular files with the correct name and hard link count get their ownership and group changed and adding file parsing to cron and crontab utilities.
*   The vulnerability is a privilege separation bypass, meaning it is exploitable only after the attacker has obtained `crontab` group privileges, possibly through another vulnerability.
*   The issue was initially discovered by Qualys.
*   The `fs.protected_hardlinks` sysctl, which prevents hard link attacks, is enabled by default on Debian since Wheezy mitigating some aspects of the issue. However, it doesn't address symlink attacks in the postinst script.
*   The issue was fixed in cron versions 3.0pl1-129 (unstable), 3.0pl1-127+deb8u2 (jessie) and 3.0pl1-128+deb9u2 (stretch)
