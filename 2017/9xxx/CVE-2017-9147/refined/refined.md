Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `_TIFFVGetField` function within the libtiff library when processing a crafted TIFF image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code iterates through custom tag values (`td->td_customValues`) and accesses members via a pointer (`tv`). Due to a flaw in how the `tv` pointer is incremented or validated during the loop, an attempt to read `tv->info->field_tag`  occurs outside of the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read leads to a crash of the application (e.g., `tiffsplit`), which can be triggered by a crafted TIFF file. This can be exploited remotely.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3606-1) mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution with user privileges. While the provided content doesn't provide details on how this could be achieved, it suggests that the vulnerability might be exploitable beyond a simple crash under certain circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image file.
- An attacker could provide a malicious TIFF file via various channels (e.g. email, web upload) to a user or automated system that utilizes the vulnerable libtiff library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable system with the crafted TIFF file. This may be achieved through social engineering to get a user to open the file, or by exploiting a service that automatically processes user-supplied images.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `_TIFFVGetField` function in `tif_dir.c` line 1072 when accessing `tv->info->field_tag`.
- The code loops through custom tag values in a TIFF directory (`td->td_customValues`).
- A pointer `tv` is incremented, but the code does not properly check or validate if it remains within the bounds of allocated memory which causes an out-of-bounds read when accessing `tv->info->field_tag`.

This vulnerability is present in libtiff versions prior to the fixes released by Debian, Ubuntu and other distributions.
