The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9068.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper escaping of configuration values before inserting them into the database configuration form during the setup process of the MODX Revolution CMS. These configuration values can be provided by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied configuration values, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into the database configuration form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the configuration form. This code would then be executed within the browsers of users accessing the application's setup pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to provide specially crafted malicious configuration values via the application's setup process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to provide the malicious configuration values to the setup form of the MODX Revolution CMS. This likely implies that the attacker is at a point in the setup process where they can influence the parameters provided to the system.
