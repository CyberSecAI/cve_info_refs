The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9575.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This code may be derived from third-party libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. The applications do not properly verify the authenticity of the TLS certificates, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept the banking username and password of users logging into the affected applications.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to users' bank accounts, resulting in financial losses and privacy violations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be carried out by any individual within a short range (approximately 50â€“100 feet) of the victim's device.
- The attacker needs to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept network traffic between the application and the server.
- The attack can be performed wirelessly and silently.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be physically close to the victim (50-100 feet).
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic using tools like bettercap.
- The attacker needs to enable HTTPS sniffing and use a POST request parser to capture the credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions a list of 44 affected iOS applications, each associated with a separate CVE ID, including CVE-2017-9575, for "FVB Mobile Banking" application.
- The vulnerability can be tested using the `bettercap` tool, without any modifications to the tool itself or prerequisites, by enabling HTTPS sniffing and a POST request parser.
