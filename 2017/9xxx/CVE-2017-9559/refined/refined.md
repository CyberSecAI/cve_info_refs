The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9559.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. The code may be derived from third-party libraries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker within range (50-100 feet) can intercept banking usernames and passwords when users log into the affected applications.

**Attack vectors:**
- Wireless interception of network traffic during the login process using tools like bettercap.
- No modifications or prerequisites are needed on the target device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim's device.
- The attacker needs to be able to sniff network traffic, for example with bettercap, while enabling HTTPS sniffing and use the "POST" request parser.
