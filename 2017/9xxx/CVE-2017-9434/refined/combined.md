Subject: Crypto++ and invalid read in decompressor class

Hi Everyone,

Crypto++'s (<https://www.cryptopp.com/>) is a free and open source
library of cryptographic schemes originally written by Wei Dai. Smart
fuzzing revealed Crypto++'s Zinflate class, used by classes like
Gunzip and Inflator, could perform an out-of-bounds read when
decompressing data.

The out-of-bounds read occurs on a table with 30 elements. The table
is static and its storage is allocated in initialized memory. The
attacker can craft a ZIP file that allows a read of the last two
non-existent elements. We believe an attacker can only read 0-bytes
due to the storage allocation. We were not able to escalate it to a
write. We believe its a low risk finding.

We were not able to induce failures in other classes using the
techniques. Other classes include those that are related, like
compressors; and those which are unrelated, like public and private
keys.

The issue is being tracked by the library at
<https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/414>. The Gentoo folks
assigned CVE-2017-9434 to track the issue.

The fix is available in Master. It is also available for several
versions of the library at
<https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/414#issuecomment-300671740>
.

Jeff

## Description

[![@noloader](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3538226?u=254e47b655f2f85bc78c793cbc5a2f44331191fe&v=4&size=48)](/noloader)[noloader](https://github.com/noloader)opened [on May 10, 2017](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/414#issue-227809212)

We started fuzzing library classes. Its dumb fuzzing, and all we do is generate a random string and send it into a filter like `Inflator` or `Gunzip`. (There's some smartness for some of the classes, like ensuring data is formatted and magics are present).

It looks like `Inflator` is having some trouble. The assert below was added when we noticed some odd behavior.

```
Testing Compressors and Decompressors...

Assertion failed: zinflate.cpp(554): DecodeBody
zinflate.cpp:561:69: runtime error: index 31 out of bounds for type 'unsigned int [30]'
passed:  128 zips and unzips
Assertion failed: zinflate.cpp(554): DecodeBody
Assertion failed: zinflate.cpp(554): DecodeBody
passed:  128 deflates and inflates
passed:  128 zlib decompress and compress

```

Running the test suite under Address Sanitizer with garbage/random data results in the following. It looks like we have an out-of-bounds read. Its not clear if there's an accompanying write, or if it can be controlled by an attacker.

```

## Description

[![@noloader](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3538226?u=254e47b655f2f85bc78c793cbc5a2f44331191fe&v=4&size=48)](/noloader)[noloader](https://github.com/noloader)opened [on May 10, 2017](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/414#issue-227809212)

We started fuzzing library classes. Its dumb fuzzing, and all we do is generate a random string and send it into a filter like `Inflator` or `Gunzip`. (There's some smartness for some of the classes, like ensuring data is formatted and magics are present).

It looks like `Inflator` is having some trouble. The assert below was added when we noticed some odd behavior.

```
Testing Compressors and Decompressors...

Assertion failed: zinflate.cpp(554): DecodeBody
zinflate.cpp:561:69: runtime error: index 31 out of bounds for type 'unsigned int [30]'
passed:  128 zips and unzips
Assertion failed: zinflate.cpp(554): DecodeBody
Assertion failed: zinflate.cpp(554): DecodeBody
passed:  128 deflates and inflates
passed:  128 zlib decompress and compress

```

Running the test suite under Address Sanitizer with garbage/random data results in the following. It looks like we have an out-of-bounds read. Its not clear if there's an accompanying write, or if it can be controlled by an attacker.

```
Assertion failed: zinflate.cpp(554): DecodeBody

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-06-05 13:30:36 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-06-05 13:30:41 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1458790  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c2)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-11-16 19:30:11 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 25 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '25'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 25 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c3)  Jan Kurik    2018-05-31 07:54:45 UTC  ``` This bug has been reported against a Fedora version which is already unsuported. In compliance with FESCo decision how to handle EOL of Security issues [1], I am changing the version to '27', the latest supported release.  Please check whether this bug is still an issue on the '27' release. If you find this bug not being applicable on this release, please close it.  [1] <https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1736>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c4)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 15:22:51 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 27 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-05-22 06:05:51 UTC  ``` cryptopp-8.2.0-1.fc30 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-812b77ed2e>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c6)  Fedora Update System    2019-05-23 18:58:25 UTC  ``` cryptopp-8.2.0-1.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report. See [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for instructions on how to install test updates. You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-812b77ed2e>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c7)  Fedora Update System    2019-06-01 00:51:35 UTC  ``` cryptopp-8.2.0-1.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1458792#c8)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2023-09-14 03:58:46 UTC  ``` The needinfo request[s] on this closed bug have been removed as they have been unresolved for 1000 days   ``` |  |
