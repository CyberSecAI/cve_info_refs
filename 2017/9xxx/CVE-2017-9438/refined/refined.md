Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-9438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `_yr_re_emit` function within the `libyara/re.c` file of the YARA project. This function is responsible for processing regular expressions within YARA rules, particularly when handling hex strings. A crafted YARA rule containing specific hex string patterns can cause excessive recursion in the `_yr_re_emit` function, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Consumption:** The primary weakness is the uncontrolled stack consumption due to the recursive nature of `_yr_re_emit` when handling malicious hex strings.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation or handling of specially crafted hex string patterns within YARA rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation results in a stack overflow, causing the YARA process to crash. This leads to a denial of service, preventing the use of YARA for its intended purpose.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted YARA Rules:** The attack vector involves creating a YARA rule containing hex strings designed to trigger the excessive recursion in `_yr_re_emit`.
*   **Malicious Rule Scanning:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted YARA rule to be scanned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide YARA Rules:** The attacker must have the ability to provide YARA rules to the vulnerable system or application.
*   **No special system privileges:** The vulnerability is triggered by the parsing logic itself.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is related to how `_yr_re_emit` processes hex strings, which can lead to unbounded recursion with certain crafted inputs.
*   The fix implemented in commit `10e8bd3071677dd1fa76beeef4bc2fc427cea5e7` modifies the `hex_grammar.c`, `hex_grammar.h`, and `hex_grammar.y` files to address the stack overflow.
*   The vulnerability is present in YARA version 3.5.0 and is fixed in version 3.6.0.
*   The fix involves changes to the hex string parsing logic to prevent excessive recursion.
*   The provided github commit diff highlights the changes made to `hex_grammar.y` to limit the number of nested expressions using `incr_ast_levels()` to prevent a stack overflow.
