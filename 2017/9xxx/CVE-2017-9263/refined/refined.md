{
  "CVE-2017-9263": {
    "Description": "While parsing an OpenFlow role status message Open vSwitch (OvS), a call to the abort() function for undefined role status reasons in the function 'ofp_print_role_status_message' in 'lib/ofp-print.c' could be misused for a remote denial of service attack by a malicious switch.",
    "Root cause": "The `ofp_print_role_status_message` function in Open vSwitch's `lib/ofp-print.c` calls `abort()` when it encounters an unknown reason code in a role status message.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of unexpected input",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Use of `abort()` in a message printing function"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious or buggy switch sending a crafted role status message with an invalid reason code can cause Open vSwitch to abort, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "OpenFlow protocol messages sent from a malicious or buggy switch"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send OpenFlow control messages to Open vSwitch",
        "The attacker needs to be a malicious or buggy switch connected to an OVS instance"
    ]
  }
