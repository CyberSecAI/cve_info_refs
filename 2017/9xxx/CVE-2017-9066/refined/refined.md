Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerabilities related to CVE-2017-9066:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4090-1 explicitly lists `CVE-2017-9066` as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the WordPress security update.
* The WordPress 4.7.5 Security and Maintenance Release also lists an "Insufficient redirect validation in the HTTP class" which matches the vulnerability description for CVE-2017-9066.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **insufficient redirect validation in the HTTP class** of WordPress. This means that the system wasn't properly checking the validity of URLs used in redirects, which could lead to malicious outcomes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Redirect Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of redirect URLs within the WordPress HTTP class.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability could allow for several kinds of attacks:
    *   **Redirect Attacks**: By manipulating the redirect URL, an attacker could potentially redirect users to a malicious website or page to conduct phishing attacks or download malware.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Though not explicitly stated, inadequate redirect validation could be exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to inject malicious scripts into the context of a trusted website. This is suggested by the general nature of the fixes applied in version 4.7.5 which includes XSS fixes
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Though not specific to this CVE, the Debian advisory includes SSRF in the list of potential attacks from other vulnerabilities fixed in the same update. This suggests similar vulnerabilities may exist and, when combined with a failure to properly validate the redirect URLs, could lead to SSRF exploitation where an attacker could use the vulnerable server to make requests to internal resources or other servers.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests that involve redirects within the WordPress application. An attacker could craft malicious URLs designed to exploit the lack of validation during a redirect.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need the ability to influence or manipulate the redirect URLs used by the WordPress site. This could involve various techniques like:
    *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking users into clicking a malicious link
    *   **Compromising a Website**:  Gaining control over a website's content that links to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
    *   **Intercepting Traffic**: Man-in-the-middle attacks might be used to modify redirect requests

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved adding a `validate_redirects` function to `wp-includes/class-http.php`. This function uses `wp_http_validate_url()` to check if the redirect URL is safe. It throws an exception if the URL is not valid.
*  The code changes commit `76d77e9` shows the implementation of this validation.

**Summary**
CVE-2017-9066 describes an insufficient redirect validation vulnerability in WordPress's HTTP class. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to redirect users to malicious sites. The fix implemented in WordPress 4.7.5 introduces the use of `wp_http_validate_url` to properly validate redirect URLs.
