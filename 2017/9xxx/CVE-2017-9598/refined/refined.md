The provided content is relevant to CVE-2017-9598. It describes a vulnerability affecting the "Morton Credit Union Mobile Banking" iOS application, which is specifically listed with this CVE ID.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This is suspected to be due to third-party code used by multiple apps.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is improper TLS certificate validation. This allows for a "Man-in-the-Middle" (MitM) attack by bypassing the security of HTTPS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to intercept the banking username and password of a user of the affected application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a MitM attack where the attacker intercepts communication between the mobile device and the banking server. This can be achieved through a rogue Wi-Fi access point or other methods of network traffic interception.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim during their login attempt to intercept the network traffic. The range is estimated to be around 50-100 feet. The attacker needs to be able to intercept and analyze network traffic. They would use tools like Bettercap to perform the attack by enabling HTTPS sniffing and parsing POST requests.
