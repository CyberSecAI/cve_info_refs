Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation on the `redirect` parameter within the `identification.php` file of the Piwigo application. This allows an attacker to control where a user is redirected after authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The application does not validate the provided URL in the `redirect` parameter, allowing it to redirect to arbitrary external websites. This is a classic case of an Open Redirect vulnerability (CWE-601).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker can craft a malicious link that, upon successful authentication, redirects a user to a fake login page or any other malicious website controlled by the attacker. This can be used to steal credentials or install malware, as well as other social engineering attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `redirect` parameter in the URL of the authentication page. The vulnerable parameter is included within the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs no special privileges and does not need to be authenticated initially, as it affects the login page where all unauthenticated users are directed.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious redirect parameter value.
*   The attacker requires the victim to successfully authenticate to the Piwigo application after clicking the malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability was identified in Piwigo version 2.9.0 and likely prior versions.
*   The issue was reported by Eric Fernando Casta√±eda Nazario from wizlynx group.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.9.1, according to the github issue.
