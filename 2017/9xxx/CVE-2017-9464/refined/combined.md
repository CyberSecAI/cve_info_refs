## **Description**

An Open Redirect vulnerability exists on the login form due to lack of input validation on redirect parameter, allowing a remote attacker to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via the redirect parameter in piwigo/identification.php

If an unauthenticated user tries to get access to an internal page or feature of the piwigo application, he or she is redirected to an authentication page.

The following image shows a redirection after an attempt to get access to *localhost/piwigo/admin.php* without a valid session.

The screenshot below shows the application redirected us to the authentication page and added the parameter **redirect** in the URL that points to */piwigo/admin.php*

[![](../../content/images/vuln/piwigo_redirect_2.png)](../../content/images/vuln/piwigo_redirect_2.png)

The **redirect**âs value is inserted into login form

Modifying the **redirect** parameterâs original value to an a arbitrary value triggers a redirect to an external site upon successful authentication as demonstrated below with:

*/piwigo/identification.php?redirect=https://www.google.com/robots.txt*

[![](../../content/images/vuln/piwigo_redirect_4.png)](../../content/images/vuln/piwigo_redirect_4.png)

When a valid user is successfully authenticated is redirected to an external site.

The image below shows a Request

The following image shows a Redirect Response on header Location (302 HTTP Code)

## Description

[![@plegall](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9326959?u=3227d666e9296ceba7214e61bc163791e11a9742&v=4&size=48)](/plegall)[plegall](https://github.com/plegall)opened [on Jun 14, 2017](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/issues/706#issue-235796803)

The `$_POST['redirect']` system in identification.php can lead to redirect outside Piwigo. On any location actually. To avoid any "open redirect" security issue, Piwigo should make sure the redirection occurs only with Piwigo, not outside.
