{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `get_unwind_section_word` function within `readelf.c`. A faulty check for invalid word offsets in ARM unwind information could lead to out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect bounds checking",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted ELF file with malformed ARM unwind information can trigger a heap-buffer-overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted ELF file",
      "Exploiting the parsing of ARM unwind information"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to craft a malicious ELF file",
      "Ability to entice a user to run the affected binutils tool"
