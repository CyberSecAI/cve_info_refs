>> line 50 means that the variable $previousUrl is from browser side, so it can be controlled by user.

>>line 54 means that web server side has no checking on $previousUrl before writing it to the response html, so if $previousUrl contains javascript code, the code will be executed on the browser side.

So if a attacker construct a special url as follow and send it to a victim, when the victim click the url, the code which is contained in the url will be executed on the victim's browser side to do some evil.
