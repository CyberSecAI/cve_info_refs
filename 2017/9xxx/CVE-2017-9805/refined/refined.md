Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9805:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided text snippets mention CVE-2017-9805 multiple times, specifically in the context of:

*   Apache Struts 2 framework vulnerability
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the REST plugin and XStream handler.
*   NetApp products using vulnerable Apache Struts libraries
*   Red Hat acknowledging the vulnerability
*   A Metasploit module that exists for the exploit

These details are all consistent with the public description of CVE-2017-9805 as an Apache Struts RCE vulnerability. Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Information**

Here's a breakdown of extracted information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause lies in the insecure deserialization of untrusted XML data by the Apache Struts REST plugin's XStream handler. Specifically, the XStream handler was not filtering types during deserialization of XML payloads, which enables the attacker to inject malicious code
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   *   **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the improper handling of XML data during deserialization using the XStream library.
   *   **Lack of Type Filtering:** The absence of type filtering during deserialization allows an attacker to introduce arbitrary code via a malicious XML payload.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server in the context of the Struts application.
    *   **System Compromise:** RCE could potentially lead to complete system compromise.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While the primary impact is RCE, the use of vulnerable versions of the Apache Struts URLValidator component can also lead to DoS via excessive CPU consumption.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious XML Payload:** Attackers send specially crafted XML payloads to the vulnerable server's REST endpoint.
    *   **File Uploads:** Attackers can also leverage file uploads to inject malicious code to the server via the REST plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring authentication.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Struts server.

**3. Additional Details (beyond the CVE description)**

The provided content offers additional details not always found in a standard CVE description:

*   **Affected Software Versions:** Specific Apache Struts versions (2.1.2 through 2.3.33 and 2.5 through 2.5.12) are identified as vulnerable.
*   **Exploit Availability:** Mentions the existence of a public exploit module for Metasploit, as well as a researcher's blog post with additional details
*   **Workarounds and Mitigation:** It is mentioned that removing the Struts REST plugin can be an effective mitigation, along with configuration changes to limit the handling of XML payloads.
*   **Vendor Responses:** Details vendor responses, such as NetApp's vulnerability advisory, a Red Hat bugzilla entry, and Apache's own statement, including mitigation recommendations.
*    **NetApp Remediation:** The NetApp content provides affected and non-affected product lists and fixed release information, along with specific vulnerabilities for each product using the vulnerable Apache Struts libraries.
*   **GitHub Deprecation:** Indicates that LGTM.com will be shut down, with its functionalities being integrated into GitHub code scanning.
*   **RedHat clarification:** A Red Hat statement clarified that while Struts 2 is not actively used in Red Hat final products, source code imports which includes struts2-core have been part of source code packages, which could potentially affect customers.

**4. Summary of Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**

The key vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization during XML deserialization. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending crafted XML payloads to the Struts REST plugin.

**5. Impact Summary**

The impact of this vulnerability is severe due to the potential for remote code execution, which can allow a threat actor to gain complete control of a system. This can result in data breaches, system manipulation, or denial of service.
