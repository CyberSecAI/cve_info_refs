The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9585.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This code is potentially derived from third-party libraries included in the applications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept banking usernames and passwords while users log in to the affected applications.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be conducted wirelessly within a short range (50-100 feet) of the victim.
- The attacker intercepts the network traffic (specifically POST requests with login credentials) using a tool such as `bettercap`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker needs to have access to a tool like bettercap and enable HTTPS sniffing with POST request parsing.
