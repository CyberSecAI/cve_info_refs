The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9552.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `synophoto_dsm_user` executable, part of the Synology PhotoStation package, was leaking NAS user passwords on the command line.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Credentials were being passed as command line arguments to a process (`synophoto_dsm_user`).
- The `synophoto_dsm_user` executable was not properly handling sensitive information, specifically user passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain access to user passwords for users with PhotoStation enabled.
- This access could potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the NAS and potentially other systems that use the same password.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could use a shell loop to repeatedly run `ps ax | grep synophoto_dsm_user` to capture credentials being passed on the command line.
- While shell access (ssh or telnet) is not enabled by default, an attacker who has gained shell access, could easily extract the passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs shell access on the NAS device. This is not enabled by default, so the attacker would need to have either compromised another service to gain shell access, or already have admin access to the system.
- Ability to run shell commands, specifically `ps` and `grep`.
