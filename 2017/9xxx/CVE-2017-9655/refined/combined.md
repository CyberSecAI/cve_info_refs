Last RevisedAugust 08, 2017
Alert CodeICSA-17-220-01

### **CVSS v3 9.8**

**ATTENTION:** Remotely exploitable/low skill level to exploit.

**Vendor:** OSIsoft

**Equipment:** PI Integrator

**Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting, Improper Authorization

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of PI Integrator, a data management platform, are affected:

* PI Integrator for SAP HANA 2016,
* PI Integrator for Business Analytics 2016 - Data Warehouse (All Editions),
* PI Integrator for Business Analytics 2016 - Business Intelligence (All Editions),
* PI Integrator for Business Analytics and SAP HANA SQL Utility 2016, and
* PI Integrator for Microsoft Azure 2016.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthorized attacker to gain privileged access to the system. An attacker may also be able to store a malicious script in the application database.

## MITIGATION

OSIsoft recommends that users update their software at the earliest opportunity. Users and administrators are encouraged to upgrade to PI Integrator for Business Analytics 2016 R2 or later, PI Integrator for Microsoft Azure 2016 R2 SP1 or later, or PI Integrator for SAP HANA 2017 or later for the corresponding edition.

OSIsoft has released an alert that can be found at:

<https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/Alerts/AL00324>

NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT web site](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
