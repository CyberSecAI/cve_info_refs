This content relates to CVE-2017-9560.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected iOS applications. It is potentially derived from third-party code included in these apps.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the improper validation of TLS certificates, which allows for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This occurs because the affected applications don't correctly verify the authenticity of the server they are communicating with.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to silently intercept the banking username and password of a user logging into the affected application. This allows the attacker to gain full control of the user's banking account.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is performed wirelessly using a MITM approach. An attacker needs to be within range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the victim's device while the user is logging into the affected banking application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim and needs to be able to intercept network traffic using tools such as `bettercap` with HTTPS sniffing enabled and set to parse POST requests. No modifications to the targeted application is required.
