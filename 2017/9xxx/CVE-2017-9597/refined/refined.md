The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9597. This CVE ID is associated with the "Blue Ridge Bank and Trust Co. Mobile Banking" application for iOS, version 3.0.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This code may be derived from a third-party library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the improper validation of TLS certificates. This weakness allows for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting the communication between the mobile application and the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to silently intercept banking usernames and passwords when a user logs into the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. An attacker positioned within wireless range of the victim (approximately 50-100 feet) can intercept the network traffic and extract the login credentials if the TLS certificate validation is not done properly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim using the vulnerable application and have the ability to intercept the network traffic. This can be achieved using tools like bettercap to perform the MITM attack. No prior knowledge of the victim is required besides the use of the vulnerable application.
