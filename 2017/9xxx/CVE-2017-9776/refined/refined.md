  "CVE-2017-9776": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the file JBIG2Stream.cc within the function JBIG2Bitmap::combine.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerability leading to a heap overflow."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a heap overflow vulnerability, potentially allowing an attacker to control the heap. Different samples can corrupt the heap in various ways, potentially leading to a double free or errors during memory allocation and deallocation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted PDF file. Specifically, the attacker can control the variables y, line, and x, to trigger the overflow.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a crafted PDF file with specific high values for y, line, and x."
  }
