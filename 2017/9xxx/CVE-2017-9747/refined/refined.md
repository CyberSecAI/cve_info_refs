Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `bfd_get_string` function within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically when processing IEEE binary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stack buffer overflow:** The `bfd_get_string` function is writing more data into a stack buffer than it has allocated, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the `objdump` utility due to the buffer overflow. The AddressSanitizer report confirms memory corruption and a crash.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted binary file:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted IEEE binary file that contains a malformed string, leading to the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to provide a crafted file:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious IEEE binary file as input to the `objdump` utility. This could be done through various means, such as social engineering, or through a software that processes user-provided files.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `bfd/ieee.c` file, specifically in `bfd_get_string` (line 198), `read_id` (line 227) and `ieee_object_p` (line 1907), as well as other functions higher up the call stack.
- The bug was found during fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and AddressSanitizer.
- The affected version is binutils 2.29
- The issue was resolved by using a static buffer in `ieee_archive_p` to avoid the overflow
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available for download.
