Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is used to secure Struts actions. Specifically, it occurs when secured and unsecured actions are mixed within the same class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core vulnerability is a DoS attack. The flaw allows attackers to trigger excessive resource consumption, rendering the application unavailable.
*   The vulnerability is related to how Spring AOP handles security in Struts actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS by exploiting the vulnerability, making the application unusable for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, meaning it can be triggered remotely.
*   **HTTP:** The vulnerability is related to the handling of HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Low Privileges:**  The attacker requires only low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** Apache Struts versions 2.3.7 through 2.3.32, and 2.5 through 2.5.10.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading to Apache Struts versions 2.5.12 or 2.3.33 fixes the issue.
*   **Workaround:** A workaround involves adding a specific constant (`struts.additional.excludedPatterns`) to the `struts.xml` file.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3 (Medium), with an attack vector of "Network," low attack complexity, low privilege required, no user interaction, no scope change, and a high availability impact.
*   The vulnerability affects Spring secured actions.
*   The Oracle document states that this CVE is addressed by the fix for CVE-2017-9805, along with other CVEs.

**Summary of Information from Different Sources:**

*   The Apache Struts wiki page (struts.apache.org) provides the core details about the vulnerability, its impact, affected versions, and mitigation steps.
*   The Oracle security advisory mentions that they are distributing fixes for this CVE along with other Struts vulnerabilities, and that this issue is addressed by their patch for CVE-2017-9805.
*   The NetApp advisory confirms the vulnerability in their products that use vulnerable versions of Struts and provides a list of affected products as well as the CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).
