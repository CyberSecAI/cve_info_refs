- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DAAP dissector (`dissect_daap_one_tag`) in Wireshark has a recursion issue. Specifically, the dissector doesn't correctly handle nested tags within DAAP packets, leading to excessive recursion and eventually exhausting the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled recursion in the DAAP dissector function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Stack exhaustion, which can lead to a crash of the Wireshark application. In some cases, depending on the operating system, this may result in denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafting a malicious DAAP packet with deeply nested tags, and then opening that malformed packet in Wireshark.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed pcap file to the victim which contains the crafted DAAP packet. The victim needs to open this file using a vulnerable version of Wireshark.
