  "cve": "CVE-2017-9210",
  "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in qpdf, a command-line program for PDF transformations, which results in an infinite loop. This specific vulnerability is identified as CVE-2017-9210.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the `QPDF_Name::normalizeName` function, specifically how it handles certain malformed PDF files during unparsing. This results in a stack overflow due to an infinite recursion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop",
      "Stack overflow",
      "Incorrect handling of malformed PDF structures during unparsing"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted PDF file to cause a denial of service. The program enters an infinite loop, consuming excessive stack space and ultimately crashing.",
     "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a malformed PDF file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the `qpdf` tool.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted PDF file to the vulnerable qpdf program."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "6.0.0"
  ],
    "fixed_versions": "The vulnerability was fixed in a later version of qpdf through several commits, which addressed the infinite loop issue.",
