SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow /tmp/portage/media-gfx/autotrace-0.31.1-r8/work/autotrace-0.31.1/input-tga.c:538:33 in ReadImage
```

**Reproducer:**

HEAP-input-tga.c-538-33.TGA

**CVE:**

CVE-2017-9195

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Heap-buffer-overflow in `input-tga.c:538`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow. The AddressSanitizer output shows a read of size 1 at a memory location which is a wild pointer, indicating the memory is not properly allocated or has already been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash due to an invalid memory access (READ of size 1). This can lead to denial of service. In some cases, heap-buffer-overflows may be exploited for arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly shown here.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted TGA image file as input to the `autotrace` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker must be able to supply a malicious .TGA file to the autotrace application.
