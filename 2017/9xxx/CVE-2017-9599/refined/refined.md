The provided content discusses a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS banking applications, including the "Fountain Trust Mobile Banking" app which is associated with CVE-2017-9599.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This code is potentially derived from a third-party library. The vulnerability allows for a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack due to improper certificate validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation.
- Use of vulnerable third-party code.
- Lack of proper certificate pinning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Login credentials (username and password) can be silently intercepted by an attacker.
- Users' banking information is exposed.
- Potential financial loss or fraud for the users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.
- Attacker positioned within wireless range (50-100 feet) of the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical proximity to the victim (within wireless range).
- Ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic (e.g., using tools like bettercap).
- No modifications to the victim's device or application needed.
- Ability to capture POST requests that contain the login credentials.
