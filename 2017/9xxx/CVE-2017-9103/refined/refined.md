{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `pap_mailbox822` function in adns does not properly validate the `st` variable obtained from `adns__findlabel_next`. This leads to the use of an uninitialized stack value as the first label length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Use of uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially cause the application using adns to crash, leak memory contents, allocate excessive memory, or cause a buffer overflow. This is achievable when making non-raw queries for SOA or RP records.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks by controlling DNS responses",
      "Specifically crafted DNS responses from a malicious nameserver."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to control DNS responses",
        "Must have control or be a malicious DNS server."
