{
  "CVE-2017-9286": {
    "Description": "The packaging of NextCloud in openSUSE used /srv/www/htdocs in an unsafe manner, which could have allowed scripts running as wwwrun user to escalate privileges to root during nextcloud package upgrade.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Nextcloud package in openSUSE used the /srv/www/htdocs directory in an unsafe manner which allowed unprivileged users to write to directories used by the root process, leading to symlink attacks during package upgrades.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of /srv/www/htdocs directory",
      "Insecure use of /tmp directory",
      "Scripts running as wwwrun user can create symlinks",
        "Package scripts writing to user-owned directories",
        "Use of 'su' command in scriptlets may be insecure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation from wwwrun user to root",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability during nextcloud package upgrade",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have write access to locations where root process writes to, typically within the /srv/www/htdocs directory. Attacker needs to be a local user on the system to perform a symlink attack."
