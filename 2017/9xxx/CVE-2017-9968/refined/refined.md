CVE-2017-9968:

- Root cause: The IGSS Mobile app lacks certificate pinning during the TLS/SSL connection establishing process.
- Weakness: Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)
- Impact: An attacker can execute a man-in-the-middle attack.
- Attack vector: Exploiting the lack of certificate pinning during TLS/SSL connection.
- Required attacker capabilities: The advisory indicates "locally exploitable/low skill level to exploit." This suggests the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device or be able to intercept network traffic. The attacker also needs to be able to present a malicious certificate to the application.
