| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=21591#c0)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 22:29:28 UTC  ``` Hello there,  I have been fuzzing objdump with American Fuzzy Lop and AddressSanitizer.  Please find attached the minimized file causing the issue ("Input") and the ASAN report log ("Output"). Below is the reduced stacktrace with links to the corresponding source lines on a GitHub mirror.  The command used was `objdump -D <file>`. The compilation flags used were `-g -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -fno-sanitize-recover=undefined`. The configuration settings used were `--enable-targets=all --disable-shared`.  Let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.  --  Input: 2304d75a49df935290e0c4edef5779a1.52037608e08ea640c3ff19ec097f9e72.min Output: 2304d75a49df935290e0c4edef5779a1.52037608e08ea640c3ff19ec097f9e72.txt  Error in "versados_scan": SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000 (pc 0x00000173e11e bp 0x7fffffffe130 sp 0x7fffffffdda0 T0)   in versados_scan at bfd/versados.c:538     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/bfd/versados.c#L538>)   in versados_object_p at bfd/versados.c:645     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/bfd/versados.c#L645>)   in bfd_check_format_matches at bfd/format.c:311     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/bfd/format.c#L311>)   in display_object_bfd at binutils/objdump.c:3602     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L3602>)   in display_any_bfd at binutils/objdump.c:3693     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L3693>)   in display_file at binutils/objdump.c:3714     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L3714>)   in main at binutils/objdump.c:4016     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L4016>) ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=21591#c1)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 22:29:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10130](attachment.cgi?id=10130 "testcase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10130&action=edit "testcase") testcase ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=21591#c2)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 22:30:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10131](attachment.cgi?id=10131 "report") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10131&action=edit "report") report ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=21591#c3)  Sourceware Commits    2017-06-14 09:36:20 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Nick Clifton <nickc@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=04f963fd489cae724a60140e13984415c205f4ac>  commit 04f963fd489cae724a60140e13984415c205f4ac Author: Nick Clifton <nickc@redhat.com> Date:   Wed Jun 14 10:35:16 2017 +0100      Fix seg-faults in objdump when disassembling a corrupt versados binary.
