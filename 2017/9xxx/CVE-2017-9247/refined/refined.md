Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9247:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **unquoted service paths** in the Sierra Wireless Windows Mobile Broadband Driver Packages (MBDP).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unquoted service paths:** The service executable path isn't enclosed in quotation marks. This allows a malicious actor to insert an executable in a parent directory. When the service starts, Windows will try to execute an executable with the same name as the service executable from these parent directories.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Local privilege escalation:** A successful exploit could allow a malicious actor to gain elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **File system manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to write a malicious executable to a directory in the service's path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to directories in the service's path.
*   The attacker needs local access to the targeted machine.

**Summary:**

This CVE describes an unquoted service path vulnerability affecting Sierra Wireless Windows Mobile Broadband Driver Packages. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious executable into a directory in the service's path, leading to local privilege escalation.
