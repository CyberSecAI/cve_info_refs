The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9592, as it is listed as one of the affected applications in the advisory.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This likely arises from third-party code integrated into the apps.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This allows for a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack where a malicious actor can intercept and decrypt encrypted communications between the app and the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker within range can silently intercept a user's banking username and password while logging into the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Wireless network interception.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range (50-100 feet).
- The attacker must have the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, such as setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point or using tools like bettercap to intercept and decrypt the traffic.
- The attacker needs to be able to capture POST requests.
