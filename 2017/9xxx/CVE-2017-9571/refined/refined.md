The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9571.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected iOS applications. This issue is potentially derived from third-party code incorporated into these applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of TLS certificates within the mobile applications. This allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to silently intercept a user's banking username and password while they are logging into the affected application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a nearby attacker intercepting network traffic while a user is logging into an affected application. This requires the attacker to be within a certain range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be in close physical proximity to the victim (within approximately 50-100 feet) to intercept the network traffic. They also need the ability to perform a MitM attack, which can be done using tools like bettercap by enabling HTTPS sniffing and using the "POST" request parser.
