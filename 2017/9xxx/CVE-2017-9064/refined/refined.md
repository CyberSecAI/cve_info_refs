Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the filesystem credentials dialog within WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper CSRF protection when handling filesystem credentials in the dialog. This allows an attacker to potentially trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a form that modifies these credentials without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Credential Changes:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to change the filesystem credentials used by WordPress. This could lead to a variety of issues, including:
    -  Unauthorized file system access by the attacker
    -  Website defacement
    -  Malware injection
    -  Complete site compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted web page or link that, when clicked by an authenticated WordPress administrator, submits a forged request to change the filesystem credentials.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress server itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator to visit a malicious site or click a malicious link. This could be achieved through social engineering or other methods.
- The attacker does not need to know the existing credentials to carry out the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a nonce to the filesystem credentials form and validating it upon submission. This prevents forged requests from being processed.
- The specific code changes introduced in the commit involve:
    -  Adding and verifying the nonce `_fs_nonce` in `wp-admin/includes/file.php` during the handling of submitted form data
    -  Adding the nonce value to the Javascript that handles the filesystem credentials form in `wp-admin/js/updates.js`
- The vulnerability was present in WordPress versions 4.7.4 and earlier, and was addressed in version 4.7.5.
