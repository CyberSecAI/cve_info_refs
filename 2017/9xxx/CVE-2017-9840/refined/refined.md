**Root cause of vulnerability:** Unrestricted file upload vulnerability due to the application not properly validating file types, allowing low-privileged users to upload files of dangerous types.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.
*   **Insufficient File Extension Blocking:** While the application appends ".noexe" to uploaded PHP files, this is easily bypassed by renaming the file after upload.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Validation:** The application does not validate the file extension after the upload when the user renames the file

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading and renaming a PHP webshell, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the webserver.
*   **Full System Compromise**: Complete control over the affected system.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** High impact on all three, as an attacker can steal data, modify the application, and cause service disruptions.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the application's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Low-privileged User:** The attacker only needs a low-privilege account on the Dolibarr application.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker needs a web browser to interact with the application and upload the malicious file.
