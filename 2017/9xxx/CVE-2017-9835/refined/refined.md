Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9835:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `gs_alloc_ref_array` function within `psi/ialloc.c`. This occurs because the code uses a `ulong` to store the number of bytes to allocate, which can overflow on 32-bit systems when a size greater than 2^32 is passed to `alloc_obj`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in `gs_alloc_ref_array`.
- Integer overflow when calculating allocation size.
- Insufficient input validation of allocation sizes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application crash due to the heap buffer overflow).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process, as noted in the Gentoo advisory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation is achieved by processing a specially crafted PostScript file that triggers a large allocation. The crafted input needs to call the vulnerable function with an excessively large size that causes an integer overflow during memory allocation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PostScript file or PDF document to be processed by the Ghostscript interpreter. No special privileges are required by the attacker.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a binary object within a PostScript file when calling the function `scan_bos` inside `iscanbin.c`.
- The vulnerability is specifically noted to be triggered on 32-bit systems where the `ulong` overflow is more likely to occur.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) file that triggers the vulnerability was provided by Kim Gwan Yeong.
- A fix has been implemented by the Ghostscript team, and the commit ID `cfde94be1` resolves the issue.
- The Debian security advisory also confirms that multiple CVEs, including CVE-2017-9835, have been addressed in the updated packages.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory lists CVE-2017-9835 along with other vulnerabilities, recommending an upgrade to Ghostscript version 9.26 or later to resolve the issue.
