Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ReadPDBImage` function in the `pdb.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, it's a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The `ReadPDBImage` function allocates memory but fails to free it under certain conditions, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly processing crafted PDB files, an attacker can cause the application to leak memory, eventually exhausting available memory resources and leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PDB File:** The attacker provides a specially crafted PDB file as input to ImageMagick. This file triggers the memory leak within the `ReadPDBImage` function when it is processed by the `convert` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious PDB file to the ImageMagick application, likely through a command line argument or through a service using the library.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** While not explicitly required, awareness that the PDB image format is vulnerable within the `ReadPDBImage` function is helpful.
*   **Ability to Trigger the Convert command:** The attacker needs to trigger the ImageMagick `convert` command to initiate the image processing of the malicious PDB file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided stack trace clearly shows the allocation call `AcquireMagickMemory` is made within the `ReadPDBImage` function. The test case is a file provided in a GitHub repository.
*   The issue was reported against ImageMagick 7.0.5-5.

This issue is a classical memory leak scenario, which falls under CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory After Effective Lifetime.
