   There are ways to get around it that we will discuss one by one. Even though it is far from foolproof and requires some effort, one of the versatile and sneaky methods you could try is detoxing the hair. Detox Shampoo cleanses your scalp and penetrates deep into the hair follicles to remove drug toxins and is considered one of the best THC detox methods. Though there are several detox shampoos on the market, we will focus on two effective products. These premium hair cleansers, unlike normal shampoos, have been specially formulated to assist you in passing a hair toxicology test. • Old Style Aloe Toxin Rid - Best THC Detoxifying Shampoo It is the best hair follicle detox shampoo on the market. This drug-detoxifying shampoo is made with a proprietary blend of chemicals that remove drug metabolites such as THC from your hair. When it comes to passing hair tests, this shampoo is by far the most reliable product on the internet. Year after year, the steady stream of positive user reviews attests to its effectiveness. The shampoo itself is a thick gel that flows slowly and is easy to apply. The color is bright green in the bottle but fades quickly when lathered. Depending on the THC consumption and your digestive system’s acidic tolerance, take lemon juice diluted with an adequate amount of water every one to two hours. Mix a full tablespoon of lemon juice into 500 ml of water and drink it as much time as you feel comfortable. You must start this process at least a week before the scheduled drug test. It will effectively clean your urine from the THC content and is a natural remedy. You don’t have to be extra cautious with this method.
