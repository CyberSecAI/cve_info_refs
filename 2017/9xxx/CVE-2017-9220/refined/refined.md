The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2). Here's the breakdown for CVE-2017-9220:

**CVE-2017-9220**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `mp4ff_read_stco` function within `common/mp4ff/mp4atom.c`. The function reads an integer value from the input file to determine the number of chunk offsets, which it then uses to allocate memory. By providing a large value for the chunk offset count in a crafted MP4 file, an attacker can trigger an excessive memory allocation leading to a denial of service.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient validation of input data leading to excessive memory allocation.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service due to memory allocation failure. The application crashes due to the allocation failing.
*   **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted MP4 file is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide the crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application.
