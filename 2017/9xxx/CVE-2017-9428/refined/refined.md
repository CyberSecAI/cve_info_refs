{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application filters directory traversal attempts using '..' and '/' but fails to account for '\\' which is valid on Windows systems. The file browser allows traversal beyond the intended base directory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the file browser functionality. The application only filters '/' and '..' but not '\\', allowing a malicious user to escape the intended directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the server by traversing the file system outside the intended base directory. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure and potentially further compromise of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `/BigTree-CMS-4.2.18/site/index.php/admin/ajax/developer/extensions/file-browser/` with a crafted `directory` parameter containing `..\\` sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application with the required parameters. They also need to have a valid session to access the vulnerable endpoint, which in this case requires being logged into the admin panel of BigTree CMS."
