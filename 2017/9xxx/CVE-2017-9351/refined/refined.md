Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The DHCP dissector in Wireshark has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to reading past the end of a buffer. This occurs when processing malformed DHCP packets. The vulnerability is specifically triggered within the `strncmp` function which is used to compare strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** A heap buffer overflow occurs when the dissector tries to read more data than allocated from a heap buffer. This is caused by incorrect bounds checking within the dissector while handling DHCP packets.
*   **Incorrect String Comparison:** The use of `strncmp` might indicate a vulnerability related to parsing string data within the dissector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Crash:** Exploitation can lead to a crash of the Wireshark application.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, heap-based buffer overflows can sometimes be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution under specific circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malformed Packet Injection:** Attacker could inject a malformed DHCP packet onto the network.
*   **Malformed Packet Trace Files:** Attacker could convince a user to open a malformed packet trace file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** To inject malformed packets, the attacker would need to have network access where Wireshark is listening.
*   **Social Engineering:** To trick users into opening malicious packet trace files, some social engineering may be required.
*   **Knowledge of DHCP:** The attacker needs some knowledge of DHCP packet structure to craft a malformed packet.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The issue was discovered by the OSS-Fuzz project.
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.6 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.12.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark versions 2.2.7 and 2.0.13 and later.
*   The specific location of the vulnerability is within the `__interceptor_strncmp` function.
*   Multiple bug reports (13609 and 13628) were related to this vulnerability.
