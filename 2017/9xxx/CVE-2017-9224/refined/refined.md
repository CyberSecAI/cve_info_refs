{
  "CVE-2017-9224": {
    "Description": "A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in match_at() during regular expression searching. A logical error involving order of validation and access in match_at() could result in an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A logical error in the `match_at()` function allows an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack out-of-bounds read.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A single byte read beyond the end of the input string, which is stack-allocated.  Information about the byte read may under some circumstances be leaked to the attacker.  The impact is limited due to the single-byte read and the attacker's minimal control over the data and repeated exploitation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Malicious regular expression.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control the regular expression that will be compiled."
