Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The core issue stems from improper file permissions assigned to the "Authenticated Users" group, specifically the 'M' (Modify) or 'C' (Change) flags on the executable files related to the Automated Logic WebCTRL service and server. This allows authenticated users to modify or replace these executable files.
*   **Unquoted Search Path:** The application also suffers from an unquoted search path issue affecting the 'WebCTRL Service'. This can lead to a scenario where a malicious executable placed in a directory along the search path might get executed unintentionally instead of the intended binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for a local, authenticated user to escalate their privileges by replacing legitimate executable files with malicious ones.
*   **Insecure Permissions:** The presence of modify/change permissions for authenticated users on critical application executables.
*   **Unquoted Search Path:** The usage of an unquoted search path allows for an attacker to perform a DLL hijacking or similar attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation would enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the elevated privileges of the vulnerable application.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  By exploiting this, a local user can gain the same access as the application which usually runs with elevated privileges.
*   **Control System Compromise:** Given that the affected software is a building automation system, this could potentially lead to disruption or manipulation of critical building systems like HVAC, lighting, fire, and security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable application is installed.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system, although no elevated privileges are required.
*   **File Replacement:** The attacker exploits the insecure permissions and/or the unquoted search path vulnerability by overwriting existing application executable files with a malicious binary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** Physical or remote access to the target system.
*   **Basic User Account:** Must have a valid, authenticated user account on the targeted machine.
*   **File System Access:** Ability to modify the executable files or inject a malicious executable in a folder located in the search path.
*   **Technical Skill:** Ability to create malicious executable or script files to be executed in place of the legitimate files, and know the unquoted search path.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory mentions that the software is a building automation system (BAS) and is used worldwide.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko Krstic from Zero Science Lab.
*   The advisory includes the specific versions affected, and also includes mitigation patches.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.2 (unquoted search path) and is rated as local with low attack complexity.
*   There are no known public exploits specifically targeting these vulnerabilities, as of the advisory's release date.
