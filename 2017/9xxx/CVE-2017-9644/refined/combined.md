**Vulnerable App:**

```
Automated Logic WebCTRL 6.5 Insecure File Permissions Privilege Escalation

Vendor: Automated Logic Corporation
Product web page: http://www.automatedlogic.com
Affected version: ALC WebCTRL, i-Vu, SiteScan Web 6.5 and prior
                  ALC WebCTRL, SiteScan Web 6.1 and prior
                  ALC WebCTRL, i-Vu 6.0 and prior
                  ALC WebCTRL, i-Vu, SiteScan Web 5.5 and prior
                  ALC WebCTRL, i-Vu, SiteScan Web 5.2 and prior

Summary: WebCTRL®, Automated Logic's web-based building automation
system, is known for its intuitive user interface and powerful integration
capabilities. It allows building operators to optimize and manage
all of their building systems - including HVAC, lighting, fire, elevators,
and security - all within a single HVAC controls platform. It's everything
they need to keep occupants comfortable, manage energy conservation measures,
identify key operational problems, and validate the results.

Desc: WebCTRL server/service suffers from an elevation of privileges vulnerability
which can be used by a simple authenticated user that can change the executable
file with a binary of choice. The vulnerability exist due to the improper permissions,
with the 'M' flag (Modify) or 'C' flag (Change) for 'Authenticated Users' group.
The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue as well impacting the service
'WebCTRL Service' for Windows deployed as part of WebCTRL server solution. This could
potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt would require the
local user to be able to insert their code in the system root path undetected by the
OS or other security applications where it could potentially be executed during
application startup or reboot. If successful, the local user’s code would execute
with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT web site](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### Automated Logic WebCTRL 6.5 Insecure File Permissions Privilege Escalation

Title: Automated Logic WebCTRL 6.5 Insecure File Permissions Privilege Escalation

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2017-5429](ZSL-2017-5429.php)

Type: Local

Impact: Privilege Escalation

Risk: (3/5)

Release Date: 22.08.2017
##### Summary

WebCTRL®, Automated Logic's web-based building automation
system, is known for its intuitive user interface and powerful integration
capabilities. It allows building operators to optimize and manage
all of their building systems - including HVAC, lighting, fire, elevators,
and security - all within a single HVAC controls platform. It's everything
they need to keep occupants comfortable, manage energy conservation measures,
identify key operational problems, and validate the results.
##### Description

WebCTRL server/service suffers from an elevation of privileges vulnerability
which can be used by a simple authenticated user that can change the executable
file with a binary of choice. The vulnerability exist due to the improper permissions,
with the 'M' flag (Modify) or 'C' flag (Change) for 'Authenticated Users' group.
The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue as well impacting the service
'WebCTRL Service' for Windows deployed as part of WebCTRL server solution. This could
potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt would require the
local user to be able to insert their code in the system root path undetected by the
OS or other security applications where it could potentially be executed during
application startup or reboot. If successful, the local user’s code would execute
with the elevated privileges of the application.
