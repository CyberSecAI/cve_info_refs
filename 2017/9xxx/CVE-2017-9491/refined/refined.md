Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-9491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper use of HTTP cookie flags within the web applications running on the affected modem devices. Specifically, the cookies lack the security flags defined in the HTTP cookie standard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is the absence of proper security flags (e.g., HttpOnly and Secure) on cookies used by the affected modems' web administration interfaces.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact is not explicitly detailed but by not using the security flags, cookies may be vulnerable to exfiltration via JavaScript or via non-HTTPS connection. This could lead to session hijacking or other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate cookies due to the missing security flags. This could happen if the user connects via a non-HTTPS connection allowing a man-in-the-middle attack, or by using Cross-site scripting to steal cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to either intercept network traffic or execute JavaScript in the context of a user's browser session with the affected modem's web interface. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack on a non-HTTPS connection, or a cross site scripting attack.

**Additional Notes:**
The advisory explicitly states that this vulnerability is related to CVE-2017-9492 which indicates both vulnerabilities are related to improper cookie flags but on different devices.
The affected devices/firmware are:
*   Cisco DPC3939, firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421733-160420a-CMCST
*   Cisco DPC3939, firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421746-170221a-CMCST
*   Cisco DPC3939B, firmware version dpc3939b-v303r204217-150321a-CMCST
*  Cisco DPC3941T, firmware version DPC3941_2.5s3_PROD_sey
*  Arris TG1682G, eMTA&DOCSIS version 10.0.132.SIP.PC20.CT, software version TG1682_2.2p7s2_PROD_sey
The advisory suggests that this is a low severity vulnerability.
The advisory also recommends enabling the "HTTP only" flag on the appropriate cookies as a mitigation.
