Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in the WebUI component of Deluge. The application doesn't properly validate the requested file name when rendering templates. Specifically, the application does not verify if the provided name corresponds to an actual template file. This allows an attacker to request arbitrary files by manipulating the file path in the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The core vulnerability is the ability to traverse the file system by manipulating the requested file path. The vulnerability exists because the application doesn't restrict the file names to valid template files.
- **Insufficient Input Validation**: The Deluge application fails to validate the file names that are supplied to template rendering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access**: Attackers could potentially access sensitive files on the server by using directory traversal sequences in their requests to the web interface.
- **Potential for Further Compromise**: Depending on the server's configuration and the accessed files, the vulnerability could potentially allow further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious HTTP requests to the Deluge web interface.
- **Manipulated Filename:** Attackers would manipulate the filename parameter in the request to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) allowing them to access files outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Deluge web interface.
- **Understanding of Application:** The attacker needs to know how the web interface handles template rendering.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to verify if the requested template file exists, returning a 404 error if it does not.
- The issue was initially reported as an "important" severity, but later escalated to "serious" due to the security implications.
- Fixes were released in Deluge versions 1.3.15, 1.3.13+git20161130.48cedf63-3 (unstable), and 1.3.3-2+nmu1+deb7u2.

This information is more detailed than the original CVE description, which simply states a directory traversal vulnerability existed in the WebUI component.
