The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9205.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an invalid memory read in the `iw_get_ui16be` function within `imageworsener` when processing JPEG EXIF data. This function attempts to read a 16-bit big-endian value from a memory location, but due to insufficient bounds checking, it can read beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `iw_get_ui16be` function doesn't properly check if the read operation is within the bounds of the allocated memory. Specifically, when parsing the EXIF data, it reads 2 bytes without validating that the read will not go beyond the provided data length. This can lead to reading from uninitialized memory or a memory location outside the process's address space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Segmentation fault/crash:** An out-of-bounds read leads to a segmentation fault due to accessing invalid memory, resulting in a crash of the `imageworsener` application.
- **Potential information leak:** While not explicitly mentioned, an out-of-bounds read could also potentially expose sensitive information from other parts of the memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious image:** A crafted JPEG image containing specially crafted EXIF data is processed using `imageworsener`. The image is crafted such that during the parsing of EXIF data, the vulnerable `iw_get_ui16be` function attempts to read beyond the provided buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted JPEG image to the `imageworsener` application either directly, or through a service that processes images via `imageworsener`. No special permissions are required beyond the ability to execute the `imageworsener` application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs within the `iwjpeg_scan_exif_ifd` function, which is responsible for parsing EXIF data, and is triggered by a call to `iw_get_ui16be` function via the `iw_get_ui16_e` function.
- The fix involves adding bounds checking in helper functions to ensure that reads do not go beyond the provided data length, as demonstrated in the provided commit diff.
- The AddressSanitizer output provides the exact location in the code (`src/imagew-util.c:422:24`) where the out-of-bounds read occurs.
- The fix for this vulnerability is part of a larger commit that fixes similar invalid memory access bugs.
