The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9745.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the `_bfd_hexdump` function within the binutils library. This is caused by processing of malformed VMS Alpha binaries with an "overlarge command length parameter" in EITR records.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, triggered due to insufficient bounds checking when handling command length parameters within EITR records in VMS Alpha binaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash of the `objdump` tool when processing a crafted binary, and potentially other security issues due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a malformed VMS Alpha binary as input to the `objdump` tool, specifically when the `-D` option is used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted VMS Alpha binary to a system running the vulnerable version of `objdump`. The attacker would need to have access to the target system's filesystem, or be able to provide the crafted binary through other means, such as a webserver that is then accessed by a user on the vulnerable system via a URL.
