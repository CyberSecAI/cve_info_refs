{
  "CVE-2017-9765": {
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in gSOAP versions prior to 2.8.48. An attacker can send a specially crafted XML message larger than 2GB to an open unsecured server to trigger a crash. While the overflowing data is cleaned, the potential for code injection is reduced.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of large XML messages, specifically a stack buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing XML processing instructions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of proper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (server crash) or potentially remote code execution on vulnerable servers.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted large XML message via an exposed network service."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a large XML message (over 2GB) to a vulnerable gSOAP server."
