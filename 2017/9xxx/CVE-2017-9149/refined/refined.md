Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9149:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an `AttributeError` in the Nautilus extension of the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit (MAT). Specifically, the extension was trying to access a non-existent attribute `is_gone` of a file object. This was introduced in a previous commit that cleaned up the nautilus extension code. The use of `os.path.join` for concatenating parts of the basename of a file was also an issue which affected the `--backup` option.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The Nautilus extension was silently failing to clean metadata due to the `AttributeError` which was introduced in commit `0d1fe255`.
-  The `--backup` option was not working properly due to the use of `os.path.join` for concatenating parts of the basename of a file. This was introduced in commit `d054e313`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is that the MAT Nautilus extension fails to remove metadata, without informing the user. This means users may believe their files' metadata has been anonymized when it has not, potentially leading to unintentional disclosure of sensitive information. Specifically:
  - The "Clean metadata" context menu option in Nautilus fails silently, without creating backup files or modifying the original file, leading to user confusion.
  - Users are unaware that the metadata is not being removed.
  - This issue renders MAT useless for its intended purpose via the Nautilus extension.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using the "Clean metadata" context menu option in Nautilus on any file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't need any special capabilities. They would have to be a user who is using the MAT tool and its Nautilus integration and unaware of the bug.
