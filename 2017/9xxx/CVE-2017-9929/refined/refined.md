  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `get_fileinfo` function of lrzip.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by enticing a user to open a specially crafted archive file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted archive file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious file that triggers the overflow.",
     "more_details": "The vulnerability occurs when writing data to the `chunk_size` variable on the stack, overflowing its allocated buffer. Specifically, a write of size 10 at offset 424 on the stack exceeds the bounds of the 8-byte `chunk_size` variable, leading to the overflow."
