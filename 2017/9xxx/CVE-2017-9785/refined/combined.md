[`b826aaf`](/NancyFx/Nancy/commit/b826aaf6c00b51804c0de9542c1f7c13a3ef2604)

* Security Issue in JSON deserialization used by CSRF cookie handling. Removed use of JSON (de)serialization in Csrf.cs, to prevent a possible remote code execution vulnerability. Thanks to Alvaro Muñoz and Alexandr Mirosh from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Security for pointing out this flaw. Affected versions are all Nancy `1.x` releases and all pre-release candidates of `2.x` up to and including `2.0-clinteastwood`. The new CRSF cookie will not be backwards compatible with cookies that was generated with earlier versions.
* All `1.x` users are advised to upgrade to `1.4.4`
* All `2.x` users are advised to use a build from our MyGet feed until `2.0-dangermouse` has been published to NuGet

ℹ️ Be advised that you have had to *explicitly* enable CSRF support, by calling `CSRF.Enable(...)`, to be affected by this vulnerability.
