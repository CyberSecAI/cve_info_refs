Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-9264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer over-read in the Open vSwitch (OvS) firewall implementation. Specifically, the functions `extract_l3_ipv6`, `extract_l4_tcp`, and `extract_l4_udp` within `lib/conntrack.c` are affected. These functions lack proper checks on the sizes of TCP, UDP, and IPv6 headers, allowing for a read beyond the buffer when parsing malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Over-read:** The primary weakness is the ability to read beyond the allocated buffer due to insufficient size validation of the TCP, UDP, and IPv6 headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted TCP, UDP, or IPv6 packet, potentially causing a denial of service. The over-read could lead to a crash or other instability in the system running Open vSwitch.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted network packet.
- **Network Packet:** The attack vector involves sending a malformed TCP, UDP, or IPv6 packet to a system running vulnerable version of Open vSwitch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target system.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is triggered during packet parsing, and therefore no prior authentication is required to exploit it.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the capability to craft specific network packets with malformed TCP, UDP, or IPv6 headers.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `lib/conntrack.c` of the Open vSwitch codebase.
- The issue was addressed in Open vSwitch version 2.7.2-1
- Patches were released in multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs), including RHSA-2017:2418, RHSA-2017:2648, and RHSA-2017:2727.
- The vulnerability was reported by Bhargava Shastry.
- A patch was created by Ben Pfaff that includes the necessary checks for header sizes.
