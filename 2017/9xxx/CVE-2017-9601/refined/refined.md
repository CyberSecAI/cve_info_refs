The provided content discusses a vulnerability affecting 44 iOS credit union applications, where login credentials could be exposed. The specific CVE-2017-9601 is associated with the "FNB Kemp Mobile Banking" application in the list.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the code used for validating TLS certificates, potentially originating from third-party code within the applications. This implies the apps are not properly validating the authenticity of the server they are communicating with.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper TLS certificate validation allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. The apps fail to verify the legitimacy of the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the server, making them susceptible to attacks where an attacker can impersonate the legitimate server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to silently intercept a user's banking username and password when they log into the affected application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is conducted via a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. An attacker within the local network range of the user can intercept communications between the app and the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within wireless range (50-100 feet) of the victim. The attacker also needs to be able to perform a MitM attack, such as by using a tool like bettercap with HTTPS sniffing enabled and the POST request parser.
