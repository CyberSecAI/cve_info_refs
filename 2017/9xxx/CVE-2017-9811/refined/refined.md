{
  "CVE-2017-9811": {
    "Root cause": "Improper privilege management, specifically excessive permissions granted to the 'kluser' account.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The 'kluser' account is able to interact with the 'kav4fs-control' binary which allows for privilege escalation.",
      "Abuse of quarantine read and write operations within the 'kav4fs-control' binary."
    ],
    "Impact": "Privilege escalation from 'kluser' to root, leading to potential command execution with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by abusing the quarantine functionality via the 'kav4fs-control' binary.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to the system as the 'kluser' user. No remote network access is needed for this specific vulnerability."
  }
