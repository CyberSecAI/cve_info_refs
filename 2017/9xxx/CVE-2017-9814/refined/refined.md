Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9814:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how cairo's `cairo-truetype-subset.c` handles memory allocation for the `cmap` table in TrueType fonts. Specifically, a `malloc(0)` call can occur in some scenarios due to the `size` variable being 0.  `malloc(0)` doesn't return `NULL` as some might expect but a small chunk of memory.
- The code does not check for this condition and proceeds to use the allocated memory which is not properly initialized, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the allocated pointer is later accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:**  The core issue is that the code reads from an invalid memory location, because the `map` pointer is not correctly initialized if malloc(0) returns.
- **Incorrect assumption about `malloc(0)`:** The code assumes `malloc(0)` will return NULL, which it doesn't.
- **Lack of input validation:**  The code fails to validate the size of the `cmap` table before allocating memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service, where the application crashes due to the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted TrueType fonts:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted TrueType font file.
- **Indirect trigger through libraries:** Vulnerable applications using cairo to render fonts (e.g., PDF viewers utilizing poppler and cairo via `pdftocairo`) may be indirectly exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide malicious input:** The attacker must be able to supply a malicious TrueType font to an application using cairo.
- **No special privileges required:** Exploitation can occur without requiring special privileges.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue was found by Offensive Research at Salesforce.com, and they created a proof-of-concept PDF to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Patches were created to address the issue by:
    - Checking the cmap size before allocating, preventing allocation of zero-sized buffers.
    - Replacing direct calls to `malloc()` with `_cairo_malloc()`, which handles the `malloc(0)` case gracefully.
- The vulnerability is present in cairo versions 1.15.6 and earlier.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description which simply states "cairo-truetype-subset.c in cairo 1.15.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) because of mishandling of an unexpected malloc(0) call."
