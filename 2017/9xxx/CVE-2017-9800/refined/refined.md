Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9800:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content confirms that the vulnerability described relates to CVE-2017-9800, specifically a command injection flaw in Subversion clients when handling maliciously constructed `svn+ssh://` URLs.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the improper handling of `svn+ssh://` URLs by Subversion clients. The client passes the provided URL, including malicious options, to the `ssh` command, resulting in the execution of arbitrary commands specified within the URL via the `-oProxyCommand` option.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The `svn+ssh://` URL, when processed, can introduce shell commands into the `ssh` client's execution context.
    - **Lack of Input Validation:**  The Subversion client lacks sufficient input validation on the host part of the URL before passing it to the ssh command.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running the Subversion client. This can lead to:
      - System compromise.
      - Data theft or manipulation.
      - Further malicious activities on the compromised system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious Repository:** An attacker can host a malicious repository containing specially crafted `svn+ssh://` URLs, usually through svn:externals properties.
   - **Malicious Commit:**  A compromised or malicious user can commit malicious `svn+ssh://` URLs within a repository.
   - **Proxy Server:** A malicious proxy server could also inject these malicious URLs during a connection.
   - **svnsync:** The `svnsync sync` command is also vulnerable when using a malicious URL as a source.
   - **SourceTree URI Handler**: When SourceTree is used as a git client, it can also be triggered via a malicious URL handler in a webpage.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote:** The attacker can be remote.
   - **Low User Privileges:** The attacker does not need high privileges on the client system.
   - **Entice User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to interact with the malicious repository/URL (e.g., check out, update, or `svnsync`).

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

- Subversion clients connect to URLs provided by the repository in cases such as 'checkout', 'export', 'update', 'switch' (when `svn:externals` are present), and `svnsync sync`.
- A malicious `svn+ssh://` URL will cause Subversion clients to run an arbitrary shell command. The `ssh` command receives the host information of the URL, which, if crafted maliciously, can be used for command execution with the option `-oProxyCommand` (or `-proxycmd` for PuTTY).
- The vulnerability affects all Subversion clients, including those using `file://`, `http://`, and plain (untunneled) `svn://`.
- The vulnerability is also present in several git clients like SourceTree.
- Fixes involve upgrading Subversion clients or configuring the ssh client not to evaluate shell commands from the host value.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Joern Schneeweisz of Recurity Labs.
- It is important to note that the severity of this vulnerability is considered critical.
