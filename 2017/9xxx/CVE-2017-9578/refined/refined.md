The provided content discusses a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS applications, including the "RVCB Mobile" app, which is listed as CVE-2017-9578.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This code may be derived from third-party libraries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept communications between the app and the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can silently intercept usernames and passwords of users logging into the affected applications. This could lead to unauthorized access to users' banking accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be performed wirelessly by an attacker within close range of the victim (approximately 50-100 feet).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the user.
- The attacker needs the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which can be achieved using tools like `bettercap`. They also need to enable HTTPS sniffing and use the "POST" request parser.
