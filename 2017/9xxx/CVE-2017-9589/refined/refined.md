The provided content describes a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS applications, including "SCSB Shelbyville IL Mobile Banking" (CVE-2017-9589), and is relevant to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates. It's potentially derived from third-party code used within the applications. The specific details of the flawed code will be published at a later date.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker within range (approximately 50-100 feet) to silently intercept banking usernames and passwords while a user logs into the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack via a wireless network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which can be done using tools like bettercap to intercept and analyze network traffic including the traffic that the app sends to the banking server, which contains credentials.
- No modifications to the mobile device are needed as the weakness is present in the app.
