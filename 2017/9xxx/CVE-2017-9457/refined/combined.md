# coreboot for CompuLab Intense PC

[4 Replies](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/12/coreboot-compulab-intense-pc-mintbox/#comments)

I am very pleased to announce that coreboot now supports the CompuLab Intense PC and MintBox 2! ??

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mintbox-coreboot-1.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mintbox-coreboot-1.jpg)

**Building coreboot**

The instructions for building coreboot yourself can be found on the [coreboot Wiki](https://www.coreboot.org/Build_HOWTO). You will need a Linux system with typical development packages installed such as *build-essential*.

Select CompuLab and Intense-PC in the *Mainboard* section of the coreboot menuconfig:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menuconfig_mainboard.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menuconfig_mainboard.png)

You need to decide at this point whether you wish to use the internal full-height PCI-Express slot for mSATA or as PCI-Express:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PCB_mSATA_PCIe.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PCB_mSATA_PCIe.jpg)

If you have not installed an additional mSATA SSD in your Intense PC, then you do not need to select this option. Selecting the mSATA option is only required if you have installed an mSATA SSD and want to use it in the Intense PC:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mSATA_SSD.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mSATA_SSD.jpg)

Because coreboot does not have full support for the embedded controller (EC) in the Intense PC right now, the choice of using mSATA or PCIe **cannot be made at runtime**. If later you wish to change the function of the slot, you need to rebuild coreboot while selecting the appropriate choice of mSATA or PCIe.

Note that the mSATA port is limited to SATA 3Gbps speeds. This is a hardware limitation of the Intense PC design, and cannot be changed by flashing coreboot.

---

It is important to include the Firmware Descriptor Table (FDT), ME, and GbE regions of flash. Specify these files in the *Chipset* section:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menuconfig_chipset.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menuconfig_chipset.png)

You can choose yourself if you want to run me\_cleaner on the ME or not. Note that if you choose to run me\_cleaner, **all SATA ports will cease to function**. This is not a coreboot specific bug, the same behaviour occurs on the CompuLab firmware when me\_cleaner is run. It may or may not be possible to fix this issue, more research is needed to understand the root cause.

---

If you want to have video during POST, you also need to include the Intel VGA BIOS in the image. Specify this in the *Devices* section:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menuconfig_devices.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menuconfig_devices.png)

In theory coreboot graphics init is supposed to initialize the Intel HD graphics without the need for the VGA BIOS, however without the VGA BIOS I was unable to get any video output until the Linux kernel started booting. This makes using the bootloader menu or troubleshooting pre-boot issues very difficult.

---

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/menuconfig_console-1.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/menuconfig_console-1.png)

I would recommend you enable logging to cbmem at a minimum. This will allow you to access the coreboot boot log in Linux using the *cbmem* utility. If you have trouble booting the Intense PC after flashing coreboot, I would recommend you enable logging to UART, and use the included serial dongle to debug coreboot via RS-232 (115200n8). UART support for the Intense PC should be accepted to coreboot master shortly.

---

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/menuconfig_payload.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/menuconfig_payload.png)

The default boot order of SeaBIOS seems to be SATA HDD if present, then PXE boot (if compiled with iPXE). It is possible and easy to change this, by specifying a bootorder file to include in cbfs when building coreboot.

I have created a boot order file which searches for boot devices in the following order:

1. USB 2.0 devices
2. USB 3.0 devices
3. SATA devices (in order: 2.5″ internal, mSATA, eSATA, FACE module)
4. iPXE

You can download the [bootorder file](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bootorder.txt) and include it in cbfs. If you don’t include iPXE as a payload, remove the last line of the bootorder.txt file. If you are not building SeaBIOS as a payload, then you do not require this file.

---

After building coreboot, but before flashing, we need to split the coreboot.rom file into two 8MB files. This is because the Intense PC has two 8MB NOR flash chips totaling 16MB.

Split the coreboot.rom file into two 8MB files “SC1.bin” and “SC2.bin” using dd:

`$ dd if=build/coreboot.rom of=SC1.bin bs=1M count=8

$ dd if=build/coreboot.rom of=SC2.bin bs=1M skip=8`

---

**Extracting binary firmware components**

You may notice above that several portions of the initial Intense PC firmware are required to successfully build coreboot. The Intel Descriptor file (otherwise known as the Flash Descriptor Table or *FDT*), Management Engine firmware, Gigabit Ethernet region, and VGA BIOS.

If you have **not** yet installed the CompuLab firmware update to address [CVE-2017-8083](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/), you should be able to dump the entire firmware using flashrom in Linux:

`# flashrom -p internal:laptop=force_I_want_a_brick -r intense_pc.bin`

If you have already patched your system, then flashrom will be unable to dump the firmware:

`Enabling flash write... Warning: SPI Configuration Lockdown activated.

FREG0: Warning: Flash Descriptor region (0x00000000-0x00000fff) is read-only.

FREG2: Warning: Management Engine region (0x00003000-0x00cfffff) is locked.`

You will have to use a hardware method to dump the firmware from the chips. As an example, using a ch341 based SPI programmer and flashrom:

`# flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r sc1.bin

# flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r sc2.bin`

Confirm that sc1.bin contains the start of the flash descriptor:

`$ hexdump -C sc1.bin | head -2

00000000 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff |................|

00000010 5a a5 f0 0f 03 01 04 03 06 02 10 12 20 01 21 00 |Z........... .!.|`

Do not forget to concatenate the firmware together into a 16MB image before running ifdtool:

`$ cat sc1.bin sc2.bin > intense_pc.bin`

You can then extract the regions from the firmware using *ifdtool* (included in coreboot/utils):

`$ ifdutil -x intense_pc.bin`

The output of ifdtool should appear as follows:

`File intense_pc.bin is 16777216 bytes

Flash Region 0 (Flash Descriptor): 00000000 - 00000fff

Flash Region 1 (BIOS): 00d00000 - 00ffffff

Flash Region 2 (Intel ME): 00003000 - 00cfffff

Flash Region 3 (GbE): 00001000 - 00002fff

Flash Region 4 (Platform Data): 00fff000 - 00000fff (unused)`

*ifdtool* will output files for each flash region. For building coreboot, we are interested in the following regions:

`flashregion_0_flashdescriptor.bin

flashregion_2_intel_me.bin

flashregion_3_gbe.bin`

---

If ifdtool doesn’t work for some reason, verify that you have concatenated the firmware files in the correct order. Or, if you don’t want to use ifdtool, you can split it manually using dd.

Intel Descriptor file/FDT:

`$ dd if=intense_pc.bin of=descriptor.bin bs=4096 count=1`

Management Engine:

`$ dd if=intense_pc.bin of=me.bin bs=4096 count=1028 skip=3`

Gigabit Ethernet region:

`$ dd if=intense_pc.bin of=gbe.bin bs=4096 count=2 skip=1`

---

You can extract the VGA BIOS from within Linux. First, verify the PCI ID of the Intel integrated graphics controller. On the Intense PC, this should be 00:02.0:

`$ lspci | grep Graphics

00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller [8086:0166] (rev 09)`

Once you have confirmed the PCI ID, you can dump the VGA BIOS to a file:

`# echo 1 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/rom

# cat /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/rom > vgabios.bin

# echo 0 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/rom`

*vgabios.bin* should be exactly 65536 bytes and begin similar to the following:

`$ hexdump -C vgabios.bin | head -2

00000000 55 aa 78 e9 b8 e9 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 |U.x...0000000000|

00000010 30 30 90 24 e9 a9 23 a0 40 00 b0 0a 30 30 49 42 |00.$..#[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)|`

It is recommended to also dump the video bios table (VBT) to a file to include in cbfs, as the VBT table is expected by Windows:

`# cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_vbt > vbt.bin`

vbt.bin should be exactly 6144 bytes and look similar to the following:

`$ hexdump -C vbt.bin | head -2

00000000 24 56 42 54 20 53 4e 42 2f 49 56 42 2d 4d 4f 42 |$VBT SNB/IVB-MOB|

00000010 49 4c 45 20 64 00 30 00 b8 10 e7 00 30 00 00 00 |ILE d.0.....0...|`

**Flashing coreboot**

The following instructions are provided AS-IS and with no warranty, express or implied. Flashing coreboot can turn your computer into a brick and **will void your warranty**. By following these instructions you acknowledge these risks and assume all liability.

To flash coreboot onto your Intense PC, you will need an SPI programmer supported by flashrom.

An inexpensive option is a CH341 based SPI programmer (<$2 USD from eBay/AliExpress):

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ch341a_spi.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ch341a_spi.jpg)

Another useful tool which can [also be used for flashing](https://www.flashrom.org/Bus_Pirate) is the [Bus Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate) (~$25 USD):

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/buspirate.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/buspirate.jpg)

[The Raspberry Pi should also work](https://www.flashrom.org/RaspberryPi). [Here is a detailed post](https://tomvanveen.eu/flashing-bios-chip-raspberry-pi/) on how to use the Raspberry Pi to flash firmware to a NOR flash.

Unfortunately for us, the NOR flash in the Intense PC is in a WSON package ([very very thin small outline no lead package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integrated_circuit_packaging_types#Small_outline_packages)) so a SOIC clip or SOIC socket will not work.

Because the Intense PC uses the chassis as a heat sink, you need to remove the motherboard from the Intense PC chassis to access the NOR flash. To do this, first remove the hard drive and hard drive carrier secured by a single screw:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intense_PC_bottom_HDD_carrier_screw.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intense_PC_bottom_HDD_carrier_screw.jpg)

Next, remove the 4 screws securing the bottom plate to the chassis:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intense_PC_HDD_carrier_screws.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intense_PC_HDD_carrier_screws.jpg)

Next, remove the retaining screw of the FACE module:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intense_PC_FACE_screw.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intense_PC_FACE_screw.jpg)

Next, remove the screw and two stand-offs securing the motherboard to the chassis. The screw is by the Ethernet ports, and the two stand-offs: one near the audio ports and one under the FACE module:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intense_PC_PCB_screws.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Intense_PC_PCB_screws.jpg)

Disconnect the WiFi antennas (if installed) and disconnect the front panel connector near the SODIMM sockets. You should now be able to lift the motherboard out of the chassis.

You will find the two NOR flash modules on the reverse side of the motherboard:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PCB_SC1_SC2.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PCB_SC1_SC2.jpg)

You will need to solder connections to the pads beside each chip to back up the original firmware and to flash coreboot.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SC1_SC2_pinout-1.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/SC1_SC2_pinout-1.jpg)

If you’re using the ch341 based programmer, then the flashrom commands would be the following:

For the NOR flash near SC1: `$ sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w SC1.bin`

For the NOR flash near SC2: `$ sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w SC2.bin`

---

**Conclusion**

If you value open-source software and want an alternative to the closed-source and infrequently updated CompuLab firmware, then coreboot is a great choice for the Intense PC/MintBox 2.

However building and flashing coreboot on the Intense PC is not without its risks. You **will void your warranty** and specialized equipment such as a soldering iron and SPI flashing tool are required.

I was disappointed to find [multiple](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/07/cve-2017-9457-compulab-intense-pc-lacks-firmware-validation/) [vulnerabilities](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/) in CompuLab’s Intense PC firmware. These serious vulnerabilities and CompuLab’s rather lackluster response inspired me to port coreboot to the Intense PC.

I am not an expert on the inner workings of the x86 platform and boot process, so I could not have successfully completed this port without the assistance of the excellent [autoport tool](https://github.com/MattDevo/coreboot/tree/master/util/autoport).

**Coreboot advantages**

* ?Open-source firmware?
* Better memory (RAM) compatibility than the CompuLab firmware
* Memtest86+ and iPXE can be included as a payload in flash
* Verified boot supported via vboot

**Limitations**

* VBIOS is required if you want any video output before the kernel framebuffer is initialized
* VGA hand-off to Windows is still not working
* ME firmware is still necessary for most users as [me\_cleaner breaks SATA](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/issues/119)
* Currently no easy path to support UEFI
* No FACE modules except for the included 4 port USB2.0 FACE module (FM-4USB) are supported (due to lack of additional FACE modules to test)

---

*Please note that due to copyright concerns I cannot distribute binary firmware components such as the ME firmware or video BIOS. Additionally, for technical reasons I cannot provide a fully built, flashable coreboot image for your Intense PC. This is the reason for the “Extracting binary firmware components” section of the article.*

If you experience issues building or using coreboot, please leave a comment or subscribe to the [coreboot mailing list](https://mail.coreboot.org/mailman/listinfo/coreboot) and ask your question there.

The coreboot project and I make no guarantee these instructions and the resulting firmware won’t turn your system into a fancy brick. The instructions produce a bootable firmware on my hardware (MintBox 2) at the time of writing, although this could change at some point in the future.

Please exercise caution and common sense when modifying system firmware and ensure you always have a backup of the original firmware on another device should something go wrong.

      A cursory check of [Intel Ark](https://ark.intel.com/products/59505/Intel-Desktop-Board-DH77EB) proves this claim is incorrect. The DH77EB is a microATX board, while the Intense PC uses a much smaller proprietary form factor. Additionally, the DH77EB uses the H77 chipset while the Intense PC uses the HM76 chipset.

      The post from Purism is largely focused on ME11, which is based on an x86 core running MINIX. The ME on the Intense PC is of an older generation based on the ARC core, which has had comparatively less investigation due to the obscure instruction set of ARC.

   As of coreboot 4.12 libgfxinit seems to be working properly with TianoCore (CorebootPayload). It is no longer necessary to include the VGA BIOS to have video output from coreboot.

# [Meraki MG21 hardware overview and secure boot bypass](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/09/meraki-mg21-hardware-overview-and-secure-boot-bypass/)

[Leave a reply](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/09/meraki-mg21-hardware-overview-and-secure-boot-bypass/#respond)

The Meraki MG21, introduced in 2019, is a Cat 6 LTE gateway intended for fail-over connectivity. It features a soldered modem module and either two internal (MG21) or two external (MG21E) antennas.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-HW.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-HW.jpg)

Meraki MG21 LTE gateway

Here is a summary of the MG21 specs:

* Qualcomm [IPQ4029](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/networking/wi-fi-networks/ipq4029) (ARM A7, 4 cores @ ~700MHz)
* 512MB DDR3 RAM (soldered)
* 128MB of NAND flash ([Winbond W29N01HV](https://web.archive.org/web/20240827113306/https%3A//www.winbond.com/hq/product/code-storage-flash-memory/slc-nand-flash/?__locale=en&partNo=W29N01HV))
* Cinterion PLAS9-X LTE Cat 6 modem module (LCC, soldered)
* Gigabit Ethernet (x2, QCA8072 PHY)
* Nano-SIM slot

---

There are no screws holding the MG21 together, the case is glued. As Meraki used glue and not adhesive to hold the MG21 together, heat does not help in opening the device. To open the MG21/MG21E: guitar picks and Isopropyl alcohol are recommended, with a lot of patience.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-disassembly.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-disassembly.jpg)

Opening the MG21 with guitar picks and Isopropyl alcohol

The 3.3V UART header in the MG21 is J5, which is unpopulated, and follows the standard Meraki pinout (1: VCC, 2: Tx, 3: Rx, 4: GND) with a 115200 baud rate. It looks like Meraki may have planned to ship the MG21 with an integrated u-blox module (U22), however on my production units the module is absent.

With the summary aside, let us focus on the secure boot status of the device. For context, see [Breaking secure boot on the Meraki Z3 and Meraki Go GX20](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/04/breaking-secure-boot-on-the-meraki-z3-and-meraki-go-gx20/).

```

```

*Foreshadowing*: You will notice that this output is very similar to that of the Z3 and GX20.

Unfortunately changing the EEPROM value to the MR33 (stinkbug) does not work, because Meraki have removed support for the legacy non-secure boot devices from recent U-Boot builds:

```

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-U21-NAND.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-U21-NAND.jpg)

Removing the BGA NAND and replacing the `u-boot` region with a dump of the Z3 2018 U-Boot build, U-Boot is still performing signature validation:

```

U-Boot 2017.07-RELEASE-g39cabb9bf3 (May 24 2018 - 14:07:32 -0700)

DRAM:  242 MiB
machid : 0x8010001
NAND:  ONFI device found
128 MiB
Using default environment

(...)

Secure boot enabled.

```

The reason for this is that the EEPROM is not found. But why? We have a clue from the stock bootlog of the device:

```

[   15.287320] i2c /dev entries driver
[   15.302889] at24 0-0056: 8192 byte 24c64 EEPROM, writable, 32 bytes/write

```

The EEPROM in the MG21 has the address `0x56` instead of `0x50` as on the Z3. This causes the downgraded Z3 U-Boot build to not detect the EEPROM.

The Meraki Go GR10 (Maggot) [also has the EEPROM at address `0x56`](https://github.com/halmartin/u-boot-z3/blob/main/U-boot.Z3/board/qca/arm/ipq40xx/meraki_config.c#L57-L62):

```

struct eeprom_i2c_config
{
	uint16_t gpio_scl;
	uint16_t gpio_scl_func;
	uint16_t gpio_sda;
	uint16_t gpio_sda_func;
	uint16_t eeprom_addr;
};
/* valid eeprom configuration for insects */
static const struct eeprom_i2c_config valid_eeprom_i2c_config[] = {
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x50 }, // Stinkbug, Ladybug, Noisy Cricket
    { 10, 4, 11, 4, 0x56 }, // Maggot
};

```

However, the GR10 uses different GPIO pins to access the EEPROM.

I do not have the U-Boot source code of the MG21 to review (see endnote). Lacking the U-Boot source code, we can `hexdump` the Z3 and MG21 U-Boot regions from the flash dumps and compare.

Z3:

```

00044360  0f 00 14 00 01 00 15 00  01 00 50 00 0a 00 04 00  |..........P.....|
00044370  0b 00 04 00 56 00 00 00  00 f0 f4 a1 ea ea fb 01  |....V...........|

```

MG21:

```

000452f0  0f 00 14 00 01 00 15 00  01 00 50 00 14 00 01 00  |..........P.....|
00045300  15 00 01 00 56 00 00 00  00 f0 f4 a1 ea ea fb 01  |....V...........|

```

Decoding the structs from the `hexdump` we can infer the C source code used in the MG21 U-Boot build:

```

static const struct eeprom_i2c_config valid_eeprom_i2c_config[] = {
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x50 }, // Fuzzy Cricket, Fairyfly, Heart of Gold
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x56 }, // Tie Fighter
};

```

The only difference between the MG21 and Z3 is in the EEPROM address, the GPIO configuration remains the same.

Reviewing the datasheet of the at24 EEPROM, we can see that the address is set by the first 3 pins (A0-A2) being pulled to ground or Vcc. Since the EEPROM has the address 0x56, that must correspond to the bitmask 110 or: A0: 0, A1: Vcc, A2: Vcc.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/at24c64-MG21.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/at24c64-MG21.png)

After some verification on the PCB, removing the surface mount resistor R50 (4.7k) above U6 will remove Vcc from A1 and A2, changing the EEPROM address from `0x56` to `0x50`.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-U6-EEPROM.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-U6-EEPROM.jpg)

The signed Z3 2018 U-Boot build now properly detects the EEPROM at address `0x50` and disables signature validation on the payload.

The chain-loaded U-Boot I used as a proof-of-concept is based on the [Z3 GPL source code provided by Meraki in 2021](https://github.com/halmartin/u-boot-z3), which does not include support for the MG21. Networking is non-functional, which makes further development challenging as images must be (slowly) transferred via UART.

---

Some readers may be wondering about the MG41. This secure boot bypass does not work on the MG41.

Meraki has signed the MG41 bootloader with a unique device certificate (`x-wing`), so cross-flashing U-Boot from another device such as the Z3 will not work.

Although the FCC internal photos of the MG41 show both NAND and EMMC, the production MG41 has only EMMC present. The `boot_meraki_qca` function has been re-written as `boot_meraki_mmc_qca`. During this re-write, Meraki removed the vulnerable `switch` statement that aborts enforcing signature validation on legacy products.

---

tl;dr

1. MG21 uses the same device signing certificate as the Z3 and GX20
2. Overwrite `u-boot` on NAND with dump from Z3 running 2018 release
3. Change Product ID in EEPROM to device without secure boot (MR33)
4. Desolder R50 to change EEPROM address

The MG41 is not vulnerable to this technique.

| MG41 | X-Wing | 600-119020 |
| MG41E | X-Wing | (unknown, let me know in comments) |

There is still a long road ahead to support the MG21 with any custom firmware such as OpenWrt. Downgrading U-Boot on the device is not easy due to the weather proofing of the device, and the use of BGA NAND.

The GPL source code for the MG21 and MG41 was [requested from Meraki](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7a150a1f145709150f08191f3a171f081b11135419151745090f18101f190e473d2a365a29150f08191f5a39151e1f5a281f0b0f1f090e) in April 2024. At the time of writing Meraki has not provided any of the requested source code.

Meraki [announced the end of sale of the MG21 and MG41 in March 2024](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Meraki_End-of-Life_%28EOL%29_Products_and_Dates), and stopped selling the MG21 and MG41 on 2024-09-18.

Meraki tries to be the Apple of SMB networking, and frequently uses premium materials like aluminum in their product designs (MS220, MS320, [MS225](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2022/10/meraki-ms210-ms225-hardware-overview/), [MS350](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2023/12/meraki-ms350-hardware-overview/), [MX84](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2023/02/meraki-mx84-overview/)). This is a bit silly for something that sits in a rack, but it is the brand image they were trying to cultivate.

The MX85 does not appear to use any aluminum in the chassis. Like the budget-oriented MS120 series, the entire MX85 chassis is made of steel. Meraki marketing will tell you this was for better cooling and is definitely not related to any cost reduction.

Meraki engineers even included thermal pads and metal spacers on top of the SFP ports (and below the PCB) to dissipate heat through the chassis. You could be forgiven for assuming they are SFP+ ports (they are not) with so much attention given to heat dissipation.

All for a device which consumes less power at idle than the (also) passively-cooled MX84, and no longer includes a spinning hard drive.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-ledboard.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-ledboard.jpg)

Unlike previous products, Meraki use glue to secure the front panel ribbon cable

---

The UART header is J3 on the MX85 and follows the standard Meraki UART pinout (1: VCC, 2: Tx, 3: Rx, 4: GND) at 3.3V and 115200 baud.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-uart.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-uart.jpg)

**Note**: R6 and R7 are 0 ohm resistors which (dis)connect Tx and Rx lines of the SoC to the UART header. R6/R7 are **not populated by default**. You must populate them, or bridge the pads, for the UART header to function.

---

The U-Boot release on the MX85 is `2018.09julia-spl-boxwine` and, like all other recent Meraki products, it does not allow interrupting boot.

As we can see from the above `ECC off` output, the MX85 is using non-ECC RAM. This is a downgrade from the MX84 which did use ECC memory.

The MX85 also contains the Cisco TAM, implemented using a SmartFusion2 M2S010. The TAM is used for secure boot.

# [Meraki MS420 hardware overview](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/06/meraki-ms420-hardware-overview/)

[Leave a reply](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/06/meraki-ms420-hardware-overview/#respond)

The Meraki MS420 series switches (codename “Fatboy”) offer 24 or 48 ports of 10G SFP+, with a dedicated gigabit Ethernet port for remote management.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Meraki_MS420_PCB_wms.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Meraki_MS420_PCB_wms.jpg)

The MS420 series does not support dedicated stacking capabilities, although you can always connect multiple switches together via SFP+.

The MS420 was [discontinued in 2016](https://documentation.meraki.com/%40api/deki/files/17012/meraki_eol_ms420.pdf?revision=1), and is too old to support secure boot.

Here is a quick summary of the MS420 specs:

* Broadcom BCM56840 family “Trident+” ASIC ([Product Brief PDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20230502050050/https%3A//docs.broadcom.com/doc/12358267)). The BCM56846 is used for both 24 and 48 port models.
* [BCM84754](https://www.broadcom.com/products/ethernet-connectivity/phy-and-poe/optical/bcm84754) SFI-to-XFI PHY
* Freescale [P2020E](https://web.archive.org/web/20231003201441/https%3A//www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/power-architecture/qoriq-communication-processors/p-series/qoriq-p2020-and-p2010-dual-and-single-core-communications-processors%3AP2020) (PowerPC) dual-core management CPU @ 1GHz
* 128MB NAND (Hynix H27U1G8F2BTR-BC)
* 2048MB DDR3 ECC RAM (soldered)

Like the PowerPC-based Meraki MX60 and MX80, the MS420-series uses Kernel 3.4.113.

Similar to other Meraki Broadcom-based switches, the MS420 series implements the packet engine in userspace, using the `linux_kernel_bde` and `linux_user_bde` kernel modules to interface with the ASIC. In the Meraki firmware, the packet engine is a component of the userspace `click` daemon, which loads the `bcm_click` shared object during click router initialisation.

The UART header is `CONN4` on the MS420 and follows the standard Meraki UART pinout (1: VCC, 2: Tx, 3: Rx, 4: GND) at 115200 baud.

---

The u-boot release on the MS420 is `2013.10` and allows interrupting the autoboot with the magic string `xyzzy`, as found on other older Meraki products before they disabled the boot delay. Therefore, you can interrupt the boot process, although you have only a few seconds to do so:

```

Once you have gained access to the u-boot console it is possible to `tftpboot` your own payload.

The P2020E boots directly off NAND, without an intermediate “bootkernel” on SPI flash (as is the case on the MS220, [MS210/225](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2022/10/meraki-ms210-ms225-hardware-overview/), and [MS350](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2023/12/meraki-ms350-hardware-overview/)).

Booting is not as straightforward as just creating a FIT image. Similar to the [MX80](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2021/01/meraki-mx80-buildroot-firmware/), Meraki have created a custom image format which includes a header with additional data used to validate the integrity of the image.

The layout of the image header for the MS420 is as follows:

| Header field | Data type (value) |
| --- | --- |
| `SHA1_MAGIC` | uint32 (`0x8e73ed8a`) |
| `DATA_OFFSET` | int32 (`0x0000400`) |
| `DATA_LEN` | int32 |
| `SHA1SUM` | char[20] |

---

0001:03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation Device b846 (rev 02)

```

The switch contains a discrete I2C RTC ([NXP PCF8563](https://www.nxp.com/products/analog-and-mixed-signal/real-time-clocks/real-time-clock-calendar%3APCF8563)), however there is no battery present so the RTC does not retain the time across power cycles.

```

rtc-pcf8563 2-0051: low voltage detected, date/time is not reliable.
rtc-pcf8563 2-0051: setting system clock to 2010-03-21 03:00:00 UTC (1269140400)

```

The four 40mm system fans in the MS420 are controlled by an [onsemi ADT7473](https://www.onsemi.com/products/sensors/thermal-management/fan-controllers/adt7473) ([PDF datasheet](https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/adt7473-d.pdf)). It appears that only the internal temperature sensor of the ADT7473 is present (for anyone else wondering, digging into the kernel module reveals that `temp1` corresponds to `Remote 1 Temperature`, `temp2` to `Local Temperature`, and `temp3` to `Remote 2 Temperature`). The Meraki firmware does a respectable job of managing fan speed; after booting and settling, the fans are not quite the 1U screamer as you might expect from such a switch. They are still audible, but it is tolerable and being near the switch does not require an investment in hearing protection.

The MS420 fans have a Meraki part number: `FAN-MS420-R` (P/N `680-29010`). These are identical to the Cisco `FAN-T1`, which can be purchased for *considerably* less than the Meraki branded part.

The MS420 accepts two hot-swap power supplies (model `PWR-MS420-400AC-R`, P/N `640-29010`), which in my units are Compuware model `CPR-4011-4M1` with 12V/33A and 5Vsb/3A output (combined power 400W) and are 80+ Gold certified:

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CPR-4011-4M1.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CPR-4011-4M1.jpg)

MS420-24 idle power consumption: ~85W (single PSU)

MS420-48 idle power consumption: ~100W (single PSU)

---

The GPL source code for the MS420 was requested from Meraki in July 2023 and at the time of writing Meraki has not provided any of the requested source code.

There are other Trident+ switches (like the [Arista DCS-7050S](https://isp-tech.ru/en/switch-asic/arista-7050s/)) that can be purchased for around $200 USD, and do not require any additional effort to use. Unless you have decommissioned MS420 switches, I would recommend against buying one as there are better options available.

# CVE-2017-9457: CompuLab Intense PC lacks firmware signature validation

[5 Replies](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/07/cve-2017-9457-compulab-intense-pc-lacks-firmware-validation/#comments)

**Summary**

CompuLab have not enabled signature checking of firmware updates for the Intense PC product line. This allows anyone in possession of the Phoenix UEFI update program to write a modified UEFI firmware to system flash. DOS/Windows versions of the Phoenix utility are easily obtained online, allowing a local or remote attacker to install a persistent firmware level rootkit to the computer, or to corrupt the system firmware, causing a denial of service.

Installation of a modified firmware can occur entirely in the background, without any user interaction, and once performed is virtually impossible to difficult to detect using operating system utilities. Physical access is not required.

**Product description**

The CompuLab Intense PC is fanless mini-PC. A model pre-installed with Linux Mint is also marketed under the name *MintBox 2*. The system firmware is the same for the Intense PC and MintBox 2. CompuLab also sell the Intense PC with an extended temperature range for industrial applications.

The product was introduced in [mid-2013](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ready-to-run-desktop-linux-pc-mintbox-2/) and is still being sold through Amazon US, Amazon Canada, Amazon Germany, Amazon Spain, and directly from CompuLab.

**Affected products**

* Intense PC (Intense PC Value, Intense PC Business, Intense PC Pro)
* MintBox 2

**Impact**

Any software running with local administrator privileges has unrestricted access to read and write the system’s firmware.

An attacker can modify the contents of the system firmware to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit, or to corrupt the firmware causing the computer to cease functioning.

The attack only requires local administrator privileges, and can be executed either by using an existing OS-level exploit to gain local administrator, or via tricking the user into running an executable (e.g. via an attachment in a phishing email).

**Proof of Concept**

The proof of concept provided for CVE-2017-8083 can be leveraged for this vulnerability as well. The proof of concept uses the Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility to write a modified firmware to flash. Please [refer to the article about CVE-2017-8083](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/) for a detailed description of the proof of concept.

The latest CompuLab firmware for the Intense PC (20170521) modified with the upstream EDKII shell can be downloaded [here](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-IPC-20170521-edk2.zip).

**Mitigation**

At this time there is no means for the end user to enable Capsule Signature verification or to prevent the Phoenix update utility from updating the system firmware.

Therefore Intense PC owners should consider the following options:

* Ensure your operating system is up to date with the latest security patches. Do not run software from untrusted sources.
* Do not connect your Intense PC to any networks with internet access (i.e. air-gap the computer).
* Discontinue your use of the Intense PC and *consider replacing the computer with one from a different manufacturer who implements signature validation for firmware updates*.

Should CompuLab decide to improve the security of the Intense PC firmware by enabling Capsule Signature validation, then the above recommendations would no longer apply. However, in my communication with CompuLab regarding this issue no indication was given that they have any plans to enable Capsule Signature verification in a future update. Therefore, it seems very unlikely to me CompuLab will issue an update which enables Capsule Signature verification.

**Disclosure timeline**:

*6 June 2017:* Issue reported to CompuLab

*6 June 2017:* CompuLab confirms that “Default settings of this source tree [Phoenix SecureCore Tiano Enhanced Intel Ivy Bridge CPU Panther Point M] has disabled Capsule Signature option.”

*6 June 2017:* Issue is reported to MITRE

*6 June 2017:* Vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-9457

*7 June 2017:* CompuLab are informed that the vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2017-9457 and details of the vulnerability will be published after 45 days

   I do disagree with the idea that firmware signature validation should be mandatory (which you seem to promote), as it usually makes it impossible for free software projects like Coreboot to make compatible ports. The benefits with Coreboot are that we can get a better idea of what is running on the computer (therefore more secure) and faster boot times. Some vendor BIOSes restricts what wifi cards can be used and that is not in the user’s interest, too.

   I think it would be better with firmware signature validation that can be turned off by the user (of course in the BIOS, not from OS level).

      > I think it would be better with firmware signature validation that can be turned off by the user (of course in the BIOS, not from OS level).

      I didn’t mean to imply that the only way forward was to strictly enforce firmware signature validation. So I agree with you that the option to enforce signed firmware updates should be a requirement for anyone designing a computer.

      In the old days of BIOS, there was a write-protect jumper you could select to prevent BIOS updates. With UEFI, such a jumper is not possible anymore as flash is partitioned between ROM and EEPROM components (e.g. saving UEFI boot entries) and a write-protect jumper on the hardware part would prevent fundamental parts of UEFI from correctly functioning. Therefore write-protection must be implemented at a software level.

      The fact that a firmware signature validation option is missing completely is a huge security oversight by CompuLab and leaves their users open to malicious software installing rogue firmware updates or bricking the device. Sadly they have not shown any interest in including a firmware signature validation option.

      > The benefits with Coreboot are that we can get a better idea of what is running on the computer (therefore more secure)

      This isn’t necessarily true. Most complaints about x86 platform security stem from the [Intel Management Engine (IME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology) which Coreboot can’t disable on newer platforms (such as this one). Additionally, at a firmware level a lot of code is very specific to the exact hardware in question, and may rely on proprietary/NDA-level information (e.g. IOMMU) to achieve the same functionality as proprietary code it aims to replace.

      Having a FLOSS firmware will not necessarily lead to more people being able to improve it or fix bugs. I think this is well illustrated in the extremely small number of targets Coreboot supports.

   Gustaf, you may be pleased to hear that [I have ported coreboot to this hardware](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/12/coreboot-compulab-intense-pc-mintbox/), so the vendor’s lack of signature verification/enforcement is no longer a concern 🙂

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

# CVE-2017-9457: CompuLab Intense PC lacks firmware signature validation

[5 Replies](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/07/cve-2017-9457-compulab-intense-pc-lacks-firmware-validation/#comments)

**Summary**

CompuLab have not enabled signature checking of firmware updates for the Intense PC product line. This allows anyone in possession of the Phoenix UEFI update program to write a modified UEFI firmware to system flash. DOS/Windows versions of the Phoenix utility are easily obtained online, allowing a local or remote attacker to install a persistent firmware level rootkit to the computer, or to corrupt the system firmware, causing a denial of service.

Installation of a modified firmware can occur entirely in the background, without any user interaction, and once performed is virtually impossible to difficult to detect using operating system utilities. Physical access is not required.

**Product description**

The CompuLab Intense PC is fanless mini-PC. A model pre-installed with Linux Mint is also marketed under the name *MintBox 2*. The system firmware is the same for the Intense PC and MintBox 2. CompuLab also sell the Intense PC with an extended temperature range for industrial applications.

The product was introduced in [mid-2013](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ready-to-run-desktop-linux-pc-mintbox-2/) and is still being sold through Amazon US, Amazon Canada, Amazon Germany, Amazon Spain, and directly from CompuLab.

**Affected products**

* Intense PC (Intense PC Value, Intense PC Business, Intense PC Pro)
* MintBox 2

**Impact**

Any software running with local administrator privileges has unrestricted access to read and write the system’s firmware.

An attacker can modify the contents of the system firmware to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit, or to corrupt the firmware causing the computer to cease functioning.

The attack only requires local administrator privileges, and can be executed either by using an existing OS-level exploit to gain local administrator, or via tricking the user into running an executable (e.g. via an attachment in a phishing email).

**Proof of Concept**

The proof of concept provided for CVE-2017-8083 can be leveraged for this vulnerability as well. The proof of concept uses the Phoenix UEFI Winflash utility to write a modified firmware to flash. Please [refer to the article about CVE-2017-8083](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/06/cve-2017-8083-compulab-intensepc-lacks-bios-wp/) for a detailed description of the proof of concept.

The latest CompuLab firmware for the Intense PC (20170521) modified with the upstream EDKII shell can be downloaded [here](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-IPC-20170521-edk2.zip).

**Mitigation**

At this time there is no means for the end user to enable Capsule Signature verification or to prevent the Phoenix update utility from updating the system firmware.

Therefore Intense PC owners should consider the following options:

* Ensure your operating system is up to date with the latest security patches. Do not run software from untrusted sources.
* Do not connect your Intense PC to any networks with internet access (i.e. air-gap the computer).
* Discontinue your use of the Intense PC and *consider replacing the computer with one from a different manufacturer who implements signature validation for firmware updates*.

Should CompuLab decide to improve the security of the Intense PC firmware by enabling Capsule Signature validation, then the above recommendations would no longer apply. However, in my communication with CompuLab regarding this issue no indication was given that they have any plans to enable Capsule Signature verification in a future update. Therefore, it seems very unlikely to me CompuLab will issue an update which enables Capsule Signature verification.

**Disclosure timeline**:

*6 June 2017:* Issue reported to CompuLab

*6 June 2017:* CompuLab confirms that “Default settings of this source tree [Phoenix SecureCore Tiano Enhanced Intel Ivy Bridge CPU Panther Point M] has disabled Capsule Signature option.”

*6 June 2017:* Issue is reported to MITRE

*6 June 2017:* Vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-9457

*7 June 2017:* CompuLab are informed that the vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2017-9457 and details of the vulnerability will be published after 45 days

   I do disagree with the idea that firmware signature validation should be mandatory (which you seem to promote), as it usually makes it impossible for free software projects like Coreboot to make compatible ports. The benefits with Coreboot are that we can get a better idea of what is running on the computer (therefore more secure) and faster boot times. Some vendor BIOSes restricts what wifi cards can be used and that is not in the user’s interest, too.

   I think it would be better with firmware signature validation that can be turned off by the user (of course in the BIOS, not from OS level).

      > I think it would be better with firmware signature validation that can be turned off by the user (of course in the BIOS, not from OS level).

      I didn’t mean to imply that the only way forward was to strictly enforce firmware signature validation. So I agree with you that the option to enforce signed firmware updates should be a requirement for anyone designing a computer.

      In the old days of BIOS, there was a write-protect jumper you could select to prevent BIOS updates. With UEFI, such a jumper is not possible anymore as flash is partitioned between ROM and EEPROM components (e.g. saving UEFI boot entries) and a write-protect jumper on the hardware part would prevent fundamental parts of UEFI from correctly functioning. Therefore write-protection must be implemented at a software level.

      The fact that a firmware signature validation option is missing completely is a huge security oversight by CompuLab and leaves their users open to malicious software installing rogue firmware updates or bricking the device. Sadly they have not shown any interest in including a firmware signature validation option.

      > The benefits with Coreboot are that we can get a better idea of what is running on the computer (therefore more secure)

      This isn’t necessarily true. Most complaints about x86 platform security stem from the [Intel Management Engine (IME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology) which Coreboot can’t disable on newer platforms (such as this one). Additionally, at a firmware level a lot of code is very specific to the exact hardware in question, and may rely on proprietary/NDA-level information (e.g. IOMMU) to achieve the same functionality as proprietary code it aims to replace.

      Having a FLOSS firmware will not necessarily lead to more people being able to improve it or fix bugs. I think this is well illustrated in the extremely small number of targets Coreboot supports.

   Gustaf, you may be pleased to hear that [I have ported coreboot to this hardware](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2017/12/coreboot-compulab-intense-pc-mintbox/), so the vendor’s lack of signature verification/enforcement is no longer a concern 🙂

# [Gigabyte MJ11-EC1 PCIe Bifurcation](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/10/gigabyte-mj11-ec1-pcie-bifurcation/)

[Leave a reply](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/10/gigabyte-mj11-ec1-pcie-bifurcation/#respond)

The Gigabyte MJ11-EC1 motherboard is an ITX motherboard with an AMD EPYC 3151 (4C8T) onboard. These motherboards were being liquidated from the [Gigabyte G431-MM0 GPU server](https://web.archive.org/web/20240407012914/https%3A//www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/GPU-Server/G431-MM0-rev-100) in 2023, and could be purchased for [around 60 Euros](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/gigabyte-mj11-ec1-epyc-3151-mystery.41395/) in the EU. The bare-bones G431-MM0 can still be purchased for around 170 Euros.

The MJ11-EC1 is very similar to the [Gigabyte MJ11-EC0](https://web.archive.org/web/20220127172803/https%3A//www.gigabyte.com/Enterprise/Server-Motherboard/MJ11-EC0-rev-12) with the main difference being the MJ11-EC0 has a PCIe x16 slot while the MJ11-EC1 has a SlimSAS (SFF-8654 8i) connector for use with the GPU riser in the G431-MM0.

You can purchase the SlimSAS cable (~18 Euros) and a PCIe riser (~15 Euros) from several AliExpress sellers. The added cost of the cable and PCIe riser does reduce the value proposition of the motherboard somewhat. Additionally, [user testing](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/gigabyte-mj11-ec1-epyc-3151-mystery.41395/page-4#post-397607) showed that PCIe bifurcation was non-functional on the SlimSAS port, meaning only a single PCIe device could be recognized on the SlimSAS 8i port unless a PCIe switch was used.

However, I can demonstrate that bifurcation does work on the MJ11-EC1, and in fact it is possible to access all PCIe x16 lanes if you add the unpopulated U2\_1 SFF-8654 connector. All the passive components for the SFF-8654 connector are already present on the motherboard, so only the physical connector needs to be added to unlock an additional 8 lanes of PCIe.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MJ11-EC1.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MJ11-EC1.jpg)

Two MJ11-EC1 motherboards, one with U2\_1 unpopulated and one with a SlimSAS 8i connector soldered

However, PCIe Bifurcation does not work under every condition. The following scenarios **do not work**:

| Cable | Adapter | Bifurcation working |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SlimSAS 8i to dual 4i | SlimSAS 4i to PCIe x4 | **No** |
| SlimSAS 8i to 8i | SlimSAS 8i to Dual NVMe | **No** |
| Dual SlimSAS 8i to 8i | PCIe x16 (JHHP1B) | **No** |

The first attempt was with a SlimSAS 8i to dual 4i cable. Unfortunately, bifurcation did not work with this cable, only one device was visible.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-4i-cable.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-4i-cable.png)

Only one device is recognized

The second attempt was with a SlimSAS 8i to dual NVMe adapter. Again, only the first NVMe device was visible, so I do not recommend purchasing this for use with the MJ11-EC1.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-DualNVMe.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-DualNVMe.png)

Only one device is recognized

I then tried this dual SlimSAS 8i to PCIe x16 adapter, which did not work **at all**. In my subsequent discussion with the vendor in the AliExpress dispute, it appears this adapter is **only compatible with their PCIe x16 to SlimSAS riser**. So despite using the SFF-8654 connector, it is not standards compliant with SlimSAS 8i and cannot be used with the MJ11-EC1. Do not purchase this.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-PCIex16-JHHP1B-2.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SlimSAS8i-PCIex16-JHHP1B-2.png)

This adapter does not work at all. Avoid purchasing the “2 Port SlimSAS 8i x2 to PCIe 4.0 x16 Slot Adapter Card SFF8654 Riser Card GEN4”

---

The following combinations are fully functional:

| Cable | Adapter | BIOS configuration | PCIe devices | Bifurcation working |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SlimSAS 8i to 8i | PCIe x8 | x8x8 | 2 | **Yes** |
| SlimSAS 8i to 8i | PCIe x8 with 4xNVMe riser, 2xNVMe | x8x4x4 | 3 | **Yes** |
| SlimSAS 8i to 8i | PCIe x8 with 4xNVMe riser, 2xNVMe | x4x4x4x4 | 4 | **Yes** |

The following SlimSAS 8i to PCIe x8 adapters were used during testing and worked as expected. The adapters were purchased with my own funds and I have no relationship to the brands or sellers.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CEACENT-CNS41CX16W.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CEACENT-CNS41CX16W.png)

CEACENT CNS41CX16W

The CEACENT CNS41CX16W places a decoupling capacitor (C21) in the path of the power connector. Cover this in glue/epoxy or it will get knocked off the board.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/N-P548-A.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/N-P548-A.png)

“SFF-8654 8i to PCIe 4.0 x16 External Graphics Card Adapter SFF-8654 8i Adapter Card” N-P548-A

The designer of this adapter does not seem to have considered the lack of clearance between the SFF-8654 and SATA power connector. I would call it “challenging” to plug in the SFF-8654 connector.

Most SFF-8654 to PCIe x8 adapters from China seem to have fundamentally flawed physical layouts, which is unfortunate given they are otherwise inexpensive and effective.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PH44PRO.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PH44PRO.png)

This NVMe adapter is great, my only wish is that they made a 1U compatible 2 NVMe version as inexpensive as the 4 NVMe model.

There are dual SlimSAS 8i to PCIe x16 adapters available, however they are cost prohibitive. Given the PCIe bifurcation options available in BIOS and the fact that there are 16 accessible PCIe lanes, I suspect a standards-compliant adapter (e.g. Ceacent CNS52CX16R) would work to expose all 16 lanes.

This was a fun modification but the economic case is dubious at best. With the SFF-8654 8i cables being roughly 18 Euros each, and SlimSAS 8i to PCIe x8 adapters ranging in price from 18-22 Euros (+shipping) the additional cost to fully utilise 16 PCIe lanes easily exceeds the entire cost of the motherboard.

The SFF-8654 connector (Amphenol U10-B074-200T) proved very hard to source from Western Distributors as they are discontinued, and are not available at a reasonable price on AliExpress. I ended up purchasing them on Taobao via a Chinese based forwarding service. The cost for QTY 20 was 523¥ on Taobao, plus forwarding agent fees, shipping to Europe, and VAT.

Soldering the connector is also a nightmare. The ground plane on the MJ11-EC1 is very effective at dissipating heat. I used a pre-heater, hot air station (set to 200C with high flow to avoid melting the plastic), leaded solder, sticky flux, and still required some touch up work with a very fine tip on the soldering iron to fix bad connections.

It should be noted that bifurcation of the populated `U2_2` SFF-8654 port works. Anyone owning the MJ11-EC1 wishing to do that just needs to flash the MJ11-EC0 BIOS via the BMC to expose PCIe bifurcation settings in BIOS, and they should be able to install two PCIe x4 devices (subject to the limitations mentioned above regarding cables/risers).

# [Meraki MG21 hardware overview and secure boot bypass](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/09/meraki-mg21-hardware-overview-and-secure-boot-bypass/)

[Leave a reply](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/09/meraki-mg21-hardware-overview-and-secure-boot-bypass/#respond)

The Meraki MG21, introduced in 2019, is a Cat 6 LTE gateway intended for fail-over connectivity. It features a soldered modem module and either two internal (MG21) or two external (MG21E) antennas.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-HW.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-HW.jpg)

Meraki MG21 LTE gateway

Here is a summary of the MG21 specs:

* Qualcomm [IPQ4029](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/internet-of-things/networking/wi-fi-networks/ipq4029) (ARM A7, 4 cores @ ~700MHz)
* 512MB DDR3 RAM (soldered)
* 128MB of NAND flash ([Winbond W29N01HV](https://web.archive.org/web/20240827113306/https%3A//www.winbond.com/hq/product/code-storage-flash-memory/slc-nand-flash/?__locale=en&partNo=W29N01HV))
* Cinterion PLAS9-X LTE Cat 6 modem module (LCC, soldered)
* Gigabit Ethernet (x2, QCA8072 PHY)
* Nano-SIM slot

---

There are no screws holding the MG21 together, the case is glued. As Meraki used glue and not adhesive to hold the MG21 together, heat does not help in opening the device. To open the MG21/MG21E: guitar picks and Isopropyl alcohol are recommended, with a lot of patience.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-disassembly.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-disassembly.jpg)

Opening the MG21 with guitar picks and Isopropyl alcohol

The 3.3V UART header in the MG21 is J5, which is unpopulated, and follows the standard Meraki pinout (1: VCC, 2: Tx, 3: Rx, 4: GND) with a 115200 baud rate. It looks like Meraki may have planned to ship the MG21 with an integrated u-blox module (U22), however on my production units the module is absent.

With the summary aside, let us focus on the secure boot status of the device. For context, see [Breaking secure boot on the Meraki Z3 and Meraki Go GX20](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2024/04/breaking-secure-boot-on-the-meraki-z3-and-meraki-go-gx20/).

Unfortunately changing the EEPROM value to the MR33 (stinkbug) does not work, because Meraki have removed support for the legacy non-secure boot devices from recent U-Boot builds:

```

The reason for this is that the EEPROM is not found. But why? We have a clue from the stock bootlog of the device:

```

[   15.287320] i2c /dev entries driver
[   15.302889] at24 0-0056: 8192 byte 24c64 EEPROM, writable, 32 bytes/write

```

The EEPROM in the MG21 has the address `0x56` instead of `0x50` as on the Z3. This causes the downgraded Z3 U-Boot build to not detect the EEPROM.

The Meraki Go GR10 (Maggot) [also has the EEPROM at address `0x56`](https://github.com/halmartin/u-boot-z3/blob/main/U-boot.Z3/board/qca/arm/ipq40xx/meraki_config.c#L57-L62):

```

struct eeprom_i2c_config
{
	uint16_t gpio_scl;
	uint16_t gpio_scl_func;
	uint16_t gpio_sda;
	uint16_t gpio_sda_func;
	uint16_t eeprom_addr;
};
/* valid eeprom configuration for insects */
static const struct eeprom_i2c_config valid_eeprom_i2c_config[] = {
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x50 }, // Stinkbug, Ladybug, Noisy Cricket
    { 10, 4, 11, 4, 0x56 }, // Maggot
};

```

However, the GR10 uses different GPIO pins to access the EEPROM.

I do not have the U-Boot source code of the MG21 to review (see endnote). Lacking the U-Boot source code, we can `hexdump` the Z3 and MG21 U-Boot regions from the flash dumps and compare.

Z3:

```

00044360  0f 00 14 00 01 00 15 00  01 00 50 00 0a 00 04 00  |..........P.....|
00044370  0b 00 04 00 56 00 00 00  00 f0 f4 a1 ea ea fb 01  |....V...........|

```

MG21:

```

000452f0  0f 00 14 00 01 00 15 00  01 00 50 00 14 00 01 00  |..........P.....|
00045300  15 00 01 00 56 00 00 00  00 f0 f4 a1 ea ea fb 01  |....V...........|

```

Decoding the structs from the `hexdump` we can infer the C source code used in the MG21 U-Boot build:

```

static const struct eeprom_i2c_config valid_eeprom_i2c_config[] = {
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x50 }, // Fuzzy Cricket, Fairyfly, Heart of Gold
    { 20, 1, 21, 1, 0x56 }, // Tie Fighter
};

```

The only difference between the MG21 and Z3 is in the EEPROM address, the GPIO configuration remains the same.

Reviewing the datasheet of the at24 EEPROM, we can see that the address is set by the first 3 pins (A0-A2) being pulled to ground or Vcc. Since the EEPROM has the address 0x56, that must correspond to the bitmask 110 or: A0: 0, A1: Vcc, A2: Vcc.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/at24c64-MG21.png)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/at24c64-MG21.png)

After some verification on the PCB, removing the surface mount resistor R50 (4.7k) above U6 will remove Vcc from A1 and A2, changing the EEPROM address from `0x56` to `0x50`.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-U6-EEPROM.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MG21-U6-EEPROM.jpg)

The signed Z3 2018 U-Boot build now properly detects the EEPROM at address `0x50` and disables signature validation on the payload.

The chain-loaded U-Boot I used as a proof-of-concept is based on the [Z3 GPL source code provided by Meraki in 2021](https://github.com/halmartin/u-boot-z3), which does not include support for the MG21. Networking is non-functional, which makes further development challenging as images must be (slowly) transferred via UART.

---

Some readers may be wondering about the MG41. This secure boot bypass does not work on the MG41.

Meraki has signed the MG41 bootloader with a unique device certificate (`x-wing`), so cross-flashing U-Boot from another device such as the Z3 will not work.

Although the FCC internal photos of the MG41 show both NAND and EMMC, the production MG41 has only EMMC present. The `boot_meraki_qca` function has been re-written as `boot_meraki_mmc_qca`. During this re-write, Meraki removed the vulnerable `switch` statement that aborts enforcing signature validation on legacy products.

---

tl;dr

1. MG21 uses the same device signing certificate as the Z3 and GX20
2. Overwrite `u-boot` on NAND with dump from Z3 running 2018 release
3. Change Product ID in EEPROM to device without secure boot (MR33)
4. Desolder R50 to change EEPROM address

The MG41 is not vulnerable to this technique.

There is still a long road ahead to support the MG21 with any custom firmware such as OpenWrt. Downgrading U-Boot on the device is not easy due to the weather proofing of the device, and the use of BGA NAND.

The GPL source code for the MG21 and MG41 was [requested from Meraki](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ff908f9a91d28c908a8d9c9abf929a8d9e9496d19c9092c08c8a9d959a9c8bc2b8afb3dfac908a8d9c9adfbc909b9adfad9a8e8a9a8c8b) in April 2024. At the time of writing Meraki has not provided any of the requested source code.

Meraki [announced the end of sale of the MG21 and MG41 in March 2024](https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Meraki_End-of-Life_%28EOL%29_Products_and_Dates), and stopped selling the MG21 and MG41 on 2024-09-18.

Meraki tries to be the Apple of SMB networking, and frequently uses premium materials like aluminum in their product designs (MS220, MS320, [MS225](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2022/10/meraki-ms210-ms225-hardware-overview/), [MS350](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2023/12/meraki-ms350-hardware-overview/), [MX84](https://watchmysys.com/blog/2023/02/meraki-mx84-overview/)). This is a bit silly for something that sits in a rack, but it is the brand image they were trying to cultivate.

The MX85 does not appear to use any aluminum in the chassis. Like the budget-oriented MS120 series, the entire MX85 chassis is made of steel. Meraki marketing will tell you this was for better cooling and is definitely not related to any cost reduction.

Meraki engineers even included thermal pads and metal spacers on top of the SFP ports (and below the PCB) to dissipate heat through the chassis. You could be forgiven for assuming they are SFP+ ports (they are not) with so much attention given to heat dissipation.

All for a device which consumes less power at idle than the (also) passively-cooled MX84, and no longer includes a spinning hard drive.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-ledboard.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-ledboard.jpg)

Unlike previous products, Meraki use glue to secure the front panel ribbon cable

---

The UART header is J3 on the MX85 and follows the standard Meraki UART pinout (1: VCC, 2: Tx, 3: Rx, 4: GND) at 3.3V and 115200 baud.

[![](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-uart.jpg)](https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MX85-uart.jpg)

**Note**: R6 and R7 are 0 ohm resistors which (dis)connect Tx and Rx lines of the SoC to the UART header. R6/R7 are **not populated by default**. You must populate them, or bridge the pads, for the UART header to function.

---

The U-Boot release on the MX85 is `2018.09julia-spl-boxwine` and, like all other recent Meraki products, it does not allow interrupting boot.

As we can see from the above `ECC off` output, the MX85 is using non-ECC RAM. This is a downgrade from the MX84 which did use ECC memory.

The MX85 also contains the Cisco TAM, implemented using a SmartFusion2 M2S010. The TAM is used for secure boot.

Vendor:
====================
CompuLab (compulab.com)

Product:
====================
Intense PC / MintBox 2

Vulnerability type:
====================
Platform lacks signature verification and does not validate firmware update before flashing

CVE Reference:
====================
CVE-2017-9457

Summary:
====================
Since 2013 CompuLab manufactures and sells the Intense PC (also sold under the name "MintBox 2"), which is a small
Intel-based fanless PC sold to end-users and industrial customers. It was discovered that there is no signature
validation of the UEFI firmware update file before flashing, allowing an attacker to silently flash a modified UEFI
firmware to flash using the standard Phoenix update utility.

CompuLab have indicated via email that capsule signature validation is disabled by default by the IBV (Phoenix) for
this platform. No timeline was provided to implement capsule signature verification.

Affected versions:
====================
All firmware versions since product release (latest public firmware is 21 May 2017)

Attack Vector:
====================
An attacker tricks the user into running a malicious executable with local administrator privileges, which updates the
system firmware to include the attacker's code. The attacker may instead use a known OS exploit to perform the upgrade
remotely (without user interaction or notification).

Proof of concept:
====================
I have created a modified firmware update which replaces the stock UEFI shell with the UEFI shell from EDK2. The update
can be flashed from within Windows without any user interaction or notification. Firmware updates are not signed by
CompuLab or verified by the existing firmware before upgrade.

The modified update, based on the 21 May 2017 firmware, can be downloaded here:
<https://watchmysys.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/update-IPC-20170521-edk2.zip>

Details of the full proof of concept can be found at the Source link above.

Mitigation:
====================
At this time there is no means for the end user to enable Capsule Signature verification or to prevent the Phoenix
update utility from updating the system firmware.

Therefore Intense PC owners should consider the following options:

- Ensure your operating system is up to date with the latest security patches. Do not run software from untrusted
sources.
- Do not connect your Intense PC to any networks with internet access (i.e. air-gap the computer).
- Discontinue your use of the Intense PC and consider replacing the computer with one from a different manufacturer who
implements signature validation for firmware updates.

Disclosure timeline:
====================
6 June 2017: Issue reported to CompuLab
6 June 2017: CompuLab confirms that “Default settings of this source tree [Phoenix SecureCore Tiano Enhanced Intel Ivy
Bridge CPU Panther Point M] has disabled Capsule Signature option.”
6 June 2017: Issue is reported to MITRE
6 June 2017: Vulnerability is assigned CVE-2017-9457
7 June 2017: CompuLab are informed that the vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2017-9457 and details of the
vulnerability will be published after 45 days
22 July 2017: Details of the vulnerability are published
