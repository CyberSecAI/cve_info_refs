  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-9457",
    "description": "CompuLab have not enabled signature checking of firmware updates for the Intense PC product line. This allows anyone in possession of the Phoenix UEFI update program to write a modified UEFI firmware to system flash. DOS/Windows versions of the Phoenix utility are easily obtained online, allowing a local or remote attacker to install a persistent firmware level rootkit to the computer, or to corrupt the system firmware, causing a denial of service. Installation of a modified firmware can occur entirely in the background, without any user interaction, and once performed is virtually impossible to difficult to detect using operating system utilities. Physical access is not required.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Intense PC (Intense PC Value, Intense PC Business, Intense PC Pro)",
      "MintBox 2"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The platform lacks signature verification and does not validate firmware updates before flashing. Capsule signature validation is disabled by default.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of firmware signature validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify the contents of the system firmware to install a persistent rootkit/bootkit, or to corrupt the firmware causing the computer to cease functioning.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Tricking the user into running a malicious executable with local administrator privileges.",
      "Using a known OS exploit to perform the upgrade remotely (without user interaction or notification)."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Local administrator privileges on the target system, or ability to execute code remotely via OS exploit. Access to the Phoenix UEFI update utility."
