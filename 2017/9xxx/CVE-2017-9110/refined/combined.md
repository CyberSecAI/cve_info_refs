### @binarycrusader **[binarycrusader](/binarycrusader)** commented [Jun 1, 2017](#issue-233010245) • edited Loading

First of all, I want to be clear that image processing is not my domain of expertise.

This pull request *attempts* to fix all of the OpenEXR CVEs, but with some caveats:

CVE Test Data

[CVE-2017-9110](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wgj2-mq2h-cpcf "CVE-2017-9110") id:000012,sig:11,src:000328+001154,op:splice,rep:16

[CVE-2017-9112](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8m57-j273-2qg9 "CVE-2017-9112") id:000103,sig:11,src:002037+004745,op:splice,rep:2

[CVE-2017-9113](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vprv-hwp3-673f "CVE-2017-9113") id:000131,sig:11,src:000514+002831,op:splice,rep:16

[CVE-2017-9114](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fqq4-jr8p-g7pr "CVE-2017-9114") id:000132,sig:11,src:000895,op:havoc,rep:32

[CVE-2017-9115](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7qw3-3fpm-j7xj "CVE-2017-9115") id:000104,sig:11,src:001329+000334,op:splice,rep:2

[CVE-2017-9116](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5h55-c648-5387 "CVE-2017-9116") id:000077,sig:11,src:002575,op:havoc,rep:4

The analysis of these CVEs seems incorrect/incomplete:

[CVE-2017-9111](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qxh9-r8xw-7v99 "CVE-2017-9111"), [CVE-2017-9115](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7qw3-3fpm-j7xj "CVE-2017-9115"), [CVE-2017-9113](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vprv-hwp3-673f "CVE-2017-9113"), [CVE-2017-9114](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fqq4-jr8p-g7pr "CVE-2017-9114")

In particular, as far as I can tell, the root cause of the crash in those four cases is a bug in the test program (exr2aces) -- not in the OpenEXR library itself.

For example, the suggested description for [CVE-2017-9111](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qxh9-r8xw-7v99 "CVE-2017-9111") says:

"[Suggested description]

In OpenEXR 2.2.0,

an invalid write of size 8 in the storeSSE function in

ImfOptimizedPixelReading.h could cause the application to crash or

execute arbitrary code."

<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/May/80>

But that's not actually correct, the bug appears to be this (exr2aces/main.cpp):

```
121 dw = h.dataWindow();

123 width  = dw.max.x - dw.min.x + 1;
124 height = dw.max.y - dw.min.y + 1;
125 p.resizeErase (height, width);

127 in.setFrameBuffer (&p[0][0] - dw.min.x - dw.min.y * width, 1, width);
```

The lines above that calculate the width and height of the framebuffer to create do so using the dataWindow property. If we use exrheader to dump that information for the related test file, we see:

```
$ exrheader id:000087,sig:11,src:000562+000300,op:splice,rep:2
...
dataWindow (type box2i): (808464432 808464432) - (808478000 808464432)
dataWinl00 (type box2i): (808464432 808464432) - (808464432 808464432)
displayWindow (type box2i): (0 0) - (63 63)
displayWs0000 (type 0000)
...

```

Now, if you refer to the OpenEXR technical introduction, pages 5-6:

<http://openexr.com/TechnicalIntroduction.pdf>

You'll note that there are no specific, obvious restrictions on the placement of the display window and data window. That is, each one defines a rectangular area. The data window defines which area pixel data is available for, while the display window just defines the location of the data to display. There is nothing that requires them to overlap as far as I can tell. It's probably not particularly useful to have the displayWindow be roughly 0,0 to 0,63 and the dataWindow to be many orders of magnitude away, but it doesn't seem to be a violation of the specification.

So really, the only bad thing about this file is wildly impractical dimensions implied by the dataWindow. Technically, the maximum dimensions of an OpenEXR image are INT\_32\*INT\_32 (box2i), so this is still within the limits from what I can see.

Now back to the bug, but with the values from exrheader substituted:

```
121 dw = h.dataWindow();

123 width  = 808478000 - 808464432 + 1;
124 height = 808464432 - 808464432 + 1;
```

Substituting the calculated width and height:

```
125 p.resizeErase (1, 13569);
```

That leads us to here; again substituting the values:

```
127 in.setFrameBuffer (&p[0][0] - -10969245413376, 1, width);
```

If you look above, it's obvious what's happening -- bad pointer math. As far as I can tell, the library itself doesn't have an issue for this particular test case; this is just bad logic in exr2aces.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Unfortunately, I was not able to secure a completed CLA from my employer. I can only offer the fix under the terms of the original license (that is, Oracle, at the time, authorized me to provide the changes under the same license as OpenEXR itself, so distributors wishing to apply the patch can assume that much). |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Subject: Multiple crashes in OpenEXR

Attached is a zip file of EXR images that cause segmentation faults in the OpenEXR library (tested against 2.2.0). <http://www.openexr.com/downloads.html> <<http://www.openexr.com/downloads.html>>

These were reported to ehanway@....com <mailto:ehanway@....com> on January 12, 2017, but no updates or information has been reported back. I have attempted to see what the status is, but no responses from ILM. Since this has surpassed the general 90-day mark as is standard for many disclosures, these are being disclosed. It’s actually been 120 days exactly.

You can see the last update to the OpenEXR codebase was on January 9. <https://github.com/openexr/openexr> <<https://github.com/openexr/openexr>>

Of note is that Adobe Photoshop actually ships with a version of OpenEXR for reading EXR images, so some of these images also crash Photoshop. ImageMagick also can support EXR image by using the OpenEXR library. <https://github.com/ImageMagick/exr/tree/master/openexr> <<https://github.com/ImageMagick/exr/tree/master/openexr>>

As of this writing, these issues are unfixed. No CVEs have been requested.

# USN-4148-1: OpenEXR vulnerabilities

7 October 2019

Several security issues were fixed in OpenEXR.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

## Details

It was discovered that OpenEXR incorrectly handled certain malformed EXR

image files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted EXR image file,

a remote attacker could cause a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-12596](/security/CVE-2017-12596))

Brandon Perry discovered that OpenEXR incorrectly handled certain malformed

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
