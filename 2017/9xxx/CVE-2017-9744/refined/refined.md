- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect size check in `sh_elf_set_mach_from_flags` function when accessing an array, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Global buffer overflow in the `sh_elf_set_mach_from_flags` function in `elf32-sh.c`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can cause a crash due to an address violation when disassembling a corrupt SH binary.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted or corrupted SH binary file with the `objdump` tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted SH binary file to `objdump` for processing. This could be a local file or a file obtained remotely.
