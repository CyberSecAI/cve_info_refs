Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `ReadMNGImage` function in `png.c` of ImageMagick. Specifically, a memory leak occurs during the processing of a crafted MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics) file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The `ReadMNGImage` function allocates memory but fails to release it properly under certain conditions, leading to a memory leak. The specific allocation is done within `ReadOneMNGImage`, called by `ReadMNGImage` on a malformed input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly processing crafted MNG files can cause the application to consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition due to exhaustion of available memory resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a specifically crafted MNG file to the `ReadMNGImage` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted MNG file to ImageMagick for processing. This might involve uploading the file to a system using ImageMagick, processing the file via a web service that uses the library, or opening the file with a vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided stack trace indicates the allocation occurs using `AcquireMagickMemory` and `AcquireQuantumMemory`, inside the `ReadOneMNGImage` function called from `ReadMNGImage`, confirming the memory leak is within the function processing the MNG image format.
- The provided testcase link allows to reproduce the vulnerability, which confirms the exploitability of this issue.
- The vulnerability affects ImageMagick version 7.0.5-6 Q16.
- It has been reported by ADLab of Venustech.
