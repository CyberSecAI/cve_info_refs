The provided content discusses a vulnerability affecting 44 iOS credit union applications, including "Peoples Bank Tulsa" (CVE-2017-9600).

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. The analysis suggests this code might be derived from a third-party library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is improper TLS certificate validation, which allows for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to intercept a user's banking username and password when they log into the affected application. This could lead to unauthorized access to the user's bank account and financial information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker would need to be within wireless range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the user's mobile device when they are logging in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept wireless traffic between the user's device and the bank's server. This can be accomplished with tools like `bettercap` by enabling HTTPS sniffing and using a POST request parser. They also need to be within wireless range (50-100ft) of the victim.
