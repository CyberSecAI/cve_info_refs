Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9554:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an information exposure issue within the `forget_passwd.cgi` script in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM). Specifically, the script does not properly handle user enumeration attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to enumerate valid usernames on the system. This is achieved through the `forget_passwd.cgi` script.
- **Lack of Rate Limiting:** There's an implicit lack of effective rate limiting on the endpoint which allows for brute-force style enumeration attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to discover valid usernames on the target DSM system. This is a key step in further attacks as knowing valid usernames can facilitate brute-forcing of passwords, spear phishing, or other targeted attacks.
- **Reduced Security Posture:** Knowledge of valid usernames can weaken the overall security of the system as it allows attackers to focus efforts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:**  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `forget_passwd.cgi` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the target DSM system.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP requests.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability

**Technical Details:**
- The specific URL to trigger the vulnerability is: `https://IP_Address:5001/webman/forget_passwd.cgi?user=XXX`, where `XXX` represents the username to test.
- Successful exploitation involves sending requests with different user values to check which ones return as valid users of the system.

**Mitigation:**
- The vendor recommends updating DSM to specific versions or higher.
- Enabling the auto-block feature in DSM can also help to mitigate brute-force attacks associated with this vulnerability
