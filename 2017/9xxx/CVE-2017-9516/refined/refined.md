Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when uploading files, specifically SVG files. The application does not adequately sanitize or block SVG files containing JavaScript, leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser context.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows the upload of SVG files without proper checks for malicious content.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS due to the execution of JavaScript embedded within the uploaded SVG files.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to:
    *   Persistent phishing attacks
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Persistent external redirects to malicious sources
    *   Persistent manipulation of affected or connected web module context

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A low-privileged user (e.g., an editor with the ability to edit news) can upload a malicious SVG file.
    *   The malicious SVG file, when accessed via a URL, executes embedded JavaScript within a user's browser.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a low-privileged user account, such as an editor account, capable of uploading files (e.g., when adding or editing news).
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code.

**Technical Details:**
The attacker uploads a crafted SVG file containing JavaScript within an `<script>` tag. The application processes the SVG file without sanitizing the embedded script. When a user accesses the SVG file (e.g., via `https://localhost/s/assets/site/xss.svg`), the browser executes the embedded JavaScript.

**Additional Information:**
The provided exploit details the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including a sample malicious SVG payload:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">

<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
   <polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
   <script type="text/javascript">
      alert(document.domain);
   </script>
</svg>
```
This vulnerability could be used by a low privileged user/editor to escalate privileges, potentially hijacking an admin account by exploiting the XSS.
