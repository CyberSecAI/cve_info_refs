Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-9429:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the 'Event List' WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'id' parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL command execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially allow for further compromise of the web server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `wp-admin/admin.php` file.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter when the `page` parameter is `el_admin_main` and the `action` parameter is `edit`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerable plugin version is <= 0.7.8.
- The exploit can be demonstrated by injecting a `SLEEP(10)` command into the `id` parameter, causing a delay in the server's response.
- The plugin has been removed from the WordPress plugin repository due to this security issue.
