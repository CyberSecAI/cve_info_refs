##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Thanks to Mibuthu for publishing an update of this plugin. I use it for several years and it suits me perfectly. After much research, I have not found such a simple plugin that also perfectly corresponds to what I want to publish. Since there hadn’t been an update in a long time, I was afraid that it would no longer follow wordpress updates. Thank you again to everyone who works there.
Keep going for a long time. Hello from France.

I’m pulling my earlier, bad review. My issue turned out to be a conflict with an older, now obsolete plugin (Amazon Associates Link Builder).
It’s also nice to see that after two years, the author has returned to working on this plugin, so there is hope that existing shortcomings will be fixed soon. My main, remaining quibble with the plugin: it would be nice to be able to use the block editor!

A really great pity. Lightweight, was exactly what I wanted & used it seamlessly. Then along came WPv5 and the wheels simply fell off. Played merry hell with my floating menu bar and my footer simply disappeared. How a simple plug-in could have that sort of effect beats me, but it did. Deactivated the plugin and all was sweetness and light again.
… and to cap it all, it bears the classic symptoms of having been abandoned. I hope I’m wrong, because I’d have given it five stars if it still worked,
Ah well.

After a long time using this plug in, which I found reliable and nice, I faced the surprise that with the last update ALL the previous events were lost!…I tried to have some kind of help through the forum but none of the developer did answer. I know it is a free plug in, but at the least an answer would have been polite! Now all I all I can do is find another resource and quit event-list for good…
