- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the algorithm used by Comcast gateways to generate the "password-of-the-day" (POTD) for SSH/CLI sessions. Attackers can reverse engineer the algorithm to generate valid POTDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable password generation. The use of a password-of-the-day mechanism that is vulnerable to reverse engineering.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the target gateway over SSH by generating the correct POTD.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack where the attacker needs to interact with the SSH/CLI interface of the targeted Comcast gateway.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to a way to interact with the SSH/CLI interface and the ability to reverse engineer the password generation algorithm.
