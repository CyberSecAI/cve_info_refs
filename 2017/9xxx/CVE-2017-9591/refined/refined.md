The provided content describes a vulnerability affecting 44 credit union apps for iOS, including the "PCB Mobile" app (CVE-2017-9591).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications, possibly derived from third-party code. The exact nature of the certificate validation flaw is not specified in this article.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Usernames and passwords for the affected banking applications can be silently intercepted by a nearby attacker while a user logs into the app.

**Attack vectors:**
- Wireless interception of network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the victim using the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack using tools like bettercap to intercept and capture the credentials sent during login.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform HTTPS sniffing and use a "POST" request parser to capture the credentials.
