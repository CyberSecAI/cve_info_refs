The provided content discusses a vulnerability affecting multiple iOS applications, including "First State Bank of Bigfork Mobile Baâ€¦", which is listed with CVE-2017-9595.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. The article mentions that this code might be derived from a third-party component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This allows for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept the banking username and password of a user while they are logging into the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is carried out via a MitM attack by an attacker within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker can passively intercept data, requiring no interaction from the victim other than using the app while on the same network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the user (estimated 50-100 feet).
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, including setting up an malicious access point and enabling HTTPS sniffing on the network.
- The attacker is not required to be on the same physical network, but be able to intercept the traffic of the target application.
