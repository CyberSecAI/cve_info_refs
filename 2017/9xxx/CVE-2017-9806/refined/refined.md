**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the OpenOffice Writer's DOC file parser, specifically in the `WW8Fonts` constructor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write. The `WW8Fonts` constructor has a flaw that allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated memory boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): Triggering the vulnerability leads to memory corruption and application crash.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: The memory corruption could be exploited further, allowing the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted DOC files: Attackers can create specially crafted DOC files that, when parsed by OpenOffice Writer, trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create/modify DOC files: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify DOC files to inject the malicious data.
- User interaction: The victim needs to open the malicious DOC file using a vulnerable version of OpenOffice Writer for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered to have a medium severity.
- There were no known exploits at the time of discovery, but a proof-of-concept was created to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos.
- The vulnerability affects all Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.3 and older, as well as older OpenOffice.org versions.
- The fix is available in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4.
