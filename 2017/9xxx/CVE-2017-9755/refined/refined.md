The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9755.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A global-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists within the `OP_G` function in `i386-dis.c` of binutils. This is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when handling bnd registers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `OP_G` function, which is triggered when parsing certain x86 instructions, specifically when an invalid bnd register number (greater than 3) is encountered. This improper handling causes a write outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability can cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering a crash. It is noted in the Gentoo Security Advisory that this vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service condition by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially crafted file.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is by providing a specially crafted binary file that, when processed by `objdump` or other binutils tools, triggers the vulnerable code path in `OP_G`. The provided fuzzing test case and ASAN report demonstrates the issue using `objdump -D <file>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to entice a user to use a vulnerable version of `binutils` to process a specially crafted file that contains the triggering instruction sequence. This is described in the Gentoo security advisory.

The bug report from sourceware.org provides more specific details on the vulnerability, including a stack trace, test case, and the resolution via code commits.
