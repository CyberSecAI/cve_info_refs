Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow located in the `Ins_JMPR` function within the `base/ttinterp.c` file of Ghostscript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:**  The `Ins_JMPR` function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption. The specific location of the overflow is `base/ttinterp.c:1801`.
*   **Invalid Read:** There are multiple invalid reads of size 1 at different locations of the program, suggesting a general issue related to memory handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The heap-buffer-overflow can corrupt memory, which can lead to a crash.
*   **Denial of Service:** The crash caused by the vulnerability can lead to denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While not explicitly stated in the provided text, a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions that the worst case could result in arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted PostScript File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PostScript or PDF file.
*   **XPS File Processing:** The vulnerability was also found using an XPS file. The report mentions using `gxps` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PostScript, PDF, or XPS file to be processed by a vulnerable version of Ghostscript. This means an attacker could use social engineering to get a user to open a malicious file, or they could host a malicious file on a website that a user may visit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bug report mentions that the crash doesn't occur in a non-ASan environment, but memory corruption does occur in ASan or Valgrind environments. This suggests the vulnerability may be related to a specific memory allocation or management error.
*   The vulnerability was reported against Ghostscript versions 9.22 and Git Head: [937ccd17ac65935633b2ebc06cb7089b91e17e6b](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?937ccd17ac65935633b2ebc06cb7089b91e17e6b) .
*   The vulnerability was fixed with commit [c501a58f](http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c501a58f)
*   The issue was found in the GhostXPS product.

This analysis provides more technical detail than the basic CVE description, including the specific function and file involved, the memory corruption, and how to trigger the issue, as well as the specific commit that fixes the vulnerability.
