  "content": "The provided document contains release notes for Open-Xchange AppSuite version 7.8.3. It includes a section detailing fixes for vulnerabilities in patch release 4256, one of which is identified as CVE-2017-9809. \n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The document does not specify the root cause of CVE-2017-9809, it only indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in this patch.\n\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The document lacks technical details, so the specific weaknesses present are unknown. It's classified as a vulnerability, indicating a flaw in the software.\n\n- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability's impact is rated as CVSS: 3.1, with a vector of (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). This translates to:\n    - **Availability (A):** None. There is no impact on system availability.\n    - **Confidentiality (C):** Low. There may be some potential for limited information disclosure.\n    - **Integrity (I):** None. There is no impact on data integrity.\n\n    - This suggests that if the vulnerability is exploited, there might be a minor impact on confidentiality, but no impact on integrity or availability. \n\n- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is Network (AV:N), indicating that the vulnerability is exploitable over a network.\n\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have these capabilities:\n    -   **Low Privileges (PR:N):** No prior authorization is required. This means that any user on the network can initiate the attack.\n    -   **High Attack Complexity(AC:H):** The attack is not easy to carry out. It requires special conditions, such as exploitation of a separate vulnerability or a non-standard system configuration.\n    -   **User interaction (UI:R):** User interaction is required in order to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would likely have to induce the user to perform an action like clicking a malicious link.\n"
