#### [55409](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55409) Contact sort orders are inconsistent between "address book" and "select address dialog"

Contacts were just sorted by the first character. This has been fixed by adding recursion when letters are equal.

#### [55362](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55362) Translation missing on upload timeout error

## Patch Release 4376 (2017-10-04)

### Shipped Components and Versions

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.3-rev35
* Open-Xchange AppSuite frontend 7.8.3-rev31

### Fixed Bugs

#### [55455](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55455) Contacts export and have EOL

LF character was used as line terminator in exported CSV files. Outlook was not able to handle those files. This has been solved by using CRLF sequence as line terminator in exported CSV files.

#### [55425](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55425) Unclear behaviour on versioning when uploading files upper/lower case

File name check was case-sensitive.Now file names check ignoring case to have a standardized procedure.

#### [55175](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55175) Mail Module does not render thumbnails for .txt

This has been solved by adding `txt` to regex of supported file extensions for preview.

#### [54750](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54750) TO: with IDN scrambled after reply

The mail sent by thunderbird does not contain the ASCII representation of the mail address. Instead it contains the unexpected IDN representation. This was fixed in javax.mail as it deals with unexpected mail content. Try to parse with the default java charset. If ASCII is provided (as expected) nothing will change.

## Patch Release 4353 (2017-09-18)

### Shipped Components and Versions

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.3-rev34
* Open-Xchange AppSuite frontend 7.8.3-rev30
* Open-Xchange AppSuite documentconverter 7.8.3-rev8

### Fixed Bugs

#### [55265](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55265) High load on configdb DB ReadSlave

Excessive querying of all context identifiers, likely caused by unnecessarily "per node" initialization of default attachment storage cleaner. Solution: Efficient retrieval of distinct context identifiers per schema and refactored default attach- ment storage cleaner to be managed as cluster task (runs only once, no more per node).

#### [55254](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55254) Rename / delete folders in OX Drive not possible

Creation of trash and public folders on demand was removed. This has been solved by reenabling the creation of trash and public folder on demand.

#### [55229](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55229) Japanese text is garbled in App Suite

Some Japanese characters are not display correctly (garbled) in emails. This has been fixed by using "x-windows-iso2022jp" charset in case Javas "iso-2022-jp" charset yields unmapped characters.

#### [55175](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55175) Mail Module does not render thumbnails for .txt

This has been solved by adding `txt` to regex of supported file extensions for preview.

#### [55162](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55162) Inline images at HTML mails disappear after a short time

Sometimes added Inline images disappered while composing a new email. This got solved by not advertising the `Content-Length` header for retrieved images from mail storage as associated MIME part does not provide exact size to solve this issue.

#### [51093](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51093) "Switch to parent folder" leads to hidden root for external storages

In case the `com.openexchange.java-commons.logback-extensions` bundle has not been started an attempt to register its MBean failed. Await availability of Logstash Socket Appender instance prior to attempting to register its MBean to solve this issue.

## Patch Release 4327 (2017-09-04)

#### [55096](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55096) Dragging a folder into Drive in App Suite UI results in unspecific error

UI changed response so it looked like the currently logged in user confirmed the appointment. This has been fixed by using the actual user that confirmed instead of the currently logged in user.

#### [55012](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55012) "Email has no recipient" message is shown after deleting a duplicated recipient

This was caused by same identifier in collection and has been fixed by using unique identifiers so there are no duplicates anymore.

#### [54879](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54879) Quotes in email local part not allowed

Possible quotes (") in local part of an E-Mail address were handled as special characters. Now orderly handle quotes in local part of an E-Mail address to solve this issue.

#### [54232](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54232) File names are case sensitive

The filename reservation logic recorded possibly conflicting filenames in a map using case-sensitive keys. This has been solved by tracking possibly conflicting filenames ignoring case.

CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

### Fixed Bugs

#### [54944](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54944) Subject line with UTF-8 characters are jumbled up

Mixed encoded values are not properly combined. Properly combine mixed encoded values to solve this issue.

#### [54894](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54894) E-mail gets only displayed partly

Mail uses absolute positioning. Email exceeded internal limit (32KB) for specific post-processing. Raise size limit for that particular post-processing to 128KB for Chrome, 64KB for other browsers to display those emails.

#### [54877](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54877) Tasks cannot be deleted

Duplicate entries were written to the `del_task` folder table. This has been fixed by only writing the most current ones.

#### [54863](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54863) Restart of more than one middleware nodes take a long time

This has been solved by avoiding too many request to all possible DB-Schemas and improving start-up of middleware nodes for setups holding millions of contexts.

#### [54534](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54534) Socket monitoring support

To allow debugging potential network and remote service issues more efficiently, we added sup- port to log connection status and usage metrics for each socket that gets opened to an external system (e.g. Database, IMAP). See Change SCR-24 for more information.

#### [53947](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53947) Monthly calendar view does not scroll to previous month

Previous month scrollposition was unreachable due to endless scrolling. This has been fixed by drawing an additional month if trying to scroll to the first drawn month.

#### [53454](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53454) A IMAP folder called "user" is visible

"user" folder remained in child listing of root folder. Orderly drop single namespace folders from LSUB collection to solve this issue.

## Patch Release 4303 (2017-08-07)

### Shipped Components and Versions

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.3-rev31
* Open-Xchange AppSuite frontend 7.8.3-rev27

### Fixed Bugs

#### [54808](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54808) CacheAware does not work for Drive folders

When programmatically working with Drive folders, they could be declared to be `CacheAware` but this property did not change the folders behavior in terms of cache handling. This has been resolved and needs to he validated at the specific implementation.

#### [54790](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54790) Getting quota does not work anymore

When requesting quota information for non-existing file storage accounts a runtime exception was thrown instead of properly handling the case. This has now been corrected.

#### [54702](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54702) Rename folder pop-up not closing

The dialog to rename a folder in App Suite would not close under very special conditions. This has been researched and a potential workaround got applied. The effectiveness of this solutions needs to be validated for the environment in question.

#### [54701](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54701) Unable to copy raw image content to mail compose with IE11

When copying raw image content from apps like MS Paint to mail compose, rather than just adding that image via drag&drop or the provided composer options, its content did not get pasted when using IE11. This has been corrected for this particular case, however note that copy&paste is implemented very inconsistently across browsers and operating systems, other cases will potentially not work as expected since the browser does not provide necessary information to web applications.

#### [54586](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54586) Inconsistency for saving drafts when using attachments from Drive

When adding attachments to a Mail from OX Drive, they were added when saving a mail as draft but not removed when removing the attachment. This behavior has been corrected in a way that mail attachments are never stored when saving as draft.

#### [54453](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54453) Account help page missing

A particular help page for external accounts was incorrectly linked, this has been corrected.

#### [54437](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54437) Contact collector not working

Collecting contact information while reading mail was not working when combining specific mail handling (seen/unseen) in combination with contact collection. This has been solved.

#### [51742](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51742) Usability improvement when handling appointment invitations

When receiving invitations or modifications of an appointment, we did show a very prominent pane that allows users to accept/decline. However some users still tried to manually import the attached ICS file which led to a series of problems. This is now being avoided by hiding ICS attachments in cases where we already show the accept/decline pane.

#### [51194](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51194) Ability to disable adding attachments to PIM apps via configuration

A new frontend-side configuration option has been added to disable the "add attachment" area when creating or editing PIM objects. Note that this is purely cosmetic and does not affect other clients than OX App Suite. See Change #4301 for more information.

### Shipped Components and Versions

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.3-rev30

### Fixed Bugs

#### [54723](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54723) Busy circle never stops on attachment uploads

Tried to create previews for documents for local files. This has been solved by not trying to create previews for documents for local files.

#### [54593](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54593) No error message if import limit is reached

No warning given in case number of imported items were truncated. This has been fixed by adding warning if number of imported objects were truncated.

#### [54529](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54529) Drive mail drive attachment counting filesize against upload limit

Any mail attachment appended to the new message has been checked against upload quota limitation. Only consider uploaded file (mail attachments) when checking upload quota limitation to solve this issue.

### Fixed Vulnerabilities

#### [54403](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54403) CVE-2017-9809

CVSS: 3.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

#### [54402](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54402) CVE-2017-9808

CVSS: 3.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

#### [54320](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54320) CVE-2017-9808

CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

### Fixed Bugs

#### [54532](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54532) Confusing error message "Folder INBOX has been closed on mail server"

Confusing displayed error message. Solution: Rephrased error messages dealing about connectivity issues to mail server to have a more user-friendly information. Moreover added the "Please try again later." suffix to hint to a possibly temporary nature of the issue.

#### [54377](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54377) Generating missing MD5 sums on filestore Objects causes high read load

There might be situations where the metadata for stored infostore documents does not indicate the referenced files MD5 checksum. This may be the case for files that were stored more than 4 years ago, or for files that have been uploaded in chunks, e.g. during a migration. When synchronizing via OX Drive, the missing checksums for those files are calculated on demand, which requires the files to be retrieved from the underlying storage. When having many or very large files where the checksum needs to be calculated for, this may lead to an increased read load which may impact other processes and systems in the installation. This has been fixed by providing functionality to calculate missing file checksums on demand.

#### [54349](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54349) Edge crashes on large attachments

Too much memory and CPU usage by canvas resize. Integrate canvas resize into our lazyload mechanism so not every picture is processed simultaniously to solve this issue.

#### [54348](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54348) Attachment filename wrong when forward email

Building the forwarded mail calling setHeader erased the header information about file name. This has been solved by calling `setHeader` first and set the file name header afterwards.

#### [54311](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54311) Unable to send mail with onboard external account as sender

A SMTP server which responds with non standards-compliant multi-line greeting on socket connect messed up parsing of serverâs capabilities. This has been solved by dealing with multi-line greetings from SMTP server.

#### [54262](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54262) No timeout message if loading modules fails

No error message on require timeout. This has been fixed by adding timeout message and reload option with longer timeout (30 seconds).

#### [54177](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54177) Creating folders or renaming folders to prefix A- or B- does not show

The folder title gets not re-rendered after a title change. Now after a title change also the folder title gets re-rendered.

#### [53454](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53454) A IMAP folder called "user" is visible

"user" folder remained in child listing of root folder. Orderly drop single namespace folders from LSUB collection to solve this issue.

### Shipped Components and Versions

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.3-rev27
* Open-Xchange AppSuite frontend 7.8.3-rev24

### Fixed Bugs

#### [54315](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54315) Incompatibility with SIEVE rules

When running OX App Suite 7.8.3 and 7.8.4 against a shared mail environment, SIEVE filter rules could unintentionally affect each other, for example auto-forward and vacation notice. This got fixed by retaining commented script content which is unknown to the 7.8.4 implementation.

#### [54309](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54309) Re-authorizing a oAuth account led to errors

When re-authorizing a oAuth account, for example after changing its password or revoking access, a runtime exception was thrown. This got fixed by considering empty authorization tokens.

#### [54181](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54181) Config-cascade inconsistency for value pairs

Certain value pairs where not correctly distributed by the config cascade mechanism, especially those related to services that use oAuth for authentication. We solved this by making those properties config-cascade aware.

#### [54174](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54174) Unexpected oAuth option for external accounts

When having external mail access via oAuth disabled, the corresponding option was not properly hidden. This got solved to immediately start the non-oAuth wizard instead.

#### [54136](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54136) Incorrect permission restriction when moving folders in Drive

When moving/copying a folder from a external storage service to folder of the primary OX Drive storage service, a permission related error was thrown. This got solved by properly setting administrator privileges to the creator of a OX Drive folder while copying/moving in folders from external services.

#### [54133](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54133) Sharing dialog stuck when sharing locked file

When attempting to share a file which is locked, the sharing dialog did not close when canceling the operation. This got solved by handling potential errors related to locks when trying to share a file.

#### [54069](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54069) Fuzzy fallback for unsupported languages

In certain cases the frontend language did fall back to german instead of english. This got fixed by setting a explicit fallback to en\_US if the browser provides a unsupported language and no previously set OX language cookie.

#### [54067](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54067) Outdated "unsupported browsers" message

OX App Suite UI did display incorrect recommendations for mobile browsers when using such as a desktop browser. This has been solved and we're now showing recommendations for mobile browsers only when using a mobile device.

#### [54042](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54042) Unable to update dates with Japanese locale

When defining start/end dates at the calendar on mobile browsers, the supplied data did not get taken over to the appointment. This was caused by incompatibility of a date/time format library with specific languages and has been fixed by making sure the same date/time format is used at all related components.

#### [54041](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54041) Missing schema information for database timeout errors

In case a database connection reported a communication failure or timeout, the specific database schema was not part of the exception. This has now been added to allow simple debugging of affected database clusters.

#### [53958](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53958) More debug background for exceptions related to closed IMAP folders

In case a IMAP backend did close a connection due to technical issues or timeouts, the resulting stack-trace at OX App Suite middleware was rather generic. This has been improved in a way that we now show the related IMAP command to allow better debugging. This issue has to be validated in production environments that show such unexpected behavior.

#### [53945](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53945) Duplicate paste on certain systems

On few macOS based systems images were pasted twice to mail compose when using the operating systems copy&paste feature and hitting a specific timing pattern. Additional checks were added to avoid importing duplicate content.

#### [53923](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53923) Quick reply disappears after the first reply

When using "quick reply" to answer a mail, this option will disappear. We changed the behavior in a way that the option stays available after using it.

#### [53916](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53916) Adding local files opens camera App on iOS

When using OX App Suite UI with Safari on iOS, the action to add a local attachment resulted in immediate launch of the camera App. We now trigger a selection menu which offers to either use the camera or access existing photos on the device.

#### [53688](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53688) Contacts with Katakana "yomi" fields were sorted as "other"

When using Japanese language settings and subsequently "yomi" contact fields, those contacts were sorted incorrectly as "other", which got solved.

#### [53671](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53671) Specific mails produced empty printouts

When printing specific mails that define CSS, the created print version did not show substantial content. This got fixed by dropping certain CSS elements from our whitelist that could lead to broken layouts. See Change #4204.

#### [53649](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53649) Folder IDs were shown in PIM objects attachment details

For PIM objects with attachments we did show the hyperlinks pointing to OX Drive instead of the corresponding App. To avoid confusion we did visually remove those links as they provide almost no functionality.

#### [53474](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53474) Duplicate recipients when sending mail

When sending a mail to all appointment participants the resulting mail compose did contain duplicates of the expected recipients. This got solved by detecting and removing the currently logged in user from that list.

#### [53437](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53437) Inconsistency for thumbnails and image preview

Certain file formats (tiff, psd, pbm) were shown as thumbnail preview while not being supported in image preview. To ensure consistency we added support for tiff and psd files to image preview.

#### [52633](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52633) Adding huge photos to HTML mail led to high CPU load

When checking for validity of a uploaded image, the size limitations were not considered, which in turn led to higher than expected processing effort. The logic got changed to apply limitations prior to analyze validity of an image. If that action fails, the affected image is being removed from mail compose and a error is logged.

When updating an OAuth account (applying a new name), the enabled scopes was accidentally reseted.This has been solved by not touching OAuth account's enabled scopes when updating its name.

#### [53795](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53795) POP3 External account: messages retrieved are duplicated

Certain POP3 server's do not obey to advertise UIDLs with at max. 70 characters.This has been fixed by extending the "uidl" column in "pop3\_storage\_ids" and "pop3\_storage\_deleted" tables from 70 to 128 characters as some POP3 server advertise bigger UIDL values. An Updatetask will be triggered with this fix.

#### [53690](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53690) Fields considered for sorting / categorizing contacts inconsistent

A contact's (yomi-) firstname was not taken into account during sort name generation in case no (yomi-) lastname was set.This has been solved by using combination of (yomi-) last- and firstname per default as sort name.

#### [53689](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53689) Yomi fields not available / visible with non-Japanese language setting

Missing feature for other languages.Added new setting and feature to make yomi fields with other languages.

#### [53688](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53688) Contacts with Katakana "yomi" fields are sorted and categorized as "other"

#### [53674](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53674) Japanese attachment filenames broken for some sender MUAs

"name" and "filename" values were parsed in a wrong way from parameter list of Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers.This has been fixed by properly parsing file name from MIME part headers.

#### [53524](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53524) Japanese translation: Inconsistent translation for the word "all"

Some are translated with Kanji and the others with Hiragana, which gives the end users inconsistent look and feel.Now all are translated with Hiragana.

#### [53340](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53340) Appointment status of participant not updated via EAS

The list of confirmations was not part of the USM sync-state.USM syncs now the list of confirmations from the backend to solve this issue.

#### [53233](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53233) No appropriate folder storage for tree identifier "0" and folder identifier "label"

Used dummy folder\_id 'label'.This has been fixed by using 'virtual/label' now to avoid that an invalid ID is used in server requests.

#### [53790](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53790) Problem with executing SQL: Deadlock found when trying to get lock

Possible dead lock situation through concurrent context create operations that imply to add data to "contextAttribute" table in context-associated payload database.This has been solved by adding retry strategy with exponential back-off and added optional lock to 'contextAttribute' table to ultimately serialize concurrent write operations. Whether the lock is supposed to be acquired is controlled through newly introduced "LOCK\_ON\_WRITE\_CONTEXT\_INTO\_PAYLOAD\_DB" property in file 'hosting.properties'. Default is "false".

#### [53521](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53521) Japanese translation for "Save to Drive" has superfluous letters "()"

Fixed superfluous trailing letters for Japanese.

#### [53456](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53456) Mail content not displayed with broken content type

#### [53267](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53267) Folder-mapping for external IMAP accounts won't be temporary shown after password change and a new 'Sent objects' folder gets created

Wrong look-up of standard folder in session-associated cache, which contains wrong entries in case password has been changed.This has been fixed by simply loading mail account data as-is and do not consider any caches.

#### [53249](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53249) Not possible to delete pop3 account

The server tried to remove the pop3 folders multiple times.Now let the server remove pop3 folders only once.

#### [53095](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53095) OAuth accounts broken after downgrade from Groupware to PIM role

Need of improvement in case access to OAuth-backed data is not/should not be possible as per configuration and missing scope authorization.Solution: Explicitly check whether OAuth provider has been enabled (OAUTH-0044), required scope(s) is/are available (OAUTH-0043), and required scope(s) is/are enabled/authorized (OAUTH-0042). Also added new error codes to the UI.

#### [52633](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52633) Drag & drop of a huge picture into a HTML-Mail will cause the JVM to OOM/ up until OS swapped

When the ui is refreshed, all parents of all folders are listed. That causes every refresh to request the folder with id "9".This has been fixed by only adding favorite folders for modules with granted permission.

#### [51757](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51757) When the first mail filter rule is created for a user, it does not show in the mail filter list

* Open-Xchange usm 7.8.3-rev7

### Fixed Bugs

#### [51967](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51967) Missing distribution lists in Outlook

When syncing Outlook using USM, certain amounts and combinations of contacts and distribution lists could lead to a situation where only a subset of contacts but not all distribution lists got synced. This has been solved by sorting the type of object (contact, distribution list) prior to performing the sync operation. This way the kind of objects retrieved at the client side stays consistent in case the total amount of objects exceeds the chunk size for one sync operation.

#### [51399](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51399) Repeated mail sending when using Outlook

In case a backend error did occur, like downtime of the mail storage, there could be situations where Outlook clients using USM get into a sending-loop, resulting to duplicated E-Mail. Those kind of errors are now handled by the USM API in accordance to the OX App Suite middleware error code. Backend version 7.8.3-rev20 or higher is needed for this fix.

### Fixed Bugs

#### [52518](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52518) Compatibility fix for Debian and systemd

The Debian project did rename the initial process from `systemd` to `init` when moving to Debian 8.7. Some areas of our startup scripts depend on this name to determine whether systemd is used or not. We're now querying `/proc/1/comm` to figure out the kind and name of process that takes care about inits.

#### [52437](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52437) oxsysreport tries to read nonexisting files

When running `oxsysreport` while having OX Guard installed, false-positives for password blacklisting could occur. As a result errors were reported by the `oxsysreport` tool, which has been solved by adjusting the regular expression for parameter blacklisting.

#### [52314](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52314) Unicode decoding fails for multi-line mail subjects

In case a E-Mail subject spans multiple lines where each consists of UTF-8 mail-safe base64 encoded characters, decoding partly failed and Unicode characters were displayed in a scrambled way. This has been solved by properly handling such split subjects and encoding each part independently.

#### [52238](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52238) Typo at NRFILES property at startscript

A typo at the `/opt/open-xchange/sbin/open-xchange` script led to a situation where custom configured "nofiles" limits where not correctly applied to the process. This has been solved by correcting the properties name and adding a log message to `open-xchange-console.log` in case the process fails to set this limit.

#### [52235](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52235) Missing custom favicons

Newer versions of Firefox use the largest icon presented as  as favicon, which defaults to a unbranded OX icon. Originally this handling was introduced to set a "homescreen" icon when using the appropriate functionality on mobile operating systems. This was solved by removing the corresponding tag when using desktop operating systems.

#### [52198](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52198) Applying OX Drive folder permissions recursively

A feature backport has been performed to allow recursive inheritance of OX Drive folder permissions when changing a parent folder.

#### [52181](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52181) Firefox drop-zone overlaps mail list

When using a specific series of gestures while importing a .eml file to a mailbox, a Firefox bug on Windows and macOS got triggered which kept the "drop zone" visible after dropping the file outside of the browser window. This subsequently blocked other user interaction with the mail list. We added a workaround for this browser bug in a way that clicking outside the drop zone will revert its state.

#### [52161](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52161) Missing mails on mobile devices when using mail categories

When using mail categories with a desktop browser and moving mails to specific categories, those mails would not be displayed at Inbox anymore when using the same account using a mobile browser. We solved this by avoiding categorization Inbox if the corresponding feature set is not available on the currently used platforms.

#### [52157](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52157) IMAP master-auth user name provided to client

In case of specific IMAP errors related to `EXPUNGE` commands, a detailed error message was returned to the user, which could contain a user-name for IMAP master authentication. This was solved by removing detailed error message contents for that IMAP command.

#### [52151](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52151) Drop zone for .eml not disappearing if a file is not dropped with firefox on Windows

Firefox does not trigger dragleave or mouseout correctly.This has been fixed by using mouseenter to remove the dropzone when the mouse enter the window without dragged files.

#### [52123](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52123) Unable to change mail account name with certain mail configurations

If a user was changing its mail account displayname while the middleware uses a "global" `mailServerSource` setting, incorrect host names were applied. As a result the displayname could not be changed. We solved this by applying the appropriate host name to avoid erroneous responses during the operation.

#### [52104](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52104) Untraceable database timeouts during share cleanup

Once the `PeriodicCleaner` task for shares was executed, potential SQL errors could not be traced since the related schema name was unknown. To allow further debugging we added`com.openexchange.database.schema` as parameter for this cleanup run. It will highlight which database schema triggered timeouts or other errors.

#### [51997](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51997) Shares created via Drivemail requested credentials

When sending a mail attachment and using "Drive Mail" a password was requested even though a user did not enable this option. This could happen in cases where a user first specified a password but then un-ticked the related option. We solved this by checking the options state more carefully prior to creating the related share.

#### [51967](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51967) Missing distribution lists in Outlook

When syncing Outlook using USM, certain amounts and combinations of contacts and distribution lists could lead to a situation where only a subset of contacts but not all distribution lists got synced. This has been solved by sorting the type of object (contact, distribution list) prior to performing the sync operation. This way the kind of objects retrieved at the client side stays consistent in case the total amount of objects exceeds the chunk size for one sync operation.

#### [51918](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51918) Calendar conflicts with UTC+12 timezones

During conflict detection, the floating time-span of full-day appointments was calculated using the servers timezone (usually UTC) while other appointments used the timezone configured by the user. In cases where a large offset to UTC is present, there has been a 50/50 chance that appointments would conflict with full-day appointments at the previous or next day. We're now calculating both values using the users specific timezone for conflict handling. This should bring down the probability of incorrect conflicts considerably.

#### [51839](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51839) Certain serious (non UCE/UBE) HTML mail is not displayed

Too greedy check for possibly malicious content led to this issue.This has been solved by allowing properly parsed start tag.

#### [51462](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51462) Full-day appointments could not be converted with Lightning

When using Thunderbird/Lightning and CalDAV of OX App Suite, full-day appointments could not be converted back to normal appointments using the CalDAV client. The reason for this was a client-specific CalDAV header used to indicate full-day appointments which caused issues with Lightning. We removed this header if the associated user-agent does not expect it.

#### [51399](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51399) Repeated mail sending when using Outlook

In case a backend error did occur, like downtime of the mail storage, there could be situations where Outlook clients using USM get into a sending-loop, resulting to duplicated E-Mail. Those kind of errors are now handled by the USM API in accordance to the OX App Suite middleware error code.

#### [51222](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51222) Long loading times for documents with certain storages

In case a large document gets requested off a slow cloud storage, very long loading times could happen and expected timeouts were not considered. This has been solved by adding additional timeouts that will kick in if a API request to the storage layer takes longer than anticipated.

#### [51074](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51074) Encoding issues with passwords

In case certain operating systems got configured incorrectly, specifically RHEL6 and SLES11, usage of the `open-xchange-passwordchange-script` plugin could lead to incorrectly encoded passwords passed over to a script. This has been solved by adding an optional parameter as described by Change #4022 to allow base64 encoded transfer. Additionally, unexpected encoding configurations will get logged to `open-xchange-console.log` to alert operators about potential follow-up issues.

#### [50918](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50918) Timezone issues with task start/due dates on negative timezone offsets

When defining a start or due date for tasks while using a negative UTC offset, the selected date would be reported incorrectly. This has been solved by adjusting the full-day handling for tasks to the calendar implementation which uses UTC.

#### [49236](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49236) Messages regarding missing E-Mail

Some OX App Suite UI requests did lead to error messages regarding E-Mail which could not be found. After analyzing the situation, we suspect that there is a issue with obfuscated folder names. A fallback has been added in case decoding a folder name failed.

## Patch Release 4016 (2017-03-20)

### Shipped Components and Versions

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.3-rev18
* Open-Xchange AppSuite frontend 7.8.3-rev17

### Fixed Bugs

#### [52013](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52013) Enhancements to IMAP host detection and logging

To allow better debugging and monitoring of interaction between OX App Suite and IMAP backends, a new parameter was added to parse the IMAP backends "greeting" and provide it as part of the OX App Suite log. This behaviour is configurable and described within release notes. When rolling out this Patch Release.

#### [51910](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51910) Optimizing IMAP IDLE handling and Hazelcast lookups

When using IMAP IDLE in larger deployments (which OX does not recommend) it might happen that threads are getting blocked by attempts to look up and close associated push listeners in a cluster once a user closes a session. Using synchonization protocols like Exchange Active Sync triggers many sessions to be opened and closed in a relatively short period of time. While there might be configurations where only one IMAP IDLE push listener per user is allowed, in many cases this level of consistency is excessive and could lead to outages. Therefor we changed the behaviour to only look up "local" sessions rather than querying the whole cluster. This behaviour is configurable and described within release notes. When rolling out this Patch Release please have a close look to IMAP IDLE session count and modify the configuration in accordance to the environments requirements. To enhance overall performance of session lookups, a index has been added to the Hazelcast "sessions" map. As a result, clusters need to be completely updated and restarted when applying this patch release, the "sessions" map is not compatible with its earlier version.

#### [51847](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51847) Enhanced IMAP request tracking

Logging has been extended to allow tracking individual IMAP activities/requests for a OX App Suite session which might use several IMAP connections. The new logging property is
 `com.openexchange.mail.session`.

#### [51772](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51772) Unable to modify users own data

In cases where the contact associated to the user account was created by the "oxadmin" account rather than the user itself, the user was unable to change its own contact data. Such situations may arise in specific provisioning implementations. Changing the contacts data is now possible again by correcting the mechanism to look up the oxadmin account as potential creator for the own contact.

#### [51755](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51755) Long-running script warnings when sending mail to huge recipient list

When composing a mail to a list of several hundreds of recipients, browser warnings about unresponsive scripts occurred when trying to parse and tokenize the recipient list. The handling has been improved by 2-3x to allow a larger number of recipients.

#### [51610](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51610) Desktop notifications are not shown for negative timezone offsets

When configuring a negative timezone offset (e.g. UTC-5), desktop notifications would not be shown since the timestamp of newly received mails was checked against UTC rather than the users timezone.

#### [51602](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51602) Incorrect encoding when using IMAP "plain" authentication

In case mailbox login names allow multi-byte unicode characters, the login process would fail when using OX App Suite. This has been solved by applying the correct charset when performing the login procedure for mailboxes.

#### [51207](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51207) Error message shown if "default app" setting is empty

In cases where a users configuration was damaged and the default app "none" has been selected, subsequent logins led to error messages. We're now falling back to the global default app if the provided app cannot be found.

#### [50982](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50982) Empty "file count" for external cloud storage folders

Some external cloud storage providers do not provide the amount of files within a folder, in such cases OX App Suite would should "0" for any folder at that storage. A new internal capability per storage has been added to signal wether the storage does provide that information without executing expensive computation or storage access. According to that capability, OX App Suite UI will remove the "object count" indicator at folder details.

## Patch Release 3994 (2017-02-24)

### Shipped Components and Versions

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.3-rev16

### Fixed Bugs

#### [51859](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51859) Changed API behaviour leads to issues with file uploads

An earlier bugfix introduced a significant change to HTTP API behaviour, any change to the MIME-Type parameter has been rejected as a result. While OX clients were unaffected, this led to an incompatibility with third-party clients when using the "infostore" API for uploading and modifying files. We reduced the scope of the change to block MIME-Types that start with "multipart" instead, this should not affect the vast majority of use-cases for this API.

## Patch Release 3985 (2017-03-08)

* Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.3-rev17
* Open-Xchange AppSuite frontend 7.8.3-rev15

### Fixed Bugs

#### [51910](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51910) Huge amount of threads stops OX

Did some improvemnts to avoid a crashing OX. Utilize a user-scoped lock mechanism to avoid having a global lock that might affect unrelated threads unnecessarily. Avoid duplicate remote session look-up.

#### [51898](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51898) Mail with invalid MIME type attachment cannot be displayed

When you try to display or import an email which contains an attachment with an invalid MIME type as content type, an error was thrown.This has been fixed and it is possible to import and display the mail.

#### [51727](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51727) Mail icon stills appears in UI even though mail is not enabled

Caused by missing capability check for disabling and hiding.This has been fixed by adding the missing check.

#### [51572](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51572) Moving files with and without description not working in drive

Appsuite UI just redid the same operation.Solution: Appsuite UI checks which files caused conflicts and only tries to redo those.

#### [51570](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51570) Only one warning for copy multiple files with description in drive

Multiple response was not fully processed.This has been fixed by processing full array.

#### [51569](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51569) Primary mail address and aliases cannot be changed at the same time if the old primary mail address should be an alias

During the createuser command an alias for the primary mail account is already added. This alias is equal to the upper case notation used in the create command. The change command now tries to add the same alias but with only lower case letters. This isn't recognized and therefore the middleware tries to insert this alias to the db again which results in the duplicate entry error.Solution: Do a case independent check when comparing the old with the new aliases.

#### [51548](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51548) Moving files which already exist result in duplicate files with google drive

There was no name check performed for the move operations.This has been fixed by adding the name check to the move operation.

#### [51357](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51357) After last update to 7.8.3 no participants can be added in Scheduling with IE11

IE has problems with flexbox styles.This has been solved by changing styles to fix the problem.

#### [51222](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51222) Big text file load endless with the UI

The client request didn't get a response.With these changes the Viewer displays an error message if the file is too big to be loaded.

### Fixed Bugs

#### [51700](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51700) Guided tours showing for users even though the package was not installed

Document tours are contained in documents-ui package, existence of standard tours package was not checked there.This has been solved by adding check for existence of standard tours package, do not show tours automatically if missing, hide settings menu entry.

#### [51368](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51368) Bursts of WARN Messages: filemanagement.internal.ManagedFileManagementImpl ..Temporary file could not be deleted about 800-1000/day

Delete attempt does not check whether file is non-existing.This has been fixed by properly checking if attempt is made to delete a non-existing file changed logging appropriately.

#### [51357](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51357) No participants can be added in Scheduling with ie11 after an update

IE has problems with flexbox styles.This has been fixed by changing styles to fix the problem.

#### [51101](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51101) Showruntimestats -a errors: No suche cache: OXIMAPConCache

OXIMAPConCache is an obsolete JCS cache. The StatisticTools was querying the JCSCacheInformation for that particular non existing cache. The same applies for MailConnectionCache and SessionCache.This has been solved by removing the obsolete calls and corrected the error message.

#### [51091](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51091) Upload to external filestorage account folder does not abort if overquota and fails

Missing error handling for overquota in multiple file upload.This has been solved by checking error FLS-0024 and stop queue if this error appears. Also check for rate limit error. If one of those errors appear, the upload queue stops and removes all files from the queue.

#### [51053](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51053) Appointment invitations get duplicated by adding attachments

Deactivated Notification pool combined with multiple uploads of attachments result in a single notification mail for each attachment.Solution: Keep track of a batch of attachment uploads during the whole stack.

#### [50693](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50693) Content pane folder name not refreshed when renamed on external storage

Error handling is now done inside the apps. If errors with external storages (or other folder errors) appear and that folder is currently selected, the app will change to the default folder and reload the parent folder.

#### [50689](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50689) Possible to lock files in external storages when not supported

The 'locks' capability was not correct for some external storages.Changed behaviour: The file lock feature is disabled for every external storage. Lock does only work in the internal ox fileStore now.

#### [50414](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50414) Birthdays in the portal widget/sidepopup are sometimes a day off

Birthday calculation was slightly different in both views and apart from that even not correct for all cases.This has been solved by using the same code for both views and also using a correct approach.

#### [50039](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50039) Problem with folder rename of external storage providers

Dropbox identifies the folder through the path. New Files create all folders in their path by default. This is a special Dropbox behavior.This has been solved by checking for folder existence before storing a file and return default "folder does not exist exception".

#### [48361](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48361) Login not possible if folder limit is reached

This has been fixed by adding missing handling for this special case. Now the login is working and the user gets notified about this error.

## Patch Release 3925 (2017-01-26)

### Fixed Bugs

#### [51263](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51263) Missing function returned in case requested files could not be found

A earlier fix changed the response content when requesting a frontend related file. Instead of a function and a error message, just a error message was returned. As a result the web frontend could get stuck in case a file was not found. This has been solved by providing a similar response than earlier, just with obfuscated payload.

#### [51017](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51017) Munin error updating last-error in ox\_grizzly\_TCPNIOTransport

Last error value was not a simple signed integer.Check for "N/A", will return 0 instead of "N/A" with this fix and will only fix the problem for ox\_grizzly\_TCPNIOTransport.

#### [50997](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50997) Searching inside of sent mail folder always shows senders name in results column

This has been solved by adding special handling in find app.

#### [50991](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50991) Exception generating imap URI

A possible scheme/port information in "com.openexchange.mail.mailServer" or"com.openexchange.mail.transportServer" property was not properly handled.This has been solved by using a structured object for the global mail/transport server configuration setting to also apply protocol, port, etc. (if specified).

#### [50987](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50987) AutoStart is not working with io.ox/settings or portal

Settings is not a favorite app and is therefore ignored as autolaunch.This has been solved by adding a special case for settings. Settings will not appear in the dropdown but can be set by the provider as default autoStart app.

#### [50982](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50982) External Cloud Storage: number of Items in folder not displayed - '0' all the time

Some file storage implementations are not returning a file count.With this fix the filecount isnÂ´t dispalyed if the external storage returns no value for file count.

#### [50965](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50965) Restore compose application pop up not loading with 7.8.3 upgrade

Introduced new value for ox.serverConfig.persistence: "always". Only works with adjustment in custom bundles.

#### [50837](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50837) Birthday on 1.1.1970 not displayed

Timestamp for 1.1.1970 were interpreted as timestamp 0. Adjusted calculation from Birth Dates to solve this issue.

#### [50798](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50798) Renaming a root level folder which contains a Favorite Folder will lead to "Mailfolder not found on IMAP Server"

Missing checks if parent folders get renamed or removed.This has been solved by looking for rename or removal of parent folders. On rename: anticipate changed path and keep folder. On remove: immediately remove affected favorites. This doesn't work if triggered by another client.

#### [50714](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50714) OXtender synchronization fails with Couldn't determine extra fields in object with errors

The ical analysis of an external invitation delivers an json object "users" without sub fields, especially without confirmation. This was unexpected by USM and produced an error, which led to a general sync error with OLOX.Now the missing confirmation is accepted and initialized by USM with 0.

#### [50674](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50674) Deleting 2 Users at a time via SOAP results in a database deadlock

Possible database deadlock on concurrent delete attempts for users in the same context.Solution: Acquire a lock on user deletion to enforce enqueueing of concurrent delete calls.

#### [50258](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50258) Categories - select all in one of the tabs - info message that not all mails are selected is missing

Missing translations were added.

#### [50041](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50041) Moving files with description to external storage not working

Missing translations were added.

#### [50016](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50016) When composing an email, the signatures do not get refreshed, when adding initial/new one

#### [49937](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49937) Pasting multiple address result in single recipient

When taking over Email addresses from popular Office productivity suites by copy&paste, those were detected as single recipient. This happened since that software does not detect the kind of data but simply provides a string without delimiters. We've added support for more delimiters than comma and semicolon to work around this issue.

#### [49920](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49920) Quote get single lined when using drive mail

#### [49491](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49491) IMAP session Timeouts after switching the IMAP backends

Mutually exclusive access to shared instances of 'javax.mail.internet.MailDateFormat' prevent concurrent threads to parse IMAP INTERNALDATE/ENVELOPE fetch responses.Deal with possible locked shared instances of 'javax.mail.internet.MailDateFormat' to not block concurrent threads that attempt to parse IMAP INTERNALDATE/ENVELOPE fetch responses.

#### [49417](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49417) IMAP issue with empty x-originating-ip content

When sending NIL values for the "x-originating-ip" parameter, certain IMAP servers run into problems. This has been worked around to ensue no NIL values are sent by App Suite.

#### [49374](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49374) Bad organizer mail address when inviting through the calendar

Under certain circumstances, the organizer value was built from the user's display name when serializing to iCal.This has been fixed by using the user's e-mail address as organizer value if "primaryMail" is configured.

#### [49304](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49304) Crash on all Groupware Nodes

A newly introduced login handler stored an user attribute on each login operation, and the corresponding cache invalidation event was distributed remotely throughout the cluster, which lead to an increased number of unnecessary events.This has been updated by only updating user attribute if it actually was changed, skip cluster-wide invalidation.

#### [49265](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49265) Dropbox storage offers to add descriptions

When including Dropbox as a storage account, Drive did offer to add descriptions to files, which is unsupported by Dropbox. We're now adapting available Drive features in accordance to capabilities of those external storage providers.

#### [49259](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49259) Attachment corrupted when open in browser

Generic detection for possible XML content leads to accidental XML escaping.This has been fixed by excluding application content from XML escaping.

#### [49254](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49254) ShareService not starting up

In certain cases the ShareService did shut down during bundle startup, this has been handled to avoid signalling "stop" events during startup.

#### [49236](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49236) Huge amount of Mail folder could not be found on mail server messages for non-existing folders

The message for "Mail folder could not be found on mail server" were known, actually by design, but not expected to happen that often.The fix just excludes the inbox from the obfuscation, to reduce the amount of error messages.

#### [49231](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49231) Filter rules: From condition "is exactly" doesn't work on email addresses

To filter for email addresses in a more comfortable way "Sender address" were included as condition type.

Appsuite using a shared keypress handler for the numpad key and the 'a'. In combination with ctrl or another special key all messages get selected. A missing check in archive action allowed to archive a message with the numpad key.Now checking for 'a' key before archive.

#### [49207](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49207) Missing filenames for pasted screenshots

When passing a screenshot to mail compose, a attachment without filename got created. We now assign a default filename to such content to avoid compatibility issues.

#### [49196](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49196) Users can not be added to group

It was not possible to add an user to a group containing a space in the name and were created by the command line tool.This has been solved by using CHECK\_GROUP\_UID\_REGEXP property for group name validation during http-api calls.

#### [49141](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49141) Mail content only displayed on reply/forward

Mail content were not visible in all mails, actual mail content nested inside head element, which is removed for embedded display of foreign HTML content.Transfer non-head child elements to body to make the content visible.

#### [49103](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49103) No additional address books loaded in picker on mail compose

Too many contacts thus hitting the default limit of 10000 contacts.Now exclude the global address book from the picker to avoid an unresponsive dialog. New settings is: io.ox/contacts//picker/globalAddressBook=true/false.

#### [49091](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49091) Show requests for read receipts setting is not hidden when protected

#### [49074](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49074) Appointment cancellation mail loop with iOS

In rare cases the iOS Mail/Calendar clients decide to send out repeated cancellation mails. While the behaviour is triggered by the client we try to counter this behaviour by blocking cancellation mails at replies at OX App Suite when synchronizing.

#### [49057](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49057) Incorrect dates provided by WebDAV clients

When mounting Drive using WebDAV, some clients provide incorrect creation times for files. This was caused by a incompatible date format and has been fixed by providing RFC1123 dates instead.

#### [49055](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49055) FLD-0008 exception 'Folder 0 does not exist in context 1'

Appointment object is missing the action folder id.This has been solved by adding action folder id to appointment object.

#### [49007](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49007) Address picker shows inaccessible folders

When using the recipient picker for Email the second time while not having access to public and shared folders, those were shown as an option nonetheless. We fixed that by cleaning caches so the correct folders are provided as options.

#### [48949](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48949) Sometimes printing fails with "Drucken ist beim Starten des Druckvorgangs fehlgeschlagen." on Preview

Only affects calendar views as they are external, i.e. loaded from the server and was quite rare.This has been solved by implementing a delay to let the browser breathe. The delay is not really perceivable so it won't annoy end-users.

#### [48940](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48940) Autologout setting is not hidden when protected

Not all settings are implemented to configure via yml-File.Now this setting is supported for property- and yml-file.

#### [48928](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48928) Customization for contacts identity circle

#### [48927](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48927) Customization for contacts identity circle

In order keep the list at the address-book picker in sync with the Contacts app, identity circles can now be customized with regards to name initials. See SCR #3602.

#### [48883](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48883) logconf -l com.openexchange.usm does not filter for UID/CID

The logback filtering works in conjunction with the MDC properties, meaning that in order for a log filter to work, the userId, contextId and (optionally) sessionId have to be present in the MDC. In this case, the previous mentioned MDC properties were only applied upon a login request, hence the only DEBUG log entry that was visible in the log was that of the login request.This has been fixed by applying the MDC properties 'userId', 'contextId' and 'sessionId' (that is the USM session id and not OX session id) to the MDC when getting the USM session from the SessionStorage (which happens on every USM/EAS request).

#### [48851](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48851) Zero-minute reminders not respected in public calendars

When using public calendars and setting reminders to "0", this value is treated as "no reminder". This has been solved by signalling 0 as a legal value for appointments at such folders.

#### [48778](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48778) Contacts tab opens with ~20 Seconds Delay, Display-Errors after Tab Change Contacts to Calendar and back

The new user setting "Start in global address book" (default: true) conflicts with an extremely slow loading of address book.This has been solved by checking if the user setting is configurable. If not, the user doesn't see the setting. This fix neither accelerates the loading process nor does it avoid the invalid UI state if users go back and forth.

#### [48748](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48748) Distribution list view inconsistent, saving such a list does not work

The error is cause by two update operations on a contact off the distribution list. If a contact off the distribution list is within the address-book of the user, then the entry within the distribution list will reference this contact. In case the email address referenced by the distribution list is removed the entry within the distribution list is also updated (now empty). If then in a next step the contact is deleted the entry within the distribution list will be changed to a contact without a reference. In this case the mail address within the distribution list will be used, which is still be empty. In this case the distribution list is invalid because of this missing mail address.The exception message now tells the user which contact is causing the error and therefore he is able to solve the issue himself.

#### [48729](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48729) Archive folder visibility

In case users got provisioned with a specific name for the "Archive" folder, there was no way to remove that information afterwards. We've removed a sanitiy check for empty folder names and instead add "null" to the users mail configuration in case that folder shall be empty. As a result no folder will show up as "Archive" anymore. Note that using this functionality makes it mandatory to disable archive functionality as a capability for the user. Otherwise there will be inconsistencies and unexpected behaviour on the user-interface level, including re-creation of the "Archive" folder with its default values.

#### [48687](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48687) Carddav data with xD at the end of all lines

The underlying org.jdom library adjusts line endings during serialization, for inline vCards in multistatus responses this led to duplicated carriage return characters. While usually the receiving side is in charge to normalize line endings during parsing, one particular client is not able to do so.Solution: Serialize inline vCards in CARDDAV:address-data property as CDATA.

#### [48681](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48681) Mail not displayed correctly on Android

The mail contains two parts of type text/plain. The second part contains the greetings. USM handles only the first part for sending the mail in plain text format to the client (used by Android).With this fix USM concatenates all text/plain parts together.

#### [48663](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48663) No signature selected in settings after upgrade

Missing signature handling for update.Introduced central helper function which considers the different states, value of defaultSignature (compose/reply) is now used as new default value for 'defaultReplyForwardSignature'.

#### [48654](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48654) SpamExperts GUI page not displaying fully for SpamPanel

The container element of settings pages doesn't have a fixed height. This broke percentage-based height specification of its children.This has been fixed by using absolute positioning to make percentage-based heights work again.

#### [48631](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48631) Unexpected compression headers for SAML

When using HTTP redirect bindings for single logout responses, our implementation did expect zlib headers while raw gzip was returned. This has been solved by handling this kind of input.

#### [48630](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48630) Missing attachment preview for very special mails

When sending a mail to a mailing list and using a X.509 signature plus another attachment, that attachment could not get previewed in App Suite. This has been solved by avoiding to fetch ignorable parts of the mail.

#### [48629](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48629) Appointment jumps one day back if time changed more than 12h

Local date instead of internal utc date were used in one calculation.This has been fixed by sticking to utc-based calculations.

#### [48618](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48618) Portal tiles show hidden files

After displaying "hidden" files was disabled, they did still show up at the Drive portal tile of App Suite. This got solved by applying the correct filter to the tile as well.

#### [48598](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48598) Incomplete delete events sent when removing appointment series

When deleting a recurring appointment, the related event mechanism did distribute events which refer to the recurring appointment but did not contain any pointers to exceptions of that series. We're now sending more sophisticated objects that allow to gather references to exceptions of that recurring appointment.

#### [48495](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48495) New arriving mails are sorted somewhere into existing mails in list view

Sort handler was called before models were drawn and list were messed up.This has been solved by skipping sort when queue contains items and sort manually once the queue has been processed.

#### [48463](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48463) Multiple honorific prefixes are comma-separated

When using honorific prefixes, suffices or additional names at contacts, those details were transferred and serialized as individual attributes which led to display issues on some CardDAV clients. This has been solved by putting this information to single attribute.

#### [48438](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48438) Inconcistent folder order in Archive

The Archive folder did list subfolders in descending date order to make sure the most recent folders are on top. However this did conflict with certain use-cases and added inconsistency, therefor we switched to alphabetically ascending order for all folders except numeric ones.

#### [48394](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48394) DOS encoding for paths.perfMap

The file `paths.perfMap` was delivered with CRLF linebreaks, which of course does not make sense on Unix-style environments. We applied proper linebreaks again.

#### [48380](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48380) Unable to remove a directory in Drive

In case a directory contained a hidden subfolder without permissions to the deleting users, removal of that enclosing folder failed without a sufficient error message. We've extended the OX Drive protocol to handle this situation and make clients aware of the root cause.

#### [48364](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48364) Unable to save mail to "Sent" folder after sending

Getting the standard folders (e.g. for "Sent") failed in case a spam/ham folders where absent but expected. The code has been hardened to deal with situations like this, which may occur when using custom spam handler implementations or configuration.

#### [48349](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48349) 'AVERAGE\_USER\_SIZE' not found in file /opt/open-xchange/etc

The method getProperties was used.This was fixed by using getUserProperties.

#### [48348](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48348) Reporting issues with multiple registered servers

When having contexts spread across different middleware clusters but using the same database backends, the report client did not finish its execution. This has been solved by considering such configurations and general hardening of the report functionality in this regard.

#### [48344](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48344) User is not able to sent email to users on the same cluster after account is added as external

UseCountCopyTask used a wrong mapping object and tried to copy use counts of internal users and usercopy failed.This has been fixed by using the correct mapping object and skip use counts of internal users.

#### [48248](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48248) Unable to copy/move mail if target lacks flag compatibility

When copying or moving a mail from a mail backend that supports more IMAP user-flags than the target backend, an error was raised. This has been solved by checking existing flags and convert them in a compatible way.

#### [48243](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48243) Report clients stops for corrupt guest users

In case a guest user has a reference to a deleted user, running reports did not deliver any results. This has been solved by handling the absence of the referenced user.

#### [48242](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48242) Unable to delete appointment from cancelation mail

When using a CalDAV client like eMClient, some cancellation mails could not be used to delete the related appointment since their ID was missing. We solved that by avoiding a fallback to the "Publish" method when synchronizing.

#### [48205](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48205) Issues when switching SMTP-Auth

When configuring a external mail accounts SMTP credentials as "As incoming mail server" and changing this configuration to specific credentials, the old credentials were maintained. This has been fixed.

#### [48195](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48195) External appointment "You have confirmed this appointment", but is not accepted

New external appointments were displayed as accepted, but are nor accepted.Now new external appointments are not displayed as accepted.

#### [48133](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48133) Malformed mail causes warnings

In case a E-Mail contains illegal references to multiparts, such as attachments, a warning was raised at the log. To avoid log flooding the situation is being handled in the code without logging a verbose message.

#### [48118](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48118) Upsell I-Frame does not open in Firefox and IE

Click delegate on premium container didn't worked as expecting.This has been solved by using default select handler and call upsell method via custom trigger.

#### [48109](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48109) Special IMAP folders are re-set on first login

When defining special-use flags for IMAP folders, those were not considered when logging in for the first time. The behaviour has been made configurable by change #3524. Now we're considering those pre-defined special-use folders.

#### [48089](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48089) Weekend days were hardly readable

In case the current day is a Sunday, the date label was hardly readable since several shades of red were applied. This has been solved by correcting the priority of shades when displaying the calendar month view.

#### [48075](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48075) vCard export fails when missing references

#### [48047](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48047) Random OOM during parsing mail

This was caused by excessive creation of (sub-)strings while trying to re-parse a weird, but possible start tag segment.This has been fixed by improving detection of possibly contained HTML start tag and changed re-parse routine to avoid sub-string creation where possible.

#### [48006](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48006) IMAP ID is sent after login instead of before

"ID" command gets issued after login happened, breaking Dovecot's session tracing.This has been fixed by moving signalling IMAP session identifier through "ID" command to pre-login state.

#### [47992](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=47992) Mail content incorrectly displayed

As a side-effect of content sanitization certain invalid E-Mail structures, in this case broken tags were removed which led to follow-up issues when displaying the mail. We've made the sanitizer more flexible to avoid such false-positive cases.

#### [47967](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=47967) High CPU usage by Java process

An infinite loop while trying to determine a folder's reverse path to root folder caused the excessive creation of folder instances all kept in a wrapping java.util.ArrayList instance. It turned out that while loading the path for a folder from a subscribed external IMAP account, the special INBOX folder references itself as parent, consequently rendering the traversing loop infinite.This has been solved by introducing several safety checks (in case a folder references itself as parent) and guards to prevent from possible such an infinite loop when trying to determine a folder's path to root folder.

#### [47944](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=47944) Error when storing data to Swift backend

When creating a file on a Swift storage backend, the service might respond with HTTP Status 201 instead of 200 which was unexpected. This got fixed by handling this status as well.

#### [47932](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=47932) No free mailstore found causes configdb inconsitencies

When working with large distribution lists, usually more than 500 members, OX App Suite UI triggered a lot of unnecessary requests to get member information. Depending on the workflow and amount of members this could exceed the default rate-limit and effectively lock-out a user for several minutes. We have optimized which and how many calls are triggered when editing distribution lists to avoid this scenario.

#### [47720](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=47720) Missing check for filter rules capability

In case the mailfilter package is not installed, the frontend was missing a capability check and offered to create mailfilters based on existing E-Mail nonetheless. This was fixed by considering those capabilities.

#### [47417](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=47417) Listing large folders results in IE11 issues

When listing folders with more than 10.000 E-Mails and scrolling through them, IE11 did report script warnings. Those warnings were triggered by long-running JS actions.

#### [47378](https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=47378) Contact csv import: error message very vague

The csv parser is configured to be tolerant and accepts rows in csv files with columns sizes lower than the number of title columns. If a row does not contain enough columns it will add empty columns at the end of the row. If a column in the middle of the row is missing all other entries will be shifted to the left. This leads to an error for the distribution list column, because the importer uses the data of another column for this field.This has been fixed by adding a new parameter "line\_number" to the response result entry in case of an error, because it's impossible to improve the handling of defective csv files.
