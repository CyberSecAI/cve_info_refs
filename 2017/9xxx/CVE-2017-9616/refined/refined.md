{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by overly deep MP4 chunks, leading to stack exhaustion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack exhaustion due to excessive recursion depth while parsing MP4 files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by crashing the application due to stack overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a malformed MP4 file containing deeply nested chunks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application."
