Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9640:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a 'Path Traversal' vulnerability. Specifically, the `ManualCommand()` function in `ManualCommand.js` allows authenticated users to execute pre-defined commands. The `echo` command, in particular, can be abused to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the system, including directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the filename argument of the `echo` command.
*   **Unrestricted File Write:** The `echo` command does not restrict the target location, allowing the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations within the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can overwrite critical system files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   This can lead to manipulation of data and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, and requires an attacker with valid credentials. The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request.
*   The vulnerability is triggered via the manual command console in the management panel of the affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details**

*   The `ManualCommand()` function in the `ManualCommand.js` file is vulnerable
*   The `echo` command can be used with path traversal sequences to write to arbitrary files.
*   Example PoC request:
    ```
    GET /_common/servlet/lvl5/manualcommand?wbs=251&action=echo%20peend>..\touch.txt&id=7331 HTTP/1.1
    Host: TARGET
    ```

**Affected Products:**

*   ALC WebCTRL, SiteScan Web 6.1 and prior
*   ALC WebCTRL, i-Vu 6.0 and prior
*   ALC WebCTRL, i-Vu, SiteScan Web 5.5 and prior
*   ALC WebCTRL, i-Vu, SiteScan Web 5.2 and prior

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the provided patches or upgrade to the latest supported versions.
*   ALC applications should always be installed and maintained in accordance with the guidelines found here: <http://www.automatedlogic.com/Pages/Security.aspx>.
*   Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
*   Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
*   When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
