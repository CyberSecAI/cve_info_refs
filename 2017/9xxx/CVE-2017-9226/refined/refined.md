{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of octal numbers larger than 0xff within the `fetch_token()` and `fetch_token_in_cc()` functions during regular expression compilation in Oniguruma. Specifically, a malformed regex containing an octal number like '\\700' results in an invalid code point value greater than 0xff. This invalid value is then used in the `next_state_val()` function, leading to an out-of-bounds write, causing heap memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
       "Improper handling of octal escape sequences"
    ],
    "impact": "Heap memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behaviors.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a regular expression containing octal escape sequences with values larger than 0xff. This malformed regex is then compiled using the vulnerable oniguruma library.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted regular expression which is then compiled by the vulnerable software, thus the attacker needs control over the input to the regex engine."
