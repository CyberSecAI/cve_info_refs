# Version 4.7.5

[↑ Back to top](#wp--skip-link--target)

From the [WordPress 4.7.5 release post](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/05/wordpress-4-7-5/): WordPress versions 4.7.4 and earlier are affected by six security issues:

1. Insufficient redirect validation in the HTTP class. Reported by [Ronni Skansing](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/ronni-skansing-36143b65).
2. Improper handling of post meta data values in the XML-RPC API. Reported by [Sam Thomas](https://hackerone.com/jazzy2fives).
3. Lack of capability checks for post meta data in the XML-RPC API. Reported by [Ben Bidner](https://profiles.wordpress.org/vortfu/) of the WordPress Security Team.
4. A Cross Site Request Forgery (CRSF) vulnerability was discovered in the filesystem credentials dialog. Reported by [Yorick Koster](https://twitter.com/yorickkoster).
5. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered when attempting to upload very large files. Reported by [Ronni Skansing](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/ronni-skansing-36143b65).
6. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered related to the Customizer. Reported by [Weston Ruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) of the WordPress Security Team.

In addition to the security issues above, WordPress 4.7.5 contains four maintenance fixes to the 4.7 release series.

# WordPress 4.7.5 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 4.7.5 is now available. This is a **security release** for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

WordPress versions 4.7.4 and earlier are affected by six security issues:

1. Insufficient redirect validation in the HTTP class. Reported by [Ronni Skansing](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/ronni-skansing-36143b65).
2. Improper handling of post meta data values in the XML-RPC API. Reported by [Sam Thomas](https://hackerone.com/jazzy2fives).
3. Lack of capability checks for post meta data in the XML-RPC API. Reported by [Ben Bidner](https://profiles.wordpress.org/vortfu/) of the WordPress Security Team.
4. A Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  vulnerability was discovered in the filesystem credentials dialog. Reported by [Yorick Koster](https://twitter.com/yorickkoster).
5. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered when attempting to upload very large files. Reported by [Ronni Skansing](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/ronni-skansing-36143b65).
6. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered related to the Customizer. Reported by [Weston Ruter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/westonruter/) of the WordPress Security Team.

Thank you to the reporters of these issues for practicing [responsible disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/).

In addition to the security issues above, WordPress 4.7.5 contains 3 maintenance fixes to the 4.7 release series. For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.7.5) or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=4.7.5&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=keywords&order=priority).

[Download WordPress 4.7.5](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.7.5.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.7.5.

Package        : wordpress
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-8295 CVE-2017-9061 CVE-2017-9062 CVE-2017-9063
                 CVE-2017-9064 CVE-2017-9065
Debian Bug     : 862053 862816

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They would allow remote attackers to force password resets, and
perform various cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery
attacks.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u13.

For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 4.7.5+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
