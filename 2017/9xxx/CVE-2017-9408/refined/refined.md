Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `Object::initArray` function within the poppler library. Specifically, the function fails to properly free allocated memory when processing certain crafted PDF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: The `Object::initArray` function allocates memory but doesn't always free it, leading to a memory leak. This happens when processing specially crafted PDF files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service condition due to the uncontrolled consumption of memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted PDF File: An attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file that triggers the memory leak in `Object::initArray` when processed by the poppler library.
- The crafted PDF file needs to be opened/processed by an application using the vulnerable poppler library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted PDF to a user, who then processes it with a vulnerable application using poppler library.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report from freedesktop.org provides a detailed call stack of the memory leak, pinpointing the exact location of the issue within the source code. It also includes a testcase (malicious PDF).
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4079-1) mentions CVE-2017-9408 as one of several vulnerabilities fixed in a poppler security update.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201801-17) also lists CVE-2017-9408 as a vulnerability addressed in their poppler update.
- The Gentoo advisory notes that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF.
