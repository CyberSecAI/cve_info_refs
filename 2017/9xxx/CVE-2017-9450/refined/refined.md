Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9450:

**Root Cause:**

The `cfn-hup` daemon in the `aws-cfn-bootstrap` package creates world-writable directories due to an insecure default umask of 0 in the `python-daemon` library used by the daemon and the use of `os.makedirs` which defaults to 777 permissions. This allows any local user to write to the `metadata_db` file. The `cfn-hup` daemon then uses the Python `shelve` module to read this file which can lead to arbitrary code execution because `shelve` uses `pickle` which can execute arbitrary code when loading from untrusted sources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Permission Assignment (CWE-732):** The `cfn-hup` daemon creates directories with world-writable permissions (`rwxrwxrwx`).
2.  **Insecure Deserialization:** The `shelve` module, backed by `pickle`, is used to load data from the world-writable `metadata_db` file. Loading from untrusted sources allows for arbitrary code execution by crafting malicious data within that file.
3. **Insecure umask:** The `cfn-hup` daemon does not set a secure umask when creating files or directories, causing the daemon to create world-writable files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution as Root:** A non-privileged local attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Exploitation leads to full control of the affected system.
*   **Information Leak:** A local user can read the `metadata_db` file, which may contain sensitive information, including cleartext passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File Write:** An attacker with the ability to write files locally can overwrite the `metadata_db` file.
*   **Remote File Write (Indirect):** If a remotely accessible service has an arbitrary file write vulnerability, it could be used to write to the `metadata_db` file, leading to remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to write files.
*  **Ability to Write Files:** The attacker needs write access to `/var/lib/cfn-hup/data/metadata_db`.
* **No privilege escalation is required**: The vulnerable daemon runs as root.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `cfn-hup` daemon when it processes hooks, specifically when reading the `metadata_db` using `shelve`. This occurs every 15 minutes by default or upon daemon start.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit demonstrates how to create a malicious `metadata_db` file that executes arbitrary commands.
*   Affected AWS EC2 instances are those deployed with CloudFormation templates that include the `aws-cfn-bootstrap` package 1.4-15.9.amzn1 and at least one hook.
*   The issue was initially addressed by correcting the permissions on the affected directories. This was later deemed incomplete and the umask issue was fixed.
