Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9735:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a timing channel in the `Password.java` class within the Jetty web server. Specifically, the `Arrays.equals` method used for password comparison is susceptible to timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Timing Channel:** The use of `Arrays.equals` allows an attacker to potentially infer information about the correct password by measuring the time it takes for the password comparison to fail. Since the comparison short-circuits as soon as a mismatch is found, shorter times for incorrect password attempts reveal the position of the incorrect characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially obtain valid passwords by observing the timing differences when comparing passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely, as it exploits timing information observable from the network. The attacker needs to send password guesses to a Jetty server, and be able to measure the response time.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send authentication requests to the Jetty server with password attempts.
- The attacker needs to have a mechanism to measure the time taken by the server to respond to the authentication requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported in Jetty's issue tracker as issue #1556.
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `Arrays.equals` with a constant-time comparison method.
- The fix was backported to older Jetty versions.
- Debian assigned CVE-2017-9735 to this issue.
- This issue affects Jetty versions up to 9.4.x.
