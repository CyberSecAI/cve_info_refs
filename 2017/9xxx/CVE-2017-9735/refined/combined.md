Package        : jetty9
Version        : 9.2.30-0+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-9735 CVE-2018-12536 CVE-2019-10241 CVE-2019-10247
                 CVE-2020-27216
Debian Bug     : 864898 902774 928444

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in jetty, a Java servlet
engine and webserver. An attacker may reveal cryptographic credentials
such as passwords to a local user, disclose installation paths, hijack
user sessions or tamper with collocated webapps.

CVE-2017-9735

    Jetty is prone to a timing channel in util/security/Password.java,
    which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by
    observing elapsed times before rejection of incorrect passwords.

CVE-2018-12536

    On webapps deployed using default Error Handling, when an
    intentionally bad query arrives that doesn't match a dynamic
    url-pattern, and is eventually handled by the DefaultServlet's
    static file serving, the bad characters can trigger a
    java.nio.file.InvalidPathException which includes the full path to
    the base resource directory that the DefaultServlet and/or webapp
    is using. If this InvalidPathException is then handled by the
    default Error Handler, the InvalidPathException message is
    included in the error response, revealing the full server path to
    the requesting system.

CVE-2019-10241

    The server is vulnerable to XSS conditions if a remote client USES
    a specially formatted URL against the DefaultServlet or
    ResourceHandler that is configured for showing a Listing of
    directory contents.

CVE-2019-10247

    The server running on any OS and Jetty version combination will
    reveal the configured fully qualified directory base resource
    location on the output of the 404 error for not finding a Context
    that matches the requested path. The default server behavior on
    jetty-distribution and jetty-home will include at the end of the
    Handler tree a DefaultHandler, which is responsible for reporting
    this 404 error, it presents the various configured contexts as
    HTML for users to click through to. This produced HTML includes
    output that contains the configured fully qualified directory base
    resource location for each context.

CVE-2020-27216

    On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared
    between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe
    the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared
    temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the
    temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they
    will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to
    unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and
    JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of this temporary
    directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation
    vulnerability.

This update also includes several other bug fixes and
improvements. For more information please refer to the upstream
changelog file.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
9.2.30-0+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your jetty9 packages.

For the detailed security status of jetty9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jetty9>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Hi,

This is a pre-upload request to unblock jetty9/9.2.22-1. This update fixes
a timing attack in a class checking passwords (no CVE ID has been assigned yet)
and removes a broken symlink (#857217).

Note that Jetty 9.2.x is in maintenance mode and receives only critical fixes
from upstream, that's why I'm suggesting to upload a new version (it mostly
consists in the security fix anyway).

Thank you,

Emmanuel Bourg

Sorry that this didn't get picked up before the release.

From your comment above, I assume the plan is to get a newer upstream
version of Jetty into unstable soon? If so, then how we proceed with
fixing this in stretch depends on whether the Security Team plan to
handle it via a DSA; CCing them for an opinion.

Regards,

Adam

Sorry for the delay. No we marked the issue as no-dsa, and the fix
should preferably go in via a point release.

The CVE is [CVE-2017-9735](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9735).

Salvatore

Sorry for the delay here, looks like this was overlooked as not tagged
properly for a stable update.

The diff from the new version contains a lot of irrelevant changes,
which makes review more time consuming than it needs to be.  Please
prepare a targetted fix for #857217 instead.

Thanks,
Julien

## Description

[![@fredfeng](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/424181?u=349c39dc24b1381ee2414b200431d6b251776556&v=4&size=48)](/fredfeng)[fredfeng](https://github.com/fredfeng)opened [on May 16, 2017](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/issues/1556#issue-228940044)

Hi,

I found a timing channel in Password.java:

<https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.x/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/security/Password.java#L105>

By using Arrays.equals, it actually violates the "constant-time-implementation" discipline.

For more information about timing attack:

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
