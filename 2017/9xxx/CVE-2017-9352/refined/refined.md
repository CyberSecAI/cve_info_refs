Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9352:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Bazaar dissector in Wireshark contains a flaw that can cause it to enter an infinite loop due to how it handles certain malformed packets when parsing Bazaar protocol data units (PDUs).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite loop vulnerability in the Bazaar dissector.
- Improper handling of malformed Bazaar packets, specifically within the `get_bzr_pdu_len` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Excessive CPU resource consumption on the machine running Wireshark.
- Denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting malformed Bazaar packets onto the network.
- Convincing a user to open a malformed packet capture file (.pcap).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject network traffic or provide a malicious capture file.
- The user of the affected Wireshark version would need to analyze the malicious traffic or open a capture file with the malformed packets.
