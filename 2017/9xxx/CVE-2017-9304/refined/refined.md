Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-9304:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `_yr_re_emit()` function, which is part of the regular expression engine within the YARA library. The stack overflow occurs due to excessive recursion when processing a specially crafted regular expression.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded recursion: The `_yr_re_emit()` function calls itself recursively without proper limits on the depth of recursion.
- Lack of proper stack overflow protection: There's no mechanism to detect or prevent the stack from overflowing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the YARA process to crash due to a stack overflow, making the system unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted regular expression: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a malicious regular expression that causes excessive recursion. The provided payload in the Github issue, "yara_so_yr_re_emit.txt", demonstrates such a crafted regex.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious regular expression to the YARA engine. This could be achieved by:
    - Crafting YARA rules that use such regexes
    - Embedding malicious regexes in data scanned by YARA.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported using AddressSanitizer (ASAN), a memory error detector, which provides the exact call stack leading to the overflow in `re.c`.
- The fix (from the first content) involved moving regex limits to a separate header file limits.h. This change does not address the stack overflow itself, but rather makes the limit values more explicit and centralized.
