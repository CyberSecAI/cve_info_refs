Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9989:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within the `outputABC_STRING_INFO` function located in `util/outputtxt.c`. This occurs because the program attempts to allocate memory using `malloc`, and if `malloc` fails (due to the calculated `si->Size` being too large), it returns `NULL`. Subsequently, the program attempts to use `memset` with this `NULL` pointer, resulting in a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. After a failed memory allocation using `malloc` in `outputtxt.c`, the code proceeds to call `memset` on the returned NULL pointer.
*   **Insufficient Error Handling:** There is no check to verify if the memory allocation using `malloc` succeeded. The program doesn't handle the case where `malloc` returns `NULL`.
*   **Unvalidated Size Calculation:** A previous incorrect operation results in a large value for `si->size`, which leads to the failed `malloc`. This indicates that the size is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in the memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a crash in the application. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted input file that triggers the faulty memory allocation and subsequent NULL pointer dereference, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted File:** The attack vector is through a crafted input file that is processed by the vulnerable application. The crafted file manipulates the application's internal state, leading to the large `si->size` value that causes memory allocation failure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted SWF file to the vulnerable application (specifically the `listswf` tool in the `libming` library). No specific privileges seem to be necessary beyond this.
