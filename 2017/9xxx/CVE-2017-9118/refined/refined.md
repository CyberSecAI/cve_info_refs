  "CVE-2017-9118": {
    "description": "PHP through is vulnerable to an out of bounds access in the php_pcre.c:php_pcre_replace_impl() function. An attacker could exploit this by calling preg_replace() with crafted arguments.",
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds access in `php_pcre_replace_impl` function within php_pcre.c",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a segmentation fault and potentially other undefined behavior via crafted `preg_replace` arguments.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Calling the `preg_replace()` function with crafted arguments."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to call the `preg_replace()` function and control its arguments.",
    "more_info": "The vulnerability is triggered due to a lack of proper bounds checking when a large string is used as a replacement value in `preg_replace`, combined with the absence of memory limits. The issue arises when writing to the walkbuf using a loop which does not check the boundary of the buffer that walkbuf references and the data written is derived from the input."
