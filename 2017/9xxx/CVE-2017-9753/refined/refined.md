The provided content is related to CVE-2017-9753.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by two issues in the versados parser within binutils:
1.  The `versados_mkobject` function did not properly zero the allocated `tdata` structure.
2.  The `process_otr` function did not validate the offset in the OTR (Object Transfer Record) structure, leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uninitialized memory: The `tdata` structure wasn't properly initialized, leading to potential issues.
- Out-of-bounds read: An invalid offset in the OTR structure could cause the parser to read memory outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is a segmentation fault (SEGV) which results in a crash of the `objdump` utility. This can cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when `objdump` attempts to disassemble a crafted VersaDOS binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted VersaDOS binary to the `objdump` utility as input.
