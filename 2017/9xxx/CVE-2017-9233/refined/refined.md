      "description": "External entity infinite loop DoS [1]",
      "root_cause": "The parser failed to properly recognize an invalid case within a DTD, specifically an ordinary element inside an external parameter entity.  The parser recognized \"<e\" as the start of a valid element but didn't recognize it as invalid in the context of a DTD. This caused the parser to attempt to tokenize the same string repeatedly.",
