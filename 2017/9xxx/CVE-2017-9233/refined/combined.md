# Expat, Release 2.6.4

This is Expat, a C99 library for parsing
[XML 1.0 Fourth Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/), started by
[James Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clark_%28programmer%29) in 1997.
Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser. This means that you register
handlers with the parser before starting the parse. These handlers
are called when the parser discovers the associated structures in the
document being parsed. A start tag is an example of the kind of
structures for which you may register handlers.

Expat supports the following C99 compilers:

* GNU GCC >=4.5 (for use from C) or GNU GCC >=4.8.1 (for use from C++)
* LLVM Clang >=3.5
* Microsoft Visual Studio >=16.0/2019 (rolling `${today} minus 5 years`)

Windows users can use the
[`expat-win32bin-*.*.*.{exe,zip}` download](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/releases),
which includes both pre-compiled libraries and executables, and source code for
developers.

Expat is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).
You may copy, distribute, and modify it under the terms of the License
contained in the file
[`COPYING`](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/master/expat/COPYING)
distributed with this package.
This license is the same as the MIT/X Consortium license.

## Using libexpat in your CMake-Based Project

There are three documented ways of using libexpat with CMake:

### a) `find_package` with Module Mode

This approach leverages CMake's own [module `FindEXPAT`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindEXPAT.html).

Notice the *uppercase* `EXPAT` in the following example:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

project(hello VERSION 1.0.0)

find_package(EXPAT 2.2.8 MODULE REQUIRED)

add_executable(hello
    hello.c
)

target_link_libraries(hello PUBLIC EXPAT::EXPAT)
```

### b) `find_package` with Config Mode

This approach requires files from…

* libexpat >=2.2.8 where packaging uses the CMake build system
  or
* libexpat >=2.3.0 where packaging uses the GNU Autotools build system
  on Linux
  or
* libexpat >=2.4.0 where packaging uses the GNU Autotools build system
  on macOS or MinGW.

Notice the *lowercase* `expat` in the following example:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

project(hello VERSION 1.0.0)

find_package(expat 2.2.8 CONFIG REQUIRED char dtd ns)

add_executable(hello
    hello.c
)

target_link_libraries(hello PUBLIC expat::expat)
```

### c) The `FetchContent` module

This approach — as demonstrated below — requires CMake >=3.18 for both the
[`FetchContent` module](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html)
and its support for the `SOURCE_SUBDIR` option to be available.

Please note that:

* Use of the `FetchContent` module with *non-release* SHA1s or `master`
  of libexpat is neither advised nor considered officially supported.
* Pinning to a specific commit is great for robust CI.
* Pinning to a specific commit needs updating every time there is a new
  release of libexpat — either manually or through automation —,
  to not miss out on libexpat security updates.

For an example that pulls in libexpat via Git:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

include(FetchContent)

project(hello VERSION 1.0.0)

FetchContent_Declare(
    expat
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/
    GIT_TAG        000000000_GIT_COMMIT_SHA1_HERE_000000000  # i.e. Git tag R_0_Y_Z
    SOURCE_SUBDIR  expat/
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(expat)

add_executable(hello
    hello.c
)

target_link_libraries(hello PUBLIC expat)
```

## Building from a Git Clone

If you are building Expat from a check-out from the
[Git repository](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/),
you need to run a script that generates the configure script using the
GNU autoconf and libtool tools. To do this, you need to have
autoconf 2.58 or newer. Run the script like this:

```
./buildconf.sh
```

Once this has been done, follow the same instructions as for building
from a source distribution.

## Building from a Source Distribution

### a) Building with the configure script (i.e. GNU Autotools)

To build Expat from a source distribution, you first run the
configuration shell script in the top level distribution directory:

```
./configure
```

There are many options which you may provide to configure (which you
can discover by running configure with the `--help` option). But the
one of most interest is the one that sets the installation directory.
By default, the configure script will set things up to install
libexpat into `/usr/local/lib`, `expat.h` into `/usr/local/include`, and
`xmlwf` into `/usr/local/bin`. If, for example, you'd prefer to install
into `/home/me/mystuff/lib`, `/home/me/mystuff/include`, and
`/home/me/mystuff/bin`, you can tell `configure` about that with:

```
./configure --prefix=/home/me/mystuff
```

Another interesting option is to enable 64-bit integer support for
line and column numbers and the over-all byte index:

```
./configure CPPFLAGS=-DXML_LARGE_SIZE
```

However, such a modification would be a breaking change to the ABI
and is therefore not recommended for general use — e.g. as part of
a Linux distribution — but rather for builds with special requirements.

After running the configure script, the `make` command will build
things and `make install` will install things into their proper
location. Have a look at the `Makefile` to learn about additional
`make` options. Note that you need to have write permission into
the directories into which things will be installed.

If you are interested in building Expat to provide document
information in UTF-16 encoding rather than the default UTF-8, follow
these instructions (after having run `make distclean`).
Please note that we configure with `--without-xmlwf` as xmlwf does not
support this mode of compilation (yet):

1. Mass-patch `Makefile.am` files to use `libexpatw.la` for a library name:

   `find . -name Makefile.am -exec sed -e 's,libexpat\.la,libexpatw.la,' -e 's,libexpat_la,libexpatw_la,' -i.bak {} +`
2. Run `automake` to re-write `Makefile.in` files:

   `automake`
3. For UTF-16 output as unsigned short (and version/error strings as char),
   run:

   `./configure CPPFLAGS=-DXML_UNICODE --without-xmlwf`

   For UTF-16 output as `wchar_t` (incl. version/error strings), run:

   `./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2 -fshort-wchar" CPPFLAGS=-DXML_UNICODE_WCHAR_T --without-xmlwf`

   Note: The latter requires libc compiled with `-fshort-wchar`, as well.
4. Run `make` (which excludes xmlwf).
5. Run `make install` (again, excludes xmlwf).

Using `DESTDIR` is supported. It works as follows:

```
make install DESTDIR=/path/to/image
```

overrides the in-makefile set `DESTDIR`, because variable-setting priority is

1. commandline
2. in-makefile
3. environment

Note: This only applies to the Expat library itself, building UTF-16 versions
of xmlwf and the tests is currently not supported.

When using Expat with a project using autoconf for configuration, you
can use the probing macro in `conftools/expat.m4` to determine how to
include Expat. See the comments at the top of that file for more
information.

A reference manual is available in the file `doc/reference.html` in this
distribution.

### b) Building with CMake

The CMake build system is still *experimental* and may replace the primary
build system based on GNU Autotools at some point when it is ready.

#### Available Options

For an idea of the available (non-advanced) options for building with CMake:

```
# rm -f CMakeCache.txt ; cmake -D_EXPAT_HELP=ON -LH . | grep -B1 ':.*=' | sed 's,^--$,,'
// Choose the type of build, options are: None Debug Release RelWithDebInfo MinSizeRel ...
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=

// Character type to use (char|ushort|wchar_t) [default=char]
EXPAT_CHAR_TYPE:STRING=char

// Install expat files in cmake install target
EXPAT_ENABLE_INSTALL:BOOL=ON

// Use /MT flag (static CRT) when compiling in MSVC
EXPAT_MSVC_STATIC_CRT:BOOL=OFF

// Build fuzzers via OSS-Fuzz for the expat library
EXPAT_OSSFUZZ_BUILD:BOOL=OFF

// Build a shared expat library
EXPAT_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON

// Treat all compiler warnings as errors
EXPAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS:BOOL=OFF

// Make use of getrandom function (ON|OFF|AUTO) [default=AUTO]
EXPAT_WITH_GETRANDOM:STRING=AUTO

// Utilize libbsd (for arc4random_buf)
EXPAT_WITH_LIBBSD:BOOL=OFF

// Make use of syscall SYS_getrandom (ON|OFF|AUTO) [default=AUTO]
EXPAT_WITH_SYS_GETRANDOM:STRING=AUTO
```

# [CVE-2017-9233](../../doc/cve-2017-9233/)

*Written by Rhodri James*; article also available at
[kynesim.blogspot.co.uk](https://kynesim.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/external-entity-vulnerability-in-expat.html).

# External Entity Vulnerability in Expat 2.2.0 And Earlier

I'm in the intriguing position of being employed to work on a free
software project
by [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). I'm
expanding the test coverage of the Expat library under the eagle eye
of maintainer Sebastian Pipping, which is an excellent way of
discovering how the brilliant, twisted and almost entirely
undocumented internals work. (There will be articles. Many articles.)

One thing you expect to come across when writing tests is the
occasional bug. I came across a serious one in the parsing of
external parameter entities. CVE-2017-9233 (to give it its formal
identification) says that bad XML in an external entity will cause the
parser to go into an infinite loop and never return control to the
application.

For those of you who haven't been saturated in XML terminology for the
last however long, an example is in order. Suppose you have the
following trivial piece of XML:

```
<!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM "http://example.com/level1.dtd">
<doc/>

```

And the DTD `level1.dtd` that it reads:

```
<!ELEMENT doc EMPTY>
<!ENTITY % e SYSTEM "http://example.com/level2.ent">
%e;

```

And the external entity definition in yet another resource, `level2.ent`:

```
<!ELEMENT el EMPTY>
<el/>

```

Now a quick riffle through the XML standards will tell you that
ordinary elements such as `<el>` aren't allowed in DTDs. All you can
legally use are the DTD declarations `<!ELEMENT>`, `<!ATTLIST>`,
`<!ENTITY>` and `<!NOTATION>`. When our entity `%e` in level.dtd gets
substituted in, it will put the `<el/>` element straight into the DTD,
leaving us with a malformed DTD. The parser should detect this and
reject the whole shebang.

What actually happened is hard to follow in the source code. (*Many*
articles.) When parsing reached the 'e' of `<el/>`, the tokenizer
recognised it as a valid start of an ordinary element (which is true)
and returned the appropriate value, `XML_TOK_INSTANCE_START`.

The calling code knew how to recognise the limited number of tokens
that are legal and most of the tokens that aren't legal in a DTD, but
unfortunately it missed this specific case. Without any better
instructions from its decision logic, the code assumed that it had
found something valid and tried tokenising again, in case there was
more text to be parsed.

It did this expecting that its internal pointers were updated to point
to that unparsed text. That would have been true if it had dealt with
something legal, but since "<e" isn't a legal part of a DTD the
pointers had been left alone. The tokenizer therefore saw "<e" again,
returned `XML_TOK_INSTANCE_START` again, and the whole thing repeated
until the application was killed.

In brief:

* The lowest levels of the parser recognise "<e" as starting an
  element.
* The next level up correctly doesn't recognise it as a valid case
* ...but also fails to recognise it as an invalid case.
* The parser assumes it was successful and tries again *on the same
  string.*

## Why Do I Care?

"How does this affect me?" you may well ask. "I don't use Expat. I
don't even write in C. How can I possibly be affected?" The answer
is, you may well be using Expat unknowingly. There are wrapper
libraries for Python, Java and many other languages for Expat. Many
other
[application and libraries](https://libexpat.github.io/doc/users/)
(particularly C and C++ libraries like Poco, libDOM or libwww) use
Expat under the hood.

The libraries often enable external entity parsing, which does
potentially allow this bug to bite your application. Some of them
will, or used to, download the URIs for you, which is a serious
problem. Some of the applications are just parsing local
configuration files, but even those might follow a DTD if one was
inserted into the configuration file somehow. Other applications
explicitly use external DTDs, leaving you vulnerable if those sites
are compromised or malicious.

In short, it's entirely possible for you to be using Expat and not
know it.

## What Should I Do?

First and most obviously, upgrade. The current version of libexpat
has patched this bug, and a few other things; read the change log for
details.

The other thing you should always do is consider how you use your XML
parser. I am not a security expert by any stretch of the imagination,
but even I know not to download arbitrary URIs, for example. Reading
"https://www.w3c.org/xml/fluffy.ent" is probably safe; reading
"http://evil.haxx0rs.org/xml/i-pwn-u.dtd" probably isn't. You should
check that any library you use doesn't automatically download
arbitrary URIs for you, and you should be careful about what URIs you
do allow to be downloaded.

## Conclusions

If you want a moral from this article: always test. Murphy's Law
ensures there will always be bugs in your code, and you should make at
least some effort to find them before they annoy other people. And if
by chance you should be one of those people annoyed by a bug, let the
author know. He or she will usually be glad for the feedback and want
it fixed as much as you do!

Package        : expat
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9063 CVE-2017-9233

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Expat, an XML parsing C
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2016-9063

    Gustavo Grieco discovered an integer overflow flaw during parsing of
    XML. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
    of service against an application using the Expat library.

CVE-2017-9233

    Rhodri James discovered an infinite loop vulnerability within the
    entityValueInitProcessor() function while parsing malformed XML
    in an external entity. An attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to cause a denial of service against an application using
    the Expat library.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.1.0-6+deb8u4.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.0-2+deb9u1. For the stable distribution (stretch),
CVE-2016-9063 was already fixed before the initial release.

For the testing distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.1-1 or earlier version.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.1-1 or earlier version.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Release 2.6.0 Tue February 6 2024 Security fixes: #789 #814 CVE-2023-52425 -- Fix quadratic runtime issues with big tokens that can cause denial of service, in partial where dealing with compressed XML input. Applications that parsed a document in one go -- a single call to functions XML\_Parse or XML\_ParseBuffer -- were not affected. The smaller the chunks/buffers you use for parsing previously, the bigger the problem prior to the fix. Backporters should be careful to no omit parts of pull request #789 and to include earlier pull request #771, in order to not break the fix. #777 CVE-2023-52426 -- Fix billion laughs attacks for users compiling \*without\* XML\_DTD defined (which is not common). Users with XML\_DTD defined have been protected since Expat >=2.4.0 (and that was CVE-2013-0340 back then).
 Bug fixes: #753 Fix parse-size-dependent "invalid token" error for external entities that start with a byte order mark #780 Fix NULL pointer dereference in setContext via XML\_ExternalEntityParserCreate for compilation with XML\_DTD undefined #812 #813 Protect against closing entities out of order

Release 2.4.0 Sun May 23 2021 Security fixes: #34 #466 #484 CVE-2013-0340/CWE-776 -- Protect against billion laughs attacks (denial-of-service; flavors targeting CPU time or RAM or both, leveraging general entities or parameter entities or both) by tracking and limiting the input amplification factor (<amplification> := (<direct> + <indirect>) / <direct>). By conservative default, amplification up to a factor of 100.0 is tolerated and rejection only starts after 8 MiB of output bytes (=<direct> + <indirect>) have been processed. The fix adds the following to the API: - A new error code XML\_ERROR\_AMPLIFICATION\_LIMIT\_BREACH to signals this specific condition. - Two new API functions .. - XML\_SetBillionLaughsAttackProtectionMaximumAmplification and - XML\_SetBillionLaughsAttackProtectionActivationThreshold .. to further tighten billion laughs protection parameters when desired. Please see file "doc/reference.html" for details. If you ever need to increase the defaults for non-attack XML payload, please file a bug report with libexpat. - Two new XML\_FEATURE\_\* constants .. - that can be queried using the XML\_GetFeatureList function, and - that are shown in "xmlwf -v" output. - Two new environment variable switches .. - EXPAT\_ACCOUNTING\_DEBUG=(0|1|2|3) and - EXPAT\_ENTITY\_DEBUG=(0|1) .. for runtime debugging of accounting and entity processing. Specific behavior of these values may change in the future. - Two new command line arguments "-a FACTOR" and "-b BYTES" for xmlwf to further tighten billion laughs protection parameters when desired. If you ever need to increase the defaults for non-attack XML payload, please file a bug report with libexpat.

### [External Entity Vulnerability in Expat 2.2.0 And Earlier](https://kynesim.blogspot.com/2017/06/external-entity-vulnerability-in-expat.html)

##

(First posted on the [LibExpat Documentation Site](https://libexpat.github.io/doc/cve-2017-9233/))

I'm in the intriguing position of being employed to work on a free software project by [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).  I'm expanding the test coverage of the Expat library under the eagle eye of maintainer Sebastian Pipping, which is an excellent way of discovering how the brilliant, twisted and almost entirely undocumented internals work.  (There will be articles.  Many articles.)

One thing you expect to come across when writing tests is the occasional bug.  I came across a serious one in the parsing of external parameter entities.  CVE-2017-9233 (to give it its formal identification) says that bad XML in an external entity will cause the parser to go into an infinite loop and never return control to the application.

For those of you who haven't been saturated in XML terminology for the last however long, an example is in order.  Suppose you have the following trivial piece of XML:

```
    <!DOCTYPE doc SYSTEM "http://example.com/level1.dtd">
    <doc/>

```

And the DTD level1.dtd that it reads:

```
    <!ELEMENT doc EMPTY>
    <!ENTITY % e SYSTEM "http://example.com/level2.ent">
    %e;

```

And the external entity definition in yet another resource, level2.ent:

```
    <!ELEMENT el EMPTY>
    <el/>

```

Now a quick riffle through the XML standards will tell you that ordinary elements such as <el> aren't allowed in DTDs.  All you can legally use are the DTD declarations <!ELEMENT>, <!ATTLIST>, <!ENTITY> and <!NOTATION>.  When our entity %e in level.dtd gets substituted in, it will put the <el/> element straight into the DTD, leaving us with a malformed DTD.  The parser should detect this and reject the whole shebang.

What actually happened is hard to follow in the source code.  (*Many* articles.)  When parsing reached the 'e' of <el/>, the tokenizer recognised it as a valid start of an ordinary element (which is true) and returned the appropriate value, XML\_TOK\_INSTANCE\_START.

The calling code knew how to recognise the limited number of tokens that are legal and most of the tokens that aren't legal in a DTD, but unfortunately it missed this specific case.  Without any better instructions from its decision logic, the code assumed that it had found something valid and tried tokenising again, in case there was more text to be parsed.

It did this expecting that its internal pointers were updated to point to that unparsed text.  That would have been true if it had dealt with something legal, but since "<e" isn't a legal part of a DTD the pointers had been left alone.  The tokenizer therefore saw "<e" again, returned XML\_TOK\_INSTANCE\_START again, and the whole thing repeated until the application was killed.

In brief:

* The lowest levels of the parser recognise "<e" as starting an element.
* The next level up correctly doesn't recognise it as a valid case
* ...but also fails to recognise it as an invalid case.
* The parser assumes it was successful and tries again *on the same string.*

### Why Do I Care?

"How does this affect me?" you may well ask.  "I don't use Expat.  I don't even write in C.  How can I possibly be affected?"  The answer is, you may well be using Expat unknowingly.  There are wrapper libraries for Python, Java and many other languages for Expat.  Many other [application and libraries](https://libexpat.github.io/doc/users) (particularly C and C++ libraries like Poco, libDOM or libwww) use Expat under the hood.

The libraries often enable external entity parsing, which does potentially allow this bug to bite your application.  Some of them will, or used to, download the URIs for you, which is a serious problem.  Some of the applications are just parsing local configuration files, but even those might follow a DTD if one was

inserted into the configuration file somehow.  Other applications explicitly use external DTDs, leaving you vulnerable if those sites are compromised or malicious.

In short, it's entirely possible for you to be using Expat and not know it.

### What Should I Do?

First and most obviously, upgrade.  The current version of libexpat has patched this bug, and a few other things; read the change log for details.

The other thing you should always do is consider how you use your XML parser.  I am not a security expert by any stretch of the imagination, but even I know not to download arbitrary URIs, for example.  Reading "https://www.w3c.org/xml/fluffy.ent" is probably safe; reading "http://evil.haxx0rs.org/xml/i-pwn-u.dtd" probably isn't.  You should check that any library you use doesn't automatically download arbitrary URIs for you, and you should be careful about what URIs you do allow to be downloaded.

### Conclusions

If you want a moral from this article: always test.  Murphy's Law ensures there will always be bugs in your code, and you should make at least some effort to find them before they annoy other people.  And if by chance you should be one of those people annoyed by a bug, let the author know.  He or she will usually be glad for the feedback and want it fixed as much as you do!
