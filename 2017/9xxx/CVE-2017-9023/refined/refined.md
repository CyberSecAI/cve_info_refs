{
  "CVE-2017-9023": {
    "Description": "ASN.1 CHOICE types are not correctly handled by the ASN.1 parser when parsing X.509 certificates with extensions that use such types. This could lead to infinite looping of the thread parsing a specifically crafted certificate.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect handling of ASN.1 CHOICE types in the ASN.1 parser, specifically when parsing X.509 certificates with extensions using these types.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The ASN.1 parser does not correctly handle CHOICE types.",
      "The parser does not enforce that exactly one sub-element is parsed when handling CHOICE types, leading to a possible infinite loop.",
        "The x509 plugin incorrectly defined a parsing rule with a loop, where there was none defined."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to infinite loop during X.509 certificate parsing.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A specifically crafted X.509 certificate with extensions that use ASN.1 CHOICE types.",
       "An X.509 certificate with invalid data in the nameConstraints extension."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send a crafted X.509 certificate to the vulnerable system.",
        "The attacker would need to be able to initiate an IPsec connection to a vulnerable server, presenting the malicious certificate during the IKE handshake"
    ],
       "Affected": [
        "All strongSwan versions up to and including 5.5.2."
      ]
