The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9546.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input sanitization when saving a page revision. Specifically, the application allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML into a page revision, which is then executed when the revision is loaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability through the injection of malicious HTML in page revisions.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization
- Improper handling of user input when saving page revisions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By injecting a specific payload, it generates a wrong report and prevents further saving of revisions.
- Potential information disclosure by leaking source code.
- Arbitrary code execution on the client-side browser of a user that loads the malicious page revision.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the administration panel, specifically while editing a page and saving a new revision.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs administrator-level access to the BigTree CMS system.
- The attacker must be able to edit pages and create revisions.
