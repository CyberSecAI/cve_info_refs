This content provides information on CVE-2017-9596, as it is listed as one of the affected applications in the provided list.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. It is suspected this vulnerability is derived from third-party code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation. This allows for a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can intercept the banking username and password of users logging into the affected applications.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be carried out wirelessly by an attacker within close proximity (50-100 feet) of the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack (e.g. using tools like `bettercap`).
- The attacker does not require any special modifications or prerequisites to perform the attack.
- The attacker needs to enable HTTPS sniffing and use the “POST” request parser in order to capture the credentials.
