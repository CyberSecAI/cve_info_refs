**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21582

I have been fuzzing objdump with American Fuzzy Lop and AddressSanitizer.

Please find attached the minimized file causing the issue ("Input") and the
ASAN report log ("Output"). Below is the reduced stacktrace with links to the
corresponding source lines on a GitHub mirror.

The command I used was `objdump -D <file>`.

Let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Please find attached the minimized file causing the issue ("Input") and the ASAN report log ("Output"). Below is the reduced stacktrace with links to the corresponding source lines on a GitHub mirror.  The command I used was `objdump -D <file>`.  Let me know if there is any additional information I can provide.  --  Input: ef51bcdcaae667058b002f94b5dafd05.12926af7cc4fab77f87a3ec70a329100.min Output: ef51bcdcaae667058b002f94b5dafd05.12926af7cc4fab77f87a3ec70a329100.txt  Error in "ieee_object_p": stack-buffer-overflow   in ieee_object_p at bfd/ieee.c:1985     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/bfd/ieee.c#L1985>)   in bfd_check_format_matches at bfd/format.c:311     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/bfd/format.c#L311>)   in display_object_bfd at binutils/objdump.c:3602     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L3602>)   in display_any_bfd at binutils/objdump.c:3693     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L3693>)   in display_file at binutils/objdump.c:3714     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L3714>)   in main at binutils/objdump.c:4016     (see <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/561bf3e950e410fbcac06523d43039f1f58150ca/binutils/objdump.c#L4016>) ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=21582#c1)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 17:53:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10114](attachment.cgi?id=10114 "testcase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10114&action=edit "testcase") testcase ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=21582#c2)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 17:53:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10115](attachment.cgi?id=10115 "report") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10115&action=edit "report") report ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=21582#c3)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-13 22:36:49 UTC  ``` Additional Information: The command used was `objdump -D <file>`.

Although I can reproduce the problem, it goes away   whenever I make changes to the sources, including just adding comments!  I   suspect a compiler bug, but I cannot prove it at the moment.    Are you able to test out patches and see if they make a difference ?  If so   please could you try out the uploaded patch which might make a difference.   For me, the bug goes away, but I cannot tell if I have really fixed the   problem, or if there is still some kind of stack corruption going on.  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=21582#c5)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-14 14:52:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to Nick Clifton from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=21582#c4)) >   Are you able to test out patches and see if they make a difference ?

I tried your patch with both the raw and the minimized testcases; it seems not to crash anymore. I have started an instance of AFL in "crash exploration" mode in order to generate more diverse testcases. I will report back in a few hours.  Thanks a lot for all your bug fixes, you're doing god's work! :-) ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=21582#c6)  Alexandre Adamski    2017-06-15 09:55:33 UTC  ``` Sounds like it's fixed for me! ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=21582#c7)  Sourceware Commits    2017-06-15 11:45:37 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Nick Clifton <nickc@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=63634bb4a107877dd08b6282e28e11cfd1a1649e>  commit 63634bb4a107877dd08b6282e28e11cfd1a1649e Author: Nick Clifton <nickc@redhat.com> Date:   Thu Jun 15 12:44:23 2017 +0100      Avoid a possible compiler bug by using a static buffer instead of a stack local buffer.
