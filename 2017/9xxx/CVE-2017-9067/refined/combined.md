### @opengeek **[opengeek](/opengeek)** commented [Apr 19, 2017](#issue-222764455)

### What does it do?

This commit improves the LFI protections throughout the core to remove any sequence of 2 or more `.` characters regardless of the path delimiter that precedes or follows it.

### Why is it needed?

The existing protections would not work on Windows platforms with backslash path delimiters.

### Related issue(s)/PR(s)
