  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The existing Local File Inclusion (LFI) protections in the MODX Revolution CMS were insufficient, particularly on Windows systems using backslashes as path delimiters. These protections failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for directory traversal attacks using sequences of '..' characters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Failure to handle different path delimiters (backslash vs. forward slash)",
      "Vulnerable to directory traversal attacks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to include and execute arbitrary local files on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the web application and the underlying system.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the setup action parameter to inject directory traversal sequences"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send crafted requests to the MODX Revolution CMS."
