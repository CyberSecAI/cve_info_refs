Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on filename extensions and demuxer names when handling HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) in Libav/FFmpeg. Specifically, the HLS implementation didn't properly validate the file extensions of local files, allowing an attacker to potentially access arbitrary files on the local file system via crafted playlist data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of file extensions for local files accessed via HLS. The system was not restricting access to only common multimedia file extensions.
*   **Information Leak:** This insufficient validation creates a vulnerability that can be exploited to leak information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files and symlinks present on the local system by crafting malicious HLS playlist data. This could expose sensitive data such as private keys or passwords if those files have multimedia extensions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Playlist Data:** An attacker would need to provide crafted HLS playlist data to trigger the vulnerability. This crafted data would specify file paths, which, without proper extension validation, would allow for arbitrary file access.
*   **Local File Access:** The attack is specifically related to the handling of local files within the HLS implementation. Remote addresses on the LAN are not affected by this particular fix.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide crafted HLS data:** An attacker must be able to supply malicious HLS playlist data to the vulnerable system, likely through a manipulated media file or stream.
*   **Local file path knowledge:** In order to read particular files, the attacker would need to know (or guess) the file paths and extensions that exist on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix implemented in the provided commit `189ff4219644532bdfa7bab28dfedaee4d6d4021` adds a check to ensure that local files accessed via HLS have a common multimedia file extension (configurable via the `allowed_extensions` option).
*   The issue was reported by Thierry Foucu, with credit to Emil Lerner and Pavel Cheremushkin for finding it.
*   The provided commit `a5d849b149ca67ced2d271dc84db0bc95a548abb` is related to preventing another information leak exploit by limiting formats in gab2 to srt and ass/ssa.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3957-1) and the Debian LTS advisory (DLA 1630-1) confirm the presence of CVE-2017-9993 and state that this vulnerability allowed reading arbitrary files using crafted playlist data.
