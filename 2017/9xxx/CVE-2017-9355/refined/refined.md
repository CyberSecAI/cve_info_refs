Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-9355

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML data within the Subsonic media server's playlist import feature. Specifically, it fails to properly sanitize or disable external entity processing when parsing XSPF playlist files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application processes external entities defined in a user-supplied XML file. This allows an attacker to control external entity resolution, leading to the ability to retrieve local files or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By manipulating the external entity to point to internal or external resources, an attacker could potentially bypass firewall restrictions and probe internal services or interact with external websites.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read local files on the server if the vulnerable system has access to those files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Importing Malicious XSPF Playlist Files:** A user must be tricked into importing a specially crafted .XSPF playlist file that includes the malicious XML external entity definition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious XSPF file.
- The attacker needs to get a user of the Subsonic server to import this file through the Subsonic's playlist import feature.
