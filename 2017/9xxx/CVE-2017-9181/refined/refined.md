SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV /tmp/portage/media-gfx/autotrace-0.31.1-r8/work/autotrace-0.31.1/input-bmp.c in ReadImage
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A segmentation fault occurs within the `ReadImage` function of `input-bmp.c`, which is triggered during the processing of a malformed BMP image. This suggests a flaw in how the BMP image parsing is handled, leading to an attempt to write to an invalid memory address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a segmentation fault. The root cause seems to be an out-of-bounds write caused by incorrect parsing of the image data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The application crashes due to a segmentation fault. This could lead to a denial-of-service if an attacker can control the input image.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted BMP image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed BMP image to the vulnerable application.
