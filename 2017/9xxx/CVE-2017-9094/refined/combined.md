Unfortunately i will not be able to provide help because the problem is within internals of GIF images

first I would like to say that this image is fuzzed JPEG.

[![hang1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10424605/26121181/183df600-3a7c-11e7-8f6d-88b61e33bb08.jpg)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10424605/26121181/183df600-3a7c-11e7-8f6d-88b61e33bb08.jpg)

however this is a backtrace for where the hanging occured

```
──────────────────────────────[ source:src/imagew-gif.c+219 ]────
 215	 	xs = rctx->image_left + xi;
 216	 	ys = rctx->image_top + yi;
 217
 218	 	// Make sure the coordinate is within the image, and on the screen.
 219	 	if(yi>=(size_t)rctx->image_height) return; 		  ←  $pc
 220	 	if(xs>=(size_t)rctx->screen_width) return;
 221	 	if(ys>=(size_t)rctx->screen_height) return;
 222
 223	 	// Because of how we de-interlace, it's not obvious whether the Y coordinate

```

the problem isn't how is it parsed but it is that it lead to infinite loop somehow
