Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-9605:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl()` function within the VMware virtual GPU (vmwgfx) DRM driver in the Linux kernel. Specifically, when the function is called with an existing buffer, the `backup_handle` variable was not properly initialized. This could lead to the function returning an uninitialized value for `backup_handle`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Variable:** The primary vulnerability is the use of an uninitialized variable (`backup_handle`). In C, uninitialized variables can contain arbitrary values from memory, leading to unpredictable behavior.
*   **Information Leak:** The uninitialized `backup_handle` could potentially leak kernel memory contents to a user-space application via a crafted ioctl call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** A local attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information from uninitialized kernel memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted ioctl Call:** The attacker needs to make a crafted ioctl call to the `vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl()` function in the VMware virtual GPU driver. Specifically, the attacker must call the ioctl with an existing buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to make ioctl calls to the graphics driver.
*   **Ability to call vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl:** The attacker must be able to call this specific ioctl with an existing buffer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves two steps:
    1.  Initializing `backup_handle` to 0 at the beginning of the function to ensure a defined value.
    2.  Setting `backup_handle` to `req->buffer_handle` when a user-provided buffer is found.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel's DRM driver for VMware virtual GPUs.
