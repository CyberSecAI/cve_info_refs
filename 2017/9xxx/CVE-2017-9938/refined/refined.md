Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-9938:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An out-of-bounds write in a logging function within `slra_servicex.exe` in Siemens SIMATIC Logon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The logging function uses a 508-byte buffer and the `vswprintf_s` function to process user-provided data.
*   Insufficient input validation allows an attacker to provide a large input string that overflows the buffer, causing an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   The targeted service (`slra_servicex.exe`) crashes, but automatically restarts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted network packets to the SIMATIC Logon Remote Access service listening on TCP port 16389.
*   The attack can be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the target system with the vulnerable Siemens SIMATIC Logon service running.
*   No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered while investigating CVE-2017-2684.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to send a crafted packet that causes the crash.
*   The issue was assigned S-PCERT#80092 for tracking by the vendor.

**Affected Products:**

*   Siemens SIMATIC Logon versions prior to V1.6

**Solution:**

*   Upgrade to SIMATIC Logon 1.6 or newer.
