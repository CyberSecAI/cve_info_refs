```
{
  "Root cause": "An incorrect state transition in `parse_char_class()` within the Oniguruma library can lead to a heap out-of-bounds write during regular expression compilation. This occurs because a local variable (`vs`) used as an index in `bitset_set_range()` is left uninitialized due to the incorrect state transition, resulting in memory corruption.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds Heap Write",
     "Uninitialized Variable"
  ],
  "Impact": "The vulnerability results in a heap out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption and potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) via a segmentation fault.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during regular expression compilation within the Oniguruma library when processing a crafted character class.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious regular expression pattern to an application utilizing the vulnerable Oniguruma library. The attacker does not require any special privileges, but the crafted regex needs to reach the vulnerable code path."
