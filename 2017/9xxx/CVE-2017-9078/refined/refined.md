Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2017-9078:

**Root Cause:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the TCP listener cleanup of Dropbear SSH.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:** The vulnerability stems from a double-free error in the server's TCP listener cleanup process. This occurs when memory is freed twice, leading to corruption and unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service condition. The double-free can crash the service, making it unavailable.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory mentions this double-free *could potentially allow arbitrary code execution as root by an authenticated user.* This suggests a more severe impact is possible beyond just DoS, although it's not definitively stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:**  The vulnerability is triggered via network connections. The vulnerable code is within the server's listening component.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the Dropbear SSH server.
- **-a option enabled:** The Dropbear SSH server must be running with the `-a` option enabled which allows connections to forwarded ports from any host.

**Summary of additional information:**
- **Affected versions:** Versions 2013.56 to 2016.74 of Dropbear are affected.
- **Fix:** The fix is included in Dropbear 2017.75, which addresses the double-free and other vulnerabilities.
- **NetApp Products:** Multiple NetApp products use Dropbear SSH and are vulnerable. The NetApp advisory (NTAP-20191004-0006) clarifies the -a option required for exploitation is not enabled in specific firmware versions, mitigating this risk in those cases
- **Debian:** Debian has released a security update (DSA-3859-1) to address this issue.
- **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H which indicates a network based attack, with low privileges needed, but high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
