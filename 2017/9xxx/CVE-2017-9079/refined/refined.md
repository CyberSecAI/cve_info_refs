Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an information leak within Dropbear's handling of the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. Specifically, Dropbear parsed this file as root, even if it was a symlink.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Handling:** Dropbear's improper handling of symlinks when parsing `authorized_keys` allowed a local user to potentially bypass file access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An already authenticated local user could create a symlink from their `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to a root-owned file they could not normally access.
- **Potential Sensitive Data Exposure:** If they could get the linked root-owned file to contain valid `authorized_keys` with `command=` options, they might be able to read the contents of that file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access to the system where the vulnerable Dropbear SSH server is running.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system.
- **Symlink Manipulation:** The attacker needs to create a symlink within their `~/.ssh` directory pointing to a target root-owned file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the system running the vulnerable Dropbear SSH server.
- The attacker must be able to create symlinks and modify their `~/.ssh` directory.
- They must already be authenticated to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue, not a privilege escalation.
- The fix involves switching to user permissions when opening the `authorized_keys` file.
- The provided content from NetApp indicates that their products were affected by this vulnerability and they provided fixes, with the exception of a specific set of NetApp HCI BMC which did not have the vulnerable option enabled.

The advisory from Debian also confirms this vulnerability and provides the fix version for their distribution. The mailing list archive from ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au confirms the vulnerability details.
