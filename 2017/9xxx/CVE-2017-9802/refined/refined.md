Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9802:

**Summary:**

The provided content reveals a bug in Apache Sling related to the `Sling.evalString` function, where it was using a non-standard way to parse JSON, which could have led to issues. The issue was resolved by switching to the standard `JSON.parse` method.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `Sling.evalString` function in Apache Sling was using a custom JSON parsing method instead of the standardized `JSON.parse`. This could have resulted in incorrect or inconsistent parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Custom JSON parsing:** The use of a non-standard method for JSON parsing can lead to vulnerabilities, inconsistencies or unexpected behavior, especially when handling untrusted data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The provided information doesn't specify a clear exploit. However, inconsistent parsing of JSON data can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on the context and how the parsed data is used by the application, such as:
    *   **Data corruption/manipulation:** If the custom parsing has bugs or does not handle all valid JSON structures correctly, it might corrupt or misinterpret the data.
    *   **Denial of service:**  Malformed or large JSON payloads might cause the custom parsing logic to crash or hang the application.
    *   **Unexpected behavior:** If parsed JSON is used to control critical functions, errors in parsing could lead to unexpected or harmful behavior of the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector depends on how the `Sling.evalString` is used in the application, but generally it involves supplying crafted JSON data to this function. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to provide or manipulate input that is parsed using the `Sling.evalString` function. The specific position depends on how this function is exposed by the application.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided content from `issues.apache.org` indicates that this is considered a bug and has been fixed.
*   The issue was classified as a "Major" priority bug.
*   The content from `packetstormsecurity.com` and `lists.apache.org` does not provide additional context for this CVE.
*   The fix was included in version `Servlets Post 2.3.22`.

**Further Investigation:**

The official CVE description is not provided so further investigation into the context of `Sling.evalString` and how JSON data is used is required to fully understand the exploitable security implications.
