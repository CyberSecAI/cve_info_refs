Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `user/index.php` file of Dolibarr ERP and CRM. Specifically, the `search_supervisor` and `search_statut` parameters were not being properly validated before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters, allowing them to manipulate the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  A successful SQL injection could expose sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Integrity Violation:**  The attacker could modify or delete data within the database, compromising the integrity of the system.
- **Availability Impact:**  The attacker could potentially disrupt the applicationâ€™s normal operations, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The vulnerable parameters are accessible through HTTP requests, allowing remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.
- A remote attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests to the Dolibarr application, injecting malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `htdocs/user/index.php`.
- The fix includes sanitizing the `search_supervisor` and `search_statut` parameters with the `intcomma` type in the `GETPOST` function, which converts the input to numeric characters only. This prevents the injection of SQL code through these parameters.
- The commit `70636cc59ffa1ffbc0ce3dba315d7d9b837aad04` addresses this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating a high severity level.
- The affected versions are those before 5.0.3, and the patched version is 5.0.3.
