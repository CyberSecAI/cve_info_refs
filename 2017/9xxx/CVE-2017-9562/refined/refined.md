The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9562.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code responsible for validating TLS certificates within the affected applications. This issue may be related to third-party code used by the applications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of TLS certificates, leading to a bypass of secure communication channels.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can intercept banking usernames and passwords while users log into the affected applications. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potential financial loss.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack where an attacker within wireless range intercepts network traffic between the user's device and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be within a wireless range (approximately 50-100 feet) of the victim's device during the login process. They need to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting the network traffic, which can be accomplished with tools like bettercap by enabling HTTPS sniffing and using the “POST” request parser to capture credentials.

**Additional Details:**
The vulnerability is present in the "Freedom 1st Credit Union Mobile Banking" iOS app, version 3.0.0. It is also present in 43 other iOS banking apps, as listed in the article.
