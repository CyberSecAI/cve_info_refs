Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-9305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input by the `RemoveXSSchars()` function in `TikiFilter/PreventXss.php` of Tiki-Wiki. Specifically, the function attempts to remove potentially malicious HTML entities by matching patterns that include padded zeros. However, it fails to account for padding with more than 8 zeros. This flaw can be exploited by padding HTML entities with more than 8 leading zeros, thus bypassing the intended filter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `RemoveXSSchars()` function does not properly handle excessive zero padding in HTML entities, allowing attackers to bypass the intended XSS filter.
*   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The provided blog also mentioned an "incomplete blacklist" in a separate section and includes an example of `<details open ontoggle=prompt(1)>` being unblocked. This shows a flaw in the blacklist approach.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This could allow them to steal user session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, deface the website, or redirect the user to a malicious site.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `editionId` parameter, which is then passed through the flawed `RemoveXSSchars()` filter. Specifically, the vulnerable code is found in `tiki-batch_send_newsletter.php`.
*   **Padded HTML Entities:** The attack vector is based on encoding characters with a hexadecimal or decimal representation prepended with more than 8 zeros, thus bypassing the filter which only considers up to 8 padded zeros

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with a payload encoded using padded HTML entities.
*   **Access to the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable page, specifically `tiki-batch_send_newsletter.php`, and influence the `editionId` parameter.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerability and how to bypass the filter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post provides a specific Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to inject a malicious JavaScript payload by padding the letter "t" with more than 8 leading zeros in the hexadecimal representation: `<a href="javascrip&#x0000000000000000074;:prompt(1)">x</a>`.
* The provided commit `6c016e8f066d2f404b18eaa1af7fa0c7a9651ccd` addresses this issue by removing the limit on zero paddings allowed.
* The blog post also identifies another vulnerability in sysPass related to XSS filtering, which is unrelated to CVE-2017-9305.
