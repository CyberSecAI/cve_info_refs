Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2017-9211.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that during the `skcipher` conversion, the API's `setkey` checks for key sizes and alignment were unintentionally omitted. This allowed the use of invalid key lengths and unaligned memory addresses for keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing key size validation: The code did not check if the provided key length was within the allowed range (minimum and maximum key size) for the cipher algorithm.
- Missing key alignment validation: The code did not verify if the provided key address was properly aligned in memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Use of invalid key sizes could lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect encryption/decryption and potential crashes.
- Use of misaligned keys could cause crashes due to memory access violations.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could supply an invalid key (either incorrect size or unaligned memory address) to the `skcipher` API, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need the ability to call the `skcipher` API and provide a key with an invalid size or unaligned address. This would typically require some level of access to the kernel or a driver interface that uses the crypto API.
