{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap overflow in `dwarf_formsdata()` due to a failure to check if a pointer is within bounds when reading DWARF data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow",
       "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A heap overflow can lead to a segmentation fault or application crash, causing denial of service and potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution if exploited further.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted or fuzzed DWARF object file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious DWARF object file to a program using libdwarf."
