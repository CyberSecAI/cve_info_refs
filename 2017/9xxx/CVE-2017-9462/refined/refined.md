```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'hg serve --stdio' command in Mercurial was vulnerable to command-line injection due to insufficient input sanitization of the repository name.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command-line injection",
    "Lack of input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code on the Mercurial server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a specially crafted repository name (e.g., --debugger) when using 'hg serve --stdio'.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user of the Mercurial server."
