{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NFSv4 client callback channel was not properly shut down during umount operations, leading to a module reference leak.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper shutdown of callback channel, leading to module reference leak.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local attackers with permission to mount NFS filesystems can potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting system resources.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with the ability to mount NFS filesystems.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with permissions to mount NFS filesystems."
