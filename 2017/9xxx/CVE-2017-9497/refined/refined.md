```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The diagnostics menu on the Motorola MX011ANM set-top box does not sanitize input when the Remote Web Inspector is enabled.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The web inspector route allows an attacker to append shell commands to a request, which are then executed as root.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "By posting to a known Web Inspector route on the set-top box, an attacker can inject and execute shell commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the set-top box with the diagnostics menu displayed and the Remote Web Inspector enabled."
