{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-buffer-overflow occurs due to an out-of-bounds read in the `byte_get_little_endian` function when processing a crafted MIPS binary.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash or denial of service condition when processing a specially crafted ELF file, PE file, or other binary file, by enticing a user to compile or execute the crafted binary.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted binary file (ELF/PE or other binary file) is needed to trigger the vulnerability, and the victim must execute a tool like readelf against it.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to process a malicious binary with a vulnerable version of binutils (specifically `readelf`)."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_version": "2.28",
     "vulnerable_function": "`byte_get_little_endian` in `elfcomm.c`, as triggered via the processing of MIPS-specific data in `readelf.c`" ,
     "fixed_version": "The provided commit `c4ab9505b53cdc899506ed421fddb7e1f8faf7a3` indicates that the error handling around the vulnerable code was simplified, resolving the issue. It's not clear if this commit fully addresses the heap overflow but it is associated with this CVE.",

    "notes": "The vulnerability was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL). The fix simplifies the error handling in the processing of MIPS binaries, specifically with regards to how the GOT[1] entry is read."
