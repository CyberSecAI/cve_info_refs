The content is related to CVE-2017-9449.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `bigtree_pending_changes` table query within the `cacheViewData` function in the `auto-modules.php` file. The `table` parameter of the view is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in `bigtree_pending_changes` query.
- Unsanitized input from the `table` parameter of the view.
- Vulnerable code exists in `core/inc/bigtree/auto-modules.php`, `core/admin/ajax/auto-modules/views/searchable-page.php` and `core/admin/modules/developer/modules/views/create.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion.
- An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information such as user credentials or server configurations.
- Ability to take over the server and disrupt its services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious `table` parameter when creating a view.
- The vulnerable parameter is then used in the `cacheViewData` function via the `getSearchResults` and `getView` functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges to create a module and add a view within the BigTree CMS.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the administrative panel and have the required privileges to create and modify modules and their views.
