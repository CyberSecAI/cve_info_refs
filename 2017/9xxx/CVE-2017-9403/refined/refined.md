Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `TIFFReadDirEntryLong8Array` function within `tif_dirread.c` of the LibTIFF library.
*   The issue is a memory leak that occurs when processing specific malformed TIFF images. This leak happens when both `StripOffsets` and `TileOffsets` tags (or `StripByteCounts` and `TileByteCounts`) are present in the image metadata, and the library is not in `DEFER_STRILE_LOAD` mode (which is the default).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The core issue is a memory leak. When processing certain TIFF files, memory is allocated but not freed, leading to a gradual consumption of available memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated processing of crafted TIFF images can lead to memory exhaustion, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Application Crash:** The memory leak can eventually lead to a crash of the application using the LibTIFF library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted TIFF image. An attacker needs to create a TIFF image that triggers the memory leak vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:**  A user or an automated system needs to be tricked into opening the malicious TIFF file. This could involve sending the file via email, hosting it on a website, or using other methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious TIFF Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain a specially crafted TIFF image that triggers the memory leak.
*   **Social Engineering or File Delivery:** The attacker needs a way to get the victim to process the malicious TIFF image. This could involve social engineering or exploiting other vulnerabilities to deliver the file.
*   **No Privilege Requirements:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability. The code execution occurs with the privileges of the user or system that opens the image.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported against libtiff 4.0.7 but affects other versions prior to the fix.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by addressing the memory leak in `tif_dirread.c` and adding a `TIFFClose()` call in error code paths in `tools/tiff2ps.c`.
*   The fix ensures that allocated memory is freed correctly, preventing the memory leak.
*   The bug report mentions that `tiff2ps` is one application where this vulnerability can be triggered.
*   Multiple other memory leak bugs were marked as duplicates of this vulnerability (bug IDs 2680, 2695, and 2682), showing that the root cause was the same.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2017-9403.
