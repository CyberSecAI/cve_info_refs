{
  "CVE-2017-9853": {
    "Root cause": "Weak password policy for user and installer accounts on SMA inverters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Limited character set for passwords.",
      "No password complexity requirements.",
      "No password length requirements.",
      "Maximum password length of 12 characters.",
      "Hidden user accounts with passwords unchangeable by regular users."
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers can easily attack or crack weak passwords, potentially compromising the inverter.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access to the SMA inverter is required. If the inverter is directly connected or behind NAT to the internet, an attack over the internet is possible. This is done by sending crafted packets on the correct port.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Network access to the SMA inverter."
  }
}
