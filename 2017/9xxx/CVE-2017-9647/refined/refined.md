This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting Continental AG's Infineon S-Gold 2 (PMB 8876) chipset used in telematics control modules (TCUs) in various vehicles. Specifically, it mentions CVE-2017-9647 and another vulnerability CVE-2017-9633.

**CVE-2017-9647**

*   **Root cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the processing of AT commands.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow)
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the baseband radio processor of the TCU, potentially allowing an attacker to disable the infotainment system and affect functional features of the vehicle. While not directly impacting critical safety features.
*  **Attack vectors:** Physical connection to the TCU is required
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with physical access to the TCU

**Additional Notes:**
*   The document also describes another vulnerability (CVE-2017-9633) related to improper restriction of operations within a memory buffer, allowing an attacker to access and control memory by exploiting a vulnerability in the temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI) potentially leading to remote code execution on the TCU.
*   Public exploits are available for these vulnerabilities.
*   Affected vehicles include several models from BMW, Ford, Infiniti, and Nissan.
*   Mitigation strategies include TCU deactivation by Nissan/Infiniti and service measures by BMW.
*   Ford had an existing customer satisfaction program for 2G modem updates.
