- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ReadPSDChannel` function in `psd.c` does not properly manage memory allocation when processing crafted PSD files, leading to a memory leak. Specifically, `inflateInit2_` allocates memory that is not freed during error conditions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unfreed memory allocation leading to a memory leak in `ReadPSDChannel` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service due to memory exhaustion by repeatedly processing crafted PSD files.
- **Attack vectors**: Processing a crafted PSD file using the ImageMagick `convert` utility or other ImageMagick tools that call the `ReadPSDChannel` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PSD file to ImageMagick for processing.
