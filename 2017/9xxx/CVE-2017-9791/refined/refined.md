Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-9791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied input when using the Struts 2 Struts 1 plugin. Specifically, when a Struts 1 action uses untrusted input as part of an error message via `ActionMessage`, it becomes vulnerable to OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OGNL Injection:** The core vulnerability is that the application is directly using user-supplied data within OGNL expressions when constructing error messages. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OGNL code.
*   **Struts 1 Plugin Issue:** The vulnerability exists within the Struts 1 plugin's interaction with Struts 2's message handling. When using the Struts 1 plugin, the untrusted input is not properly sanitized before being processed as an OGNL expression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify data or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not the primary impact, exploitation could lead to a denial of service due to the execution of resource-intensive code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is typically an HTTP POST request, where malicious OGNL expressions are embedded within POST parameters (e.g., `name`).
*   **Specific Struts Action:** The vulnerable endpoint is the Struts action being used with the Struts 1 plugin that incorporates the user input within an `ActionMessage`. In the showcase example the saveGangster.action is mentioned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Fields:** The attacker needs to know which input field(s) are used to construct the vulnerable error message. In this example the `name` parameter is used.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is applicable to Struts 2.3.x versions using the Struts 1 plugin with a Struts 1 action.
*   The exploit can be achieved by injecting an OGNL expression via user supplied data. The OGNL expression can be constructed to gain code execution.
*   The provided exploit scripts show an example of such an attack, with an example usage of `ncat` to establish a reverse shell.
*   The advisory suggests avoiding using raw message within the `ActionMessage` class, using resource keys instead.

**CVE-2017-9791 Specific Information:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The CVE has a CVSS v3 score of 8.1 (High), indicating its severity.
*   **Affected NetApp Products:** NetApp has identified "OnCommand Balance" as an affected product.
*   **Oracle:** Oracle also acknowledges that the fix for CVE-2017-9805 (which is an RCE in the Struts REST Plugin) also addresses CVE-2017-9791, among other related vulnerabilities. Oracle recommends applying these fixes.
