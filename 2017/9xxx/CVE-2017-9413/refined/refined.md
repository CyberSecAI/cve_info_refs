  "cve": "CVE-2017-9413",
  "source": "www.exploit-db.com_58411c55_20250124_195050.html",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Subsonic media server's podcast feature and Internet radio settings do not properly validate user-supplied URLs, allowing for Server Side Request Forgery.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can abuse the Podcast feature of subsonic to launch Server Side Request Forgery attacks on the internal network or to the internet. SSRF can be used to bypass firewall restrictions on the LAN.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious link clicked by an authenticated user.",
      "Visiting an attacker controlled webpage."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a logged-in user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious webpage to trigger the SSRF.  The attacker can also make the SSRF persistent by adding a malicious podcast feed URL or using malicious internet radio settings.",
        "details": "The vulnerability can be exploited through two methods:\n1) Subscribing to a malicious podcast using a CSRF attack, which results in a persistent SSRF.\n2) Modifying Internet radio settings using a CSRF attack, which also results in a persistent SSRF. The attacker can redirect the server to a malicious URL"
