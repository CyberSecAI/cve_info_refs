Debian Bug     : 865754 961887 961888 964793

The following CVE(s) were reported against src:qemu:

CVE-2017-9503

    QEMU (aka Quick Emulator), when built with MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2
    Host Bus Adapter emulation support, allows local guest OS
    privileged users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
    dereference and QEMU process crash) via vectors involving megasas
    command processing.

CVE-2019-12068

    In QEMU 1:4.1-1 (1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u8), when executing script in
    lsi_execute_script(), the LSI scsi adapter emulator advances
    's->dsp' index to read next opcode. This can lead to an infinite
    loop if the next opcode is empty. Move the existing loop exit
    after 10k iterations so that it covers no-op opcodes as well.

CVE-2019-20382

    QEMU 4.1.0 has a memory leak in zrle_compress_data in
    ui/vnc-enc-zrle.c during a VNC disconnect operation because libz
    is misused, resulting in a situation where memory allocated in
    deflateInit2 is not freed in deflateEnd.

CVE-2020-1983

    A use after free vulnerability in ip_reass() in ip_input.c of
    libslirp 4.2.0 and prior releases allows crafted packets to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2020-8608

    In libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, tcp_subr.c misuses
    snprintf return values, leading to a buffer overflow in later
    code.

CVE-2020-10756

    An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in the SLiRP
    networking implementation of the QEMU emulator. This flaw occurs
    in the icmp6_send_echoreply() routine while replying to an ICMP
    echo request, also known as ping. This flaw allows a malicious
    guest to leak the contents of the host memory, resulting in
    possible information disclosure. This flaw affects versions of
    libslirp before 4.3.1.

CVE-2020-13361

    In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, es1370_transfer_audio in
    hw/audio/es1370.c does not properly validate the frame count,
    which allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access
    during an es1370_write() operation.

CVE-2020-13362

    In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, megasas_lookup_frame in
    hw/scsi/megasas.c has an out-of-bounds read via a crafted
    reply_queue_head field from a guest OS user.

CVE-2020-13659

    address_space_map in exec.c in QEMU 4.2.0 can trigger a NULL
    pointer dereference related to BounceBuffer.

CVE-2020-13754

    hw/pci/msix.c in QEMU 4.2.0 allows guest OS users to trigger
    an out-of-bounds access via a crafted address in an msi-x mmio
    operation.

CVE-2020-13765

    rom_copy() in hw/core/loader.c in QEMU 4.1.0 does not validate
    the relationship between two addresses, which allows attackers
    to trigger an invalid memory copy operation.

CVE-2020-15863

    Stack-based overflow in xgmac_enet_send() in hw/net/xgmac.c.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u10.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

Subject: CVE-2017-9503 Qemu: scsi: null pointer dereference while processing
 megasas command

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter
emulation support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue. It could
occur while processing megasas commands via megasas_command_complete().

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process
on the host resulting in DoS.

Upstream patches:

   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-06/msg01309.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1459477>

This issue was reported by Zhangyanyu.

Thank you.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH 7/7] megasas: always store SCSIRequest\* into Megasas

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-devel] [PATCH 7/7] megasas: always store SCSIRequest\* into MegasasCmd |
| **Date**: | Tue, 6 Jun 2017 14:17:47 +0200 |

---

```
This ensures that the request is unref'ed properly, and avoids a
segmentation fault in the new qtest testcase that is added.
