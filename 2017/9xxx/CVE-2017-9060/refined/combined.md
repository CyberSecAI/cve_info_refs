Subject: CVE-2017-9060 Qemu: virtio-gpu: host memory leakage in Virtio GPU
 device

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Virtio GPU Device emulator support is
vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while processing
'VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_SET_SCANOUT:' command.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in Dos.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=dd248ed7e204ee8a1873914e02b8b526e8f1b80d>

Reference:
----------
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1452597>

This issue was reported by Li Qiang of Qihoo 360 Gear Team.

Thank you.
