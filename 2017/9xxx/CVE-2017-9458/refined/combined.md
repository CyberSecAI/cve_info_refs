This Site provides opportunities for you to become a member of different communities (“Community”) and actively participate by creating, providing, sharing and uploading information to the Community such as comments, ideas or suggestions for new or improved software products, technologies, marketing/advertising campaigns or product names, data, articles, documents, discussion forum threads, blog entries, computer code, such as software sample code, source code, scripts, patches, bug fixes, binaries or executables, or other information (collectively "Contributions").  Palo Alto Networks assumes no responsibility or liability over the sharing of user Contributions. Contributions are considered non-confidential and non-proprietary unless expressly agreed otherwise, in writing, by Palo Alto Networks.

Palo Alto Networks shall have no obligations to you with regard to its use or disclosure of Contributions, and shall have a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully-paid right to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, perform, display, and distribute the Contributions, including any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such Contributions, for any and all purposes without limitation, and to authorize others to do so as well, without attribution. Palo Alto Networks may, in its sole discretion, remove or delete any Contribution, for any reason, without prior notice.

No right or license in connection with any Contribution is granted to any other user unless the contributing user explicitly agrees in writing to grant such right, license or permission to a user or users. You represent and warrant that you either own or have all the necessary intellectual property rights in the Contributions you upload or share to the Community and that your Contributions do not infringe on the patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights of others.

**Rules of Conduct**

In addition to these Terms and our Privacy Statement, which also apply to the Community, you must abide by the following rules of conduct:

1. Do not advertise, promote, endorse, or market, directly or indirectly, any third-party commercial products, services, solutions, or other technologies. While you may use the Community to provide supplemental information about your own business that might be of interest to other users (without spamming them), you may do so only after you receive the appropriate consents from other relevant users. If it doesn’t naturally arise from a conversation and need, you cannot mention your own business. Any use of the Community for commercial purposes is solely at your own risk and we assume no liability for such use.
2. Do not engage in any unlawful conduct. In particular, do not post, publish, or distribute any defamatory, inappropriate, obscene, infringing or other unlawful material or information.
3. Do not engage in personal attacks or any type of "flaming" of other users, i.e. say mean things online to deliberately hurt someone else. Do not "troll," i.e. post topics or opinions that are designed to provoke a negative response from one or more specific users and do not threaten, harass, stalk, defame, or defraud any person or entity.
4. Do not use offensive language.
5. Do not engage in disruptive, such as persistent off-topic contributions or comments, or statements that might incite other users to violate these Terms or participate in illegal activities.
6. Do not contribute content that contains photos, software or other material protected by intellectual property laws, rights of privacy or publicity, or any other applicable law unless you own or have rights to these materials.
7. If you don’t have to, do not post any instructions, software or other materials that would allow participants or third parties to harm other users' computers or to inappropriately access software or websites.
8. Do not attack, abuse, interfere with, intercept, disrupt, or exploit any users, systems, or services, regardless of how accomplished and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, including but not limited to Denial of Service (DoS), monitoring, crawling, spamming, using bots or scripts, or distributing malware (such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, or adware).
9. Do not falsely impersonate any other person in the forum, including Palo Alto Networks employees or agents.
10. Do not distribute unwanted, unsolicited, or harassing mass email or other messages, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (“spam”) or send deceptive or false source-identifying information, including “spoofing” or “phishing.”
11. Do not misrepresent the source of anything you contribute.
12. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to collect, store, or publish personally identifiable information (a) without the owner’s knowledge and consent, or (b) of a minor under the age of thirteen.
13. Do not disable, disrupt, circumvent, interfere with, or otherwise violate the security of the Site or access any application, system, service, tool, data, account, network, or content without authorization or for unintended purposes.
14. Do not engage in or promote any illegal or criminal activity such as child pornography, gambling, or piracy.
15. Some participants may post Internet website links as part of their Contribution. Palo Alto Networks is not responsible for the content on the websites associated with these links and reminds you that some content and links on the Internet contain malware or inappropriate material that is not suitable for children or may be offensive to some users.
16. You are responsible for all actions you take based on information or advice you receive while online. Use your good judgment when evaluating information provided through the Community or any other communication service. The decision to share information or conduct transactions with anyone is your own; therefore, conduct your own research prior to making any decisions.
17. You acknowledge that you may compete with other users in various lines of business. It is therefore imperative that you act in a manner which does not violate any applicable state, federal or international antitrust laws, regulations or applicable orders. Accordingly, you are responsible for obtaining appropriate legal counsel while acting under these Terms. The Community shall not be used for the purpose of bringing about or attempting to bring about any understanding or agreement, written or oral, formal or informal, express or implied, between and among competitors with regard to their prices, terms or conditions of sale, distribution, volume of production, territories, customers, credit terms or marketing practices. Therefore, there shall be no contribution, discussion, communication, agreement or disclosure among users that are actual or potential competitors regarding their prices, discounts or terms or conditions of sale or licensing of products or services, pricing methods, profits, profit margins or cost data, production plans, market shares, sales territories or markets, allocation of territories or customers, or any limitation on the timing, cost or volume of their research, production or sales.

If you violate these Terms, your access will be terminated immediately and without notice, so be considerate and use the Site for its intended purpose.

# Privacy Statement

Effective Date: March 1, 2024

Welcome! We are Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (“**Palo Alto Networks**”,
“**Company**”, “**we**”,
“**us**” or “**our**”). Our mission is to be the
cybersecurity partner of choice, protecting our digital way of life. We view privacy as an integral
part of delivering on that mission.

This Privacy Statement explains how Palo Alto Networks (including our family of brands, subsidiaries, and related entities when they specifically reference this Privacy Statement) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal information (as defined below) in connection with our websites (the “**Sites**”) and other websites we own and operate that link to this Privacy Statement, and any other related content, platform, services, products, and functionality offered on or through our services (collectively, the “**Services**”).

This Privacy Statement applies to personal information collected and/or used by Palo Alto Networks while acting in the capacity of a data controller, as that term is defined in the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, the “**EU GDPR**” or, where applicable, the “**United Kingdom (UK) GDPR**” (as it forms part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by virtue of section 3 of the UK European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018), as amended and supplemented from time to time (together, herein referred to as the “**GDPR**”), for the purposes and legal bases set out in further detail below. For example, when individuals create accounts within our Customer Service Portal and provide certain personal information (such as name and email address) that is used for authentication purposes, we act as a data controller. When we provide other aspects of our Customer support services (such as reviewing files for troubleshooting), we act as a data processor, or service provider.

This Privacy Statement does not apply to situations where we act as a “processor” or “service provider” in relation to the data our customers submit, manage, use, or process through or as part of our Services (“**Customer Data**”). For additional information about our data processing activities in our role as a processor or service provider, please see our [DPA](/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/legal/palo_alto_networks_customer_data_processing_addendum.pdf) and our [Trust Center](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/trust-center). When acting as data controllers, our customers are responsible for making their own disclosures concerning the rights of individuals (e.g., “**data subjects**” under the GDPR) with respect to personal information and other information regarding data collection and use, in accordance with applicable law.

![](/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/privacy/info-we-collect.png)
## What is Personal Information?

When we use the term “**personal information**” in this Privacy Statement, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. The term does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual and does not apply to other information that is excluded from privacy protections under applicable law.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the term “personal Information” used in this Privacy Statement includes all “**personal data**”, as defined under the EU GDPR, and any applicable national implementing laws, as amended from time to time.

![](/content/dam/pan/en_US/images/privacy/how-we-use.png)

**Personal Information Automatically
Collected**

We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect information you provide to us and information about how you access and use the Services when you visit our services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “tracking technologies”) and we may use third-party partners or technologies to collect this information. Information we collect automatically about you may be combined with other personal information we collect directly from you or receive from other sources.

We, and our third-party partners, use tracking technologies to automatically collect usage and device information, such as:

* **Information about the computer, tablet, smartphone or other device you use**, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system, date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or your account (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other such information. We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.
* **Information about the way you access and use our services**, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our services, how frequently you access the Services, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the services from multiple devices, and other browsing behavior and actions you take on the Sites. We may also record information you enter when you interact with our Services or engage in chat features through our Services.
* **Information about how you use the Services**, such as the pages you visit, the links you click, the ads you view and click on, videos you watch, and other similar actions. We may also use third-party tools to collect information you provide to us or information about how you use the Services and may record your mouse movements, scrolling, clicks and keystroke activity on the Services and other browsing, search or purchasing behavior. These tools may also record information you enter when you interact with our Services or engage in chat features through our Services.
* **Information about your location**, such as general geographic location that we or our third-party providers may derive from your IP address.
* **Analytics information**. We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the services and to understand more about the demographics of our users. You can learn more about Google’s practices at <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners> and view its opt-out options at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

All of the information collected automatically through these tools allows us to improve your customer experience. For example, we may use this information to enhance and personalize your user experience, to monitor and improve our Sites and Services, and to improve the effectiveness of our Services, offers, advertising, communications, features such as live and automated chat and customer service. We may also use this data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our services.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies; however, doing so may negatively impact your experience using the services, as some features and services may not work properly. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.

We and our third-party partners may also use cookies and tracking technologies for advertising purposes.

For more information about these practices and your choices regarding cookies, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy#cookie-notice). To opt-out of targeted advertising cookies, click on the link to “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” in the website footer to adjust your targeting cookie preferences.

third
parties:

  about individuals that they permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we
  receive is dependent upon an individual’s privacy settings with the social network, and
  including, but not limited to, your profile information, profile picture, gender, username, user
  ID
  associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, and any other
  information

  we
  do not otherwise have from, for example, publicly available sources, third-party data providers,

## Legal Bases for Processing

Under the GDPR, we process your personal information as follows:

* When it is necessary for the performance of a **contract** to which you are party,
  or
  to take steps at your request prior to agreeing a contract: This applies to any processing where
  you
  sign a contract with us, for example when you become our customer, participate in our affiliate
  or
  premium partner program, or deliver services to us as a vendor or contractor. This may also
  include
  our [Terms of Use](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use).
* We have a **legitimate interest** where such interest is not overridden by your
  interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. This includes, but is not limited to, the
  following
  processing activities:
  + **When we communicate**: To respond to your inquiries and, on some
    occasions,
    keep
    records in case of complaints or legal claims.
  + **When you use our Services**: When you access and use our Services (for
    example,
    LIVEcommunity), we process technical and analytics data to see if and how our Services
    can
    be
    improved, so that we can offer you a better user experience in the future.
  + **Global Suppression List**: To avoid contacting you again if you have

    useful
    and
    relevant, i.e., provide you with excellent customer service.
  + **Sharing personal information with other parties**: To run our business
    efficiently and securely.
* Your **consent**: Wherever you consent to the processing, for example when you sign
  up
  for our newsletters or events, request a demo, free trial or a download, or submit a survey.
  Here,
  your consent is *implied*, meaning that you consent by submitting a particular form to
  us. We
  also rely on your consent for using cookies and other technologies on our website when you
  explicitly agree to these. Note that your default setting depends on your location (country), as
  the
  rules for using such technologies vary across jurisdictions.

  comply
  with laws and regulations related to bookkeeping, accounting, taxation, employment, and other

## Your Rights in Respect of Your Personal Information

In accordance with applicable privacy law, you may have the following rights in respect of your
personal
information:

* ****Right of access.** You have the right to obtain:**
  + confirmation of whether, and where, we are processing your personal information;
  + information about the categories of personal information we are processing, the purposes
    for
    which we process your personal information, and information as to how we determine
    applicable
    retention periods;
  + information about the categories of recipients with whom we may share your personal
    information;
    and
  + a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
* **Right of portability.** You have the right, in certain circumstances, to receive
  a
  copy of the personal information you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used,
  machine-readable format that supports re-use, or to request the transfer of your personal
  information to another person.
* **Right to rectification**. You have the right to obtain rectification of any
  inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about you without undue delay.
* **Right to erasure**. You have the right, in some circumstances, to require us to
  erase
  your personal information without undue delay if the continued processing of that personal
  information is not justified.
* **Right to restriction**. You have the right, in some circumstances, to require us
  to
  limit the purposes for which we process your personal information if the continued processing of
  the
  personal information in this way is not justified, such as where the accuracy of the personal
  information is contested by you.
* **Right to withdraw consent**. If you have provided consent for the processing of
  your
  personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent,
  this will not affect the lawfulness of our use of your personal information before your
  withdrawal.

Under the GDPR, you also have the right to object to any processing based on our legitimate interests
where there are grounds relating to your particular situation. There may be compelling reasons for
continuing to process your personal information, and we will assess and inform you if that is the
case.
You can object to marketing activities for any reason.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. Information
about
how to contact your local data protection authority is available [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm). If
you
are based in the UK or Switzerland, your local data protection authorities are the UK Information
Commissioner's Office (<https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/>) and the
Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (<https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/deredoeb/kontakt.html>),
respectively.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please visit via our Individual Rights Form or contact us using one of the methods listed [here](#contact-us). Due to the confidential nature of data processing, we reserve the right to verify your identity when exercising any of the above rights.

## Data Retention

We store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes
set
out in this Privacy Statement, and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business
interests. If your personal information is subject to the EU GDPR or UK GDPR, the criteria used to
determine the period for which personal data about you will be retained varies depending on the
legal
basis under which we process the personal data:

* **Contract.** Where we are processing personal data based on contract, we generally
  will retain your personal data for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited
  period
  of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for
  legal
  claims that could arise from our contractual relationship.
* **Legitimate Interests.** Where we are processing personal data based on our
  legitimate
  interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on
  the
  particular interest, taking into account your fundamental interests and your rights and
  freedoms.
* **Consent.** Where we are processing personal data based on your consent, we
  generally
  will retain your personal data until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of
  time
  necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable
  service
  for which we process that personal data.
* **Legal Obligation.** Where we are processing personal data based on a legal
  obligation, we generally will retain your personal data for the period of time necessary to
  fulfill
  the legal obligation.
* **Legal Claim.** We may need to apply a “legal hold” that retains
  information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim or intent to
  establish a claim. In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which
  typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.

We also consider the volume, nature, and sensitivity of your personal data, as well as any potential
risk
of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of that personal data.

## Storing and Transferring Your Personal Information

**Security**. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful access, destruction, loss, change, or damage. We will never contact you requesting your account ID, password, credit or debit card information or national identification numbers. Please note that email sent over the Internet may not be secure and should not be used to communicate confidential and/or sensitive personal information to us. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of any information you send to us over the Internet when using email.

**International Transfers of Your Personal Information**. The personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in to locations where we and our third-party service providers have operations, including in the United States of America. For example, if you are accessing our Services from the EEA, UK or Switzerland, your personal information may be processed outside of the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, respectively.

In the event of such a transfer, we ensure that: (i) the personal information is transferred to countries recognised as offering an adequate level of protection; or (ii) the transfer is made pursuant to appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission. If you wish to inquire further about these safeguards used, please [contact us](#contact-us) or visit our [Trust Center](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/trust-center).

**Purposes of Data Processing**

Palo Alto Networks may act as a data processor or a data controller when processing non-HR personal data transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States of America, depending on the product(s) or service(s) being provided. The types of non-HR data Palo Alto Networks collect and process varies depending on the business relationship, the product or service being provided, customers’ preferences, contractual requirements with customers, and the legitimate interests, including marketing, security, billing, transaction processing, product support, and relationship management, as set forth in the [Privacy Statement](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy), [Privacy & Product Datasheets](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/datasheets/product-privacy-datasheets), and [Customer Data Processing Agreement (DPA)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/legal/palo_alto_networks_customer_data_processing_addendum.pdf).

**Notice**. At the time of data collection, or as soon as practicable thereafter, including via our [Customer Data Processing Agreement (DPA)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/legal/palo_alto_networks_customer_data_processing_addendum.pdf), Palo Alto Networks notifies data subjects about its data practices regarding personal data, including the types of personal data it collects about them, the purposes for which it collects and uses such personal data, the types of third parties to which it discloses such personal data and the purposes for which it does so, the rights of data subjects to access their personal data, and the choices and means that Palo Alto Networks offers for limiting its use and disclosure of such personal data.

**Choice**. Palo Alto Networks offers individuals the opportunity to opt-out of personal data, or opt-in for sensitive data being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than to Palo Alto Networks service providers under contract or pursuant to lawful request as set forth below), or (ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you if such circumstances arise. Where personal data is processed on behalf of a Customer, we will work with that Customer to comply with any individual’s choices for limiting use or disclosure of personal data, in accordance with the Customer’s instructions.

**Access**. Individuals whose personal data may be processed by Palo Alto Networks are entitled to obtain confirmation of whether such personal data is being processed, access the information held, and ask us to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the laws. Where Palo Alto Network processes personal data on behalf of a Customer and receives individual requests regarding the personal data use or disclosure relating to the Customer, Palo Alto Networks will work with the Customer to comply with such requests in accordance with applicable law and our obligations under the DPF. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

**Accountability for Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third Parties)**. Palo Alto Networks may transfer personal data to certain third parties (including as described in our [Customer Data Processing Agreement (DPA)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/legal/palo_alto_networks_customer_data_processing_addendum.pdf) and [Subprocessors List](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/services/list-of-sub-processors-sheet.pdf)). Where we transfer personal data to a third party, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure the third party processes personal data for limited and specified purposes and in a manner consistent with our DPF obligations. Where the transfer is to a third-party agent acting on our behalf, we may be liable if such third parties fail to meet those obligations.

**Security**. Palo Alto Networks takes reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We take into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data when we implement appropriate technical and organizational procedures to help safeguard and secure personal data from such risks.

**Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation**. Palo Alto Networks will retain personal data for a reasonable period of time necessary to comply with applicable law, in accordance with our document retention practice, and in a manner that is compatible with and relevant to the purposes for which it was collected or authorized by individuals. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

**Lawful Requests**. We may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Palo Alto Networks will only disclose such personal data in accordance with our [government and law enforcement agency request handling process](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/legal/how-palo-alto-networks-responds-to-government.pdf).

Palo Alto Networks has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the DPF Principles to a U.S.- based, independent dispute resolution mechanism, the Data Privacy Framework Services Program operated by the **Better Business Bureau (BBB) National Programs**.

## DO NOT SELL OR SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION

We respect your right to opt out of the sale of your personal information to third parties. While we generally do not engage in the sale of personal information that we obtain from you via our Sites, there may be limited circumstances where we “share” personal information with third parties with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. This may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA or other similar laws. Specifically, this sharing occurs when we permit certain third party advertising networks, social media companies, and similar businesses to collect and process your personal information (including preferences, commercial information and internet, network, and device information) directly from your browser or device through cookies or tracking technologies in use when you visit or interact with our Sites. As further discussed in our [Cookie Notice](#cookie-notice), these third parties then process your personal information to provide you with relevant ads on our behalf, measure and analyze our ad campaigns, detect and report fraud to promote the security of our Services, and perform similar processing purposes, subject to the third parties’ privacy policies.

To opt out of cookies and tracking technologies on our Sites, please visit our [homepage](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com)’s cookie banner and open the “**Manage My Cookies**” link to visit the “**Privacy Preference Center**” where you can select your preferences and opt out of our use of cookie and tracking information.

To learn more about online advertising and other tracking technologies and what choices you have regarding their use, you may opt out of certain interest-based advertising, across our Sites and other websites on the Internet, by using the following resources:

(i) You may opt-out of tracking and receiving tailored advertisements on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and other similar entities by downloading the App Choices app at [www.aboutads.info/appchoices or use the [DAA’s CCPA App-based Opt-Out Tool.](http://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices)](https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices)

(ii) You may opt-out of receiving permissible targeted advertisements by using the NAI Opt-out tool available at [optout.networkadvertising.org](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or visiting [About Ads.](https://optout.aboutads.info/)

Please note that we do not maintain or control any third party opt-out mechanisms and are not responsible for their operation.

***Authorized Agents***

In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent (as that term is defined by the CCPA) to submit requests on your behalf through the designated methods set forth in these U.S. Disclosures where we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.

For requests to know or delete personal information, we require the following for verification purposes:

1. a valid power of attorney; or

# COOKIES CHART

**Strictly Necessary**

Necessary cookies help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and

**Analytics / Performance**

We use analytics cookies to make aggregated reports on visitor interactions with our website. The
reports
include information regarding the time spent on the websites and the geographic area from which the
user
is connected. We use such information to optimize our website and offer the best user experience. We
set
such analytics features to anonymize your IP address. In that case, we don’t process personal
information. In fact, the full IP address is never written nor memorized by a system. For instance,
if
your IP is 12.428.58.394, the technology promptly erases the last three numbers. In such way, we are
not
able to link an IP like 12.428.58.0 to an individual. Where such analytics technologies are based on
the
processing of your entire Internet Protocol (IP)address, we ask for your consent to process such
information.
