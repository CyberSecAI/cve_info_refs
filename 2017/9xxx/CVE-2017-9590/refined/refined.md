The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9590.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the code used to validate TLS certificates within the affected applications. This issue is potentially derived from third-party code integrated into the applications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper TLS certificate validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker within range can silently intercept the banking username and password of a user logging into the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is carried out wirelessly through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The attacker needs to be within a range of approximately 50â€“100 feet of the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range (50-100 feet) of the victim and be able to intercept network traffic. They also need to have the ability to perform a MITM attack using tools like bettercap.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
