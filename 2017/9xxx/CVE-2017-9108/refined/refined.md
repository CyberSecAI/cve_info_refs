Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper handling of a missing final newline character when reading input from stdin in the `adnshost` utility.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  `adnshost` reads data from stdin into a buffer. When a final newline is missing from the input, the code incorrectly increments the `used` variable, which tracks the amount of buffer space used.
- The `r` variable which tracks the read length is set and then used to increment `used`, which may cause reading and processing of one byte beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the `adnshost` utility, leading to a denial of service. The out-of-bounds read can cause a crash. It may also leak a byte value.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `adnshost` reads input from stdin that lacks a trailing newline character.
- An attacker can exploit this by providing crafted input to `adnshost` via stdin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the input provided to the `adnshost` utility via stdin. They need the ability to execute the `adnshost` utility with crafted input.
