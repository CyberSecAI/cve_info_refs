Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-9979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input within the QuantaStor API. Specifically, when a REST call is made for a method that is not implemented on the server, the server returns a response containing the invalid method that was invoked without sanitizing the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application reflects back the invalid method name provided by the user, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code. This is due to the lack of input sanitization in the error response.
*   **CWE-79:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
*   **CWE-203:** Information Exposure Through Discrepancy.  (This is more related to CVE-2017-9978 but is included in the advisory)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the response, potentially leading to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the user's browser.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request (qsCall parameter):** By crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the `/qstorapi` endpoint with the `qsCall` parameter containing malicious JavaScript, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability.
*   **HTTP POST Request (JSON method parameter):** By sending an HTTP POST request to the `/qstorapi/jsonrpc` endpoint with a JSON payload where the "method" key contains malicious JavaScript, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable QuantaStor instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities are unauthenticated, meaning an attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit them.
*   **User Interaction (for impact):**  The malicious script is executed within the victim's browser, so the victim must interact with the malicious response for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable API endpoints are `/qstorapi` and `/qstorapi/jsonrpc`.
*   The `qsCall` parameter in GET requests and the "method" key in JSON POST requests are the injection points.
*   The vulnerability exists because the application fails to sanitize the error response that includes the user-supplied invalid method name.
*   The affected software is OSNEXUS QuantaStor v4 virtual appliance, and it is fixed in version 4.3.1.

In summary, CVE-2017-9979 describes an unauthenticated reflected XSS vulnerability present in the QuantaStor API due to a lack of sanitization of user-provided input in error responses.
