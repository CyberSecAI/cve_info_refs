{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an issue in the way PHP handles the destruction of zval pointers during array manipulation, particularly when dealing with large array indices and references.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect reference counting during array element deletion",
      "Use-after-free due to premature deallocation of memory"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit leads to a segmentation fault and denial of service. In the context of NetApp products, this could lead to the disruption of services dependent on the vulnerable PHP installation, potentially impacting data availability and management functionality. According to the netapp advisory, this CVE could lead to arbitrary code execution, which has higher impact than just denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is triggered by executing PHP code that constructs and manipulates an array using large indices and references, which causes the reference counter to decrement incorrectly, leading to a use-after-free during the destruction of the array. Remote exploitation is possible via a web interface using a crafted HTTP request.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code on the server using a web interface, which typically requires no authentication. The attacker would need to send a specific crafted request which executes the vulnerable php code."
