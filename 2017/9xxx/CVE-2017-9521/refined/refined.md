  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the exposure of unnecessary network services on devices to interfaces and users that should not have access, violating the principle of least privilege.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unnecessary network services exposed on the affected modems, including services that allow arbitrary code execution and file retrieval.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the affected devices, retrieve files from the device's filesystem, and obtain sensitive data, including wireless network passwords and login credentials of Comcast customers.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through network access, both from the local LAN and the public internet.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers can be local LAN users or remote users on the public internet. They require network connectivity to the affected modem to exploit the vulnerabilities."
