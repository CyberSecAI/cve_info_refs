Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-9730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `rdr.php` file of nuevoMailer version 6.0 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `r` parameter in `rdr.php`, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database query.
- **Time-based SQL Injection:** The exploit specifically leverages time-based SQL injection, which relies on the database server's response time to infer information. This allows an attacker to potentially retrieve data even if the results of the query are not directly displayed to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database.
- **Data Exposure:** This could lead to the extraction of sensitive information like usernames, passwords, email addresses, or other confidential data stored in the database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could also potentially modify or delete database records, leading to data integrity issues or complete data loss.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database permissions, the attacker might be able to escalate privileges within the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely over HTTP(S).
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is the `r` parameter in the URL when accessing the `rdr.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the target web application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker should have knowledge of SQL injection techniques, including time-based injection.
- **Target URL:** The attacker must know the URL of the vulnerable `rdr.php` script and be able to craft malicious requests to the vulnerable parameter.
- **SQL Injection tools:** Tools like sqlmap can be used to automate the exploitation process.

**Additional Information:**
- **Mitigation:** The vendor was notified and intended to fix the vulnerability.
- **Filtering Bypass:** The exploit uses `equaltolike` and `between` tampered to bypass possible filtering.
- **CVE assignment:** The CVE was assigned after vendor notification.
