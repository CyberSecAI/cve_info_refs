Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-9526

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a side-channel timing attack on the EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) session key within the libgcrypt library. The library was not using constant-time point operations in the MPI library during the signing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The core issue is a timing side-channel vulnerability. By observing the time taken for cryptographic operations, an attacker can deduce information about the session key.
- **Non-Constant Time Operations:** The vulnerability exists because the library wasn't using constant-time operations when handling the EdDSA session key. This means the time taken for operations varied depending on the key's value, leaking information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Secret Key Recovery:** An attacker who learns the EdDSA session key via the timing attack can easily recover the long-term secret key associated with that session. This compromises the security of the system, enabling impersonation and other malicious actions.
- **Information Disclosure:** The timing attack allows for the disclosure of sensitive information related to the cryptographic operations being performed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Side-Channel Timing Analysis:** The attack is carried out by timing the cryptographic operations, observing subtle differences in execution times to infer the session key.
- **Physical Proximity:** While not explicitly stated, side-channel attacks often require some degree of physical proximity to the system under attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs the capability to precisely measure the timing of the vulnerable cryptographic operations.
- **Knowledge of Cryptographic Algorithms:** The attacker needs a good understanding of how EdDSA works and the underlying mathematical operations that need to be timed to extract information.
- **Side-Channel Access:** The attacker needs to have a way of monitoring the execution of cryptographic operations on the target system. This could be via local access, shared infrastructure, or potentially via remote timing differences, depending on the environment.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in libgcrypt version 1.7.7
- The fix involves storing the session key in secure memory and using constant-time operations in the MPI library.
-  Affected versions of libgcrypt are 1.6.1, 1.7.6 (and older), while versions 1.7.7 and above are not affected.
