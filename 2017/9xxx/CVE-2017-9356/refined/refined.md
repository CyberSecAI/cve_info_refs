{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'searchStr' parameter of the '/Search-Results' endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can hijack a logged-in user's session. This allows the attacker to change the user's password, invalidate their session while maintaining access, and potentially gain full admin privileges on the web application.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that injects a javascript payload into the 'searchStr' parameter of the '/Search-Results' endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious script and have a victim visit that URL."
