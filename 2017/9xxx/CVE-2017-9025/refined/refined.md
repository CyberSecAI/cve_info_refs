- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap buffer overflow due to unbounded `strcpy` function used to copy data from HTTP cookie header into a fixed size buffer on the heap.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow vulnerability. The `strcpy` function is used to copy attacker controlled data into a fixed size buffer without any bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite function pointers located on the heap. By doing so they can gain arbitrary code execution on the device, which operates as a privileged process. This would allow the attacker to take full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web server with an overly long cookie header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the device's web server. This can be achieved through direct connection to the device's WiFi, or if the device is connected to a compromised network, it can be exploited from that network as well. The device's web server listens on all interfaces.
