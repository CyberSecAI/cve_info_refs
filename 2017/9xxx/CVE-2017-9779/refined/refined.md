Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is actually CVE-2017-9772, not CVE-2017-9779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the OCaml runtime environment variables `CAML_CPLUGINS`, `CAML_NATIVE_CPLUGINS`, and `CAML_BYTE_CPLUGINS` could be used to auto-load code into OCaml executables. The OCaml runtime environment did not properly check the effective user ID before loading these plugins, which could be leveraged in setuid binaries to gain escalated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Uncontrolled Plugin Loading:** The OCaml runtime allows the loading of custom plugins through environment variables without sufficient checks.
-   **Lack of Privilege Check:** The runtime does not verify that the effective user ID matches the real user ID before loading plugins, opening a security hole when the setuid bit is set.
-   **Use of `getenv` for Environment Variables:** The standard `getenv` function was used to retrieve environment variables related to plugin loading, which is vulnerable in setuid scenarios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user could execute a setuid OCaml binary and, by setting the `CAML_*CPLUGINS` environment variables to point to a malicious shared object, could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the setuid executable, typically leading to root access if the binary is setuid to root.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker gains control over the execution flow of the program by injecting custom code, effectively escalating their privileges to that of the binary's owner.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerable design by setting malicious paths in environment variables like `CAML_CPLUGINS`.
-   **Setuid Binaries:** The vulnerability is only exploitable in programs with the setuid bit set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
-   **Ability to Execute Setuid Binaries:** The attacker must be able to execute an OCaml binary that has the setuid bit set.
-   **Ability to Create Shared Objects (.so files):** The attacker needs to be able to create a shared object containing malicious code.
-   **Environment Variable Control:** The attacker needs to be able to set environment variables, particularly the `CAML_*CPLUGINS` ones.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability affects OCaml versions 4.04.0 and 4.04.1.
-   The fix in OCaml 4.04.2 involves modifying `Sys.getenv` and `Unix.getenv` to raise an exception if the process has elevated privileges and the OCaml runtime now uses this function for relevant environment variables.
-   A function `Sys.unsafe_getenv` is provided for strict backward compatibility.
-   CVE-2017-9779 is mentioned as a related but lesser vulnerability in older versions.
-   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-114 (Process Control).
-   CVSS v2 Vector: AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:H/TD:L/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L.
