The provided content relates to CVE-2017-9451.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `acp.php` file, specifically affecting the `pages.edit_form.php` file. The application fails to sanitize the `editpage` parameter when building the form action URL allowing for XSS injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Input provided in the `editpage` parameter of the URL is reflected back in the HTML without proper encoding, allowing for the execution of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application. This could be used to:
  - Steal cookies (as demonstrated in the proof of concept) and potentially hijack admin sessions.
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Deface the admin panel
  - Perform actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can craft a malicious URL, specifically targeting the `acp.php` file with a payload injected in the `editpage` parameter.
- The attacker can then trick an administrator into clicking on the specially crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create and distribute a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs an administrator to click the malicious link to execute the JavaScript payload in their browser.
- No special privileges are required beyond the ability to entice the administrator to visit the crafted URL.
