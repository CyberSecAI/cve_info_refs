Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7718:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- An out-of-bounds access issue exists in the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator within QEMU. This issue arises during the copying of VGA data, specifically when utilizing bitblt functions like `cirrus_bitblt_rop_fwd_transp_`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Out-of-bounds access:** The vulnerability allows memory access beyond the intended boundaries when copying VGA data within the emulator.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can crash the QEMU process, leading to a denial of service for virtualized systems.
-  **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although primarily described as leading to a crash, there's a potential for privileged users within the guest to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process under certain circumstances.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Guest-to-host escape:** A privileged user or process within a guest operating system can exploit the vulnerability.
-   The vulnerability is triggered by specific operations performed within the guest, affecting the host's QEMU process.
- Triggered through VNC display updates.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-  **Privileged access:** An attacker needs to have privileged access (root or equivalent) within a virtualized guest operating system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- The vulnerability is present in qemu-kvm-rhev and qemu-kvm packages.
-   The issue was reported by Jiangxin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.) and Li Qiang (Qihoo 360 Gear Team).
-   Red Hat has addressed this issue in various security advisories including RHSA-2017:1430, RHSA-2017:1431 and RHSA-2017:1206.
- The vulnerability also affects Red Hat OpenStack platforms.
- Patches were made upstream to correct the vulnerability in QEMU.
