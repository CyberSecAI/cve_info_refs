Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7674:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the Tomcat's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) filter does not send a "Vary: Origin" HTTP header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of the "Vary: Origin" HTTP header in the CORS filter's responses. This header is essential for informing caches that the response may vary depending on the origin of the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The absence of the "Vary: Origin" header can lead to cache poisoning. If a response is cached without this header, subsequent requests from different origins might receive incorrect responses intended for another origin. This could result in sensitive data leakage through both client-side and server-side caches.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting the way caching mechanisms interact with responses that lack the "Vary: Origin" header. An attacker would not need to directly interact with the Tomcat server, but rather manipulate requests to trigger the caching of a response lacking "Vary: Origin".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to:
1.  Be able to generate requests with a specific origin.
2.  Be in a position to influence or utilize a cache that stores responses from the vulnerable Tomcat server.
3. No authentication or local access is required for exploitation.

**Summary of CVE-2017-7674:**
The vulnerability is that the CORS filter in Apache Tomcat does not add a `Vary: Origin` header. This omission can lead to cache poisoning where responses intended for one origin are served to another due to caching, which can result in sensitive data leaks.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Tomcat versions 7.0.41 to 7.0.78, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.44, and 8.5.0 to 8.5.15.
- Patches were applied to Tomcat versions 7.0.81, 8.0.45, and 8.5.16 to fix the issue.
- Mitigation included setting the readonly parameter of the DefaultServlet to "true" and blocking HTTP methods that permit resource modification.
- Red Hat assigned an "Important" severity to this vulnerability.
