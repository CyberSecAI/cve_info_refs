Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7382:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in `PoDoFo::PdfFontFactory::CreateFont`. This occurs when the function attempts to access a member of a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted PDF file, processed by the `podofotxtextract` tool, triggers the null pointer dereference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file.
- The attacker needs the user to process the malicious PDF file using the vulnerable `podofotxtextract` tool.

**More Details:**

- The crash occurs in `PdfFontFactory.cpp:200` within `PoDoFo::PdfFontFactory::CreateFont` when processing a crafted PDF file using the `podofotxtextract` tool.
- The AddressSanitizer output clearly indicates a read memory access on address `0x000000000000` (null pointer).
- The specific code line `PdfFontFactory.cpp:200` in the PoDoFo library attempts to access a member using a pointer that is null.
- The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The affected version is 0.9.5 of PoDoFo.
- The provided reproducer is available at: `<https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00251-podofo-nullptr3>`
- This is one of four null pointer dereference vulnerabilities reported in the same blog post.
