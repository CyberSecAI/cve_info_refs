Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7764:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" Unicode block when used in domain names.  These characters, classified as "Aspirational Use Scripts" under older Unicode standards, were being mixed with characters from other Unicode blocks in the address bar. Instead of being displayed in their "punycode" representation, they were rendered as their regular glyphs, potentially leading to character confusion. This could be used in domain name spoofing attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **IDN Spoofing:** The core vulnerability is the susceptibility to Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) spoofing. The rendering of Canadian Syllabics mixed with other scripts allows for visually similar but distinct domain names to be created.
*   **Character Confusion:**  The mixing of scripts allows an attacker to register domain names that are visually similar to legitimate ones, thereby tricking users into visiting malicious sites.
*   **Incorrect Unicode Handling:** Firefox was adhering to the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile of older Unicode standards, which allowed this type of mixing.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Domain Spoofing:** Attackers can register domains that look similar to legitimate sites, tricking users into providing credentials or sensitive information on a spoofed page.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The attack vector is primarily the address bar of the Firefox browser. By crafting a domain name that mixes scripts, an attacker can make a malicious domain visually resemble a trusted one.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Domain Registration:** Attackers need to be able to register domain names using the mixed script approach. 
*   **User Interaction:** The attack is primarily passive, relying on the user to visit the crafted URL.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The issue was reported by Samuel Erb and was also reported to Chromium.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by updating Firefox's behavior to align with the upcoming Unicode version 10.0, which removes the "Aspirational Use Scripts" category, treating these characters as "Limited Use Scripts".
*   A patch was created to treat "Aspirational scripts" the same as "Restricted" scripts.
*   The fix was applied to Firefox 54, 55 and ESR 52.
*   The vulnerability is platform-agnostic as it's related to the handling of unicode.
*   Some TLDs (Verisign) block the registration of domains mixing Latin with Canadian Syllabics which limits the impact.

**Summary**

CVE-2017-7764 is a domain spoofing vulnerability in Firefox resulting from the improper rendering of mixed script domain names in the address bar. Attackers could exploit this to create visually similar but malicious domain names, and trick users into visiting a malicious site. The issue was resolved by aligning Firefoxâ€™s IDN handling with the newer Unicode standards.
