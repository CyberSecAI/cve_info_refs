Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-5470: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 54, Firefox ESR 52.2, and Thunderbird 52.2](#CVE-2017-5470)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53, Firefox ESR 52.1, and Thunderbird 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1461264#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2017-06-14 04:40:53 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Attached file
[1-domain\_list\_sorted\_by\_alexa.txt](attachment.cgi?id=8867025)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8867025&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.96 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Firefox should prevent the “Canadian Syllabics” unicode block from rendering in domain names with characters from other unicode blocks. This was observed in data found in the Certificate Transparency log while seeking to quantify the IDN impersonation/phishing problem (raw data attached).
REPRODUCTION CASE
There are a series of characters in the “CANADIAN SYLLABICS” unicode block which can be used to impersonate other domains. I believe mixing this block with other unicode blocks should be disallowed and the punycode value should be displayed. The characters within this set that I believe could be abused:
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/unified_canadian_aboriginal_syllabics/list.htm>
(I do not know the registration status of any of the domains below)
<http://xn--youtue-084a.com/> -- youtuᖯe.com -- example domain
<http://xn--youtbe-z72a.com/> -- youtᑌbe.com -- example domain
<http://xn--uny-8wq.com/> -- ᑭuny.com -- example domain
<http://xn--oor-hxq.com> -- ᑯoor.com -- example domain
<http://xn--ego-73q.com/> -- ᒪego.com -- example domain
<http://xn--fc-lym.com/> -- fcᒿ.com -- example domain is not fc2.com (alexa top 1m #97) -- this is likely the hardest to see (based on the fonts I’m using)
<http://xn--ulu-7sr.com/> -- ᕼulu.com -- example domain
<http://invalid.xn--acebook-yp9a.com/> -- ᖴacebook.com -- example domain
Tested with Firefox Nightly 55.0a1 (2017-05-11) (32-bit)
This issue has also been reported to chromium
Actual results:
unicode domains are displayed when mixing the “CANADIAN SYLLABICS” unicode block with other unicode characters.
Expected results:
Punycode values should have been displayed when mixing the “CANADIAN SYLLABICS” unicode block with other unicode characters.
---- background ----
(please excuse the length of this report)
To form the attached lists, I cross referenced the Google CT Pilot log and the Alexa top 1 million domains (only .com domains).
There are a fair number of false positives (non-abusive domain impersonations or python unidecode failures), but I choose not to manually remove them.

According to <http://unicode.org/repository/draft/trunk/Public/security/10.0.0/IdentifierStatus.txt> the Canadian Syllabics block (U+1400 -> U+167F) is not allowed in identifiers, and therefore not in IDNA2008. So why are we accepting them?

By default, we have network.IDN.restriction\_profile set to "moderate". At the Moderately Restrictive level[1], Canadian Syllabics characters are accepted as part of the identifier profile thanks to their status as an "Aspirational" script[2], and the Moderately Restrictive profile allows a mixture of "Latin with other Recommended or Aspirational scripts except Cyrillic and Greek"[1].
So it looks like our behavior is correct according to the specifications we're implementing; but I agree that some of these examples look problematic.
Two possible fixes:
(a) Change the default setting for network.IDN.restriction\_profile from "moderate" to "high". This will force punycode rendering for mixed Latin+UCAS labels, since this combination is not one of the handful of mixtures that the Highly Restrictive profile allows.
(b) Exclude UCAS from the scripts that are allowed to be mixed with Latin at the Moderate level, like Cyrillic and Greek. To do this, we'd need to adjust the lookup tables used by nsIDNService::illegalScriptCombo in netwerk/dns/nsIDNService.cpp. However, given that what we're implementing here is a Unicode standard, we should also suggest a change to UTS#39 rather than simply deviate from the standard.
I'd suggest that we do (a) immediately (recognizing that it will potentially impact other mixed-script labels that are currently accepted and displayed as Unicode IDNs, but the number of real-world examples likely to be affected should be small). To consider (b), I'll raise the status of Latin+UCAS at the Moderately Restrictive level for discussion in the Unicode Technical Committee. If the UTC agrees to make a change to Moderate, we could then consider reverting our default level.

Hmm. What's the timeline for a Unicode Technical Committee discussion? Given it's taken so long for someone to notice this, I would be surprised to see an epidemic of UCAS-based spoofing starting tomorrow.
If we want to switch to Highly Restrictive, we should try and get some data on how much impact there would be first. AIUI other browsers also picked that level, because www.<latin-bit>-<native-bit>.tld or similar is an acknowledged use case, and because of the commonality of Latin, many scripts/languages in practice borrow words or letters. But this is remembering discussions from a long time ago, so we should get data.

Well... I could raise the issue immediately on the UTC's internal mailing list, and see if anyone chimes in with comments (provided we're happy with bringing this up in a somewhat wider forum); depending on the response, that might give an early indication of what's likely to happen (or not).
The next actual UTC meeting is at the beginning of August, so we could ask for it to be on the agenda then.

I think we should start with the mailing list. Perhaps the line to take is: "We notice there's this 'except for Cyrillic and Greek' rule. Presumably those were picked because of the extensive overlap in character shapes with Latin. How might other scripts be considered for that list? What about Canadian Syllabics, for example?"
That's a bit better than "Hey, everyone, we're worried that Canadian Syllabics can be used for phishing..."

It turns out the latest proposed update to UTS#31, aimed at Unicode 10.0, drops the "aspirational scripts" category and merges them into "limited use":
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/tr31-26.html>
This will make the UCAS characters no longer eligible to be mixed with Latin in labels, per the "Moderately Restrictive" profile in UTS#39.
I'd suggest, therefore, that we go ahead and make such a change in nsIDNService, in anticipation of the upcoming Unicode changes.

Attached patch

[Treat Aspirational scripts the same as Restricted, in anticipation of UAX#31 update](attachment.cgi?id=8870470&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8870470&action=edit)

This is a minimal patch to just change how the Aspirational script characters are handled. Once Unicode 10 is released and we update all our data tables, etc., the IDTYPE\_ASPIRATIONAL value will go away altogether, but in the meantime this seems the simplest way to fix the issue, and minimizes any backporting risk.

Treat Aspirational scripts the same as Restricted, in anticipation of UAX#31 update
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The issue is potential domain spoofing; the patch arguably draws attention to the "Aspirational" scripts, which might lead someone to notice the possible "lookalike" characters there. Having noticed that, exploiting is as easy as registering a domain.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not really, it's positioned as an update to match forthcoming Unicode changes.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
ESR52 will need a slightly modified patch, but it is trivial to create.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Minimal risk, and covered by unit tests.

As mentioned in <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719199> [comment #31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1364283#c31 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security: disallow \"Canadian Syllabics\" unicode block from IDN domains"), the example domains cannot be registered due to Verisign's script mixing policy:
"It turned out that Verisign's script mixing policy does not allow Latin and Canadian syllabics. As a result, none of examples in this bug report (involving mixing Latin and Canadian syllabics) can be registered in any TLDs subject to Verisign's policy.
<https://www.verisign.com/en_US/channel-resources/domain-registry-products/idn/idn-policy/registration-rules/index.xhtml>
All code points within an IDN must come from the same Unicode script. This is done to prevent confusable code points from appearing in the same IDN.
<https://www.verisign.com/assets/idn/idn-canadian-aboriginal.html> does not list any of [a-z]. "
I never attempted to register any of the domains above as I was unaware of this policy. Attempting to register any of these domains results with an error "Parameter value policy error (IDN commingles multiple scripts)"
(using the first example above)
<https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=youtu%E1%96%AFe>
It appears that this is still register-able with certain ccTLD's, but that does significantly limit the scope of this issue.
Thanks,
Sam

re [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1364283#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security: disallow \"Canadian Syllabics\" unicode block from IDN domains"): moderately restrictive vs highly restrictive
> All code points within an IDN must come from the same Unicode script. This is done to prevent confusable code points from appearing in the same IDN.
A lot of TLDs have a similar policy. Armenia, Israel, Thai, India, Saudi Arabia do not allow mixing of their native scripts with Latin. They only allow a subset of characters in their native scripts and ASCII digits and hyphen. Exceptions are CJK TLDs. ICANN's per-language LRGs also acknowledge that.
So, using 'moderately restrictive' profile instead of 'highly restrictive' profile has little practical impact.
<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=726950> has more information I collected.
I can file a new bug to talk about 'moderately vs highly' restrictive profiles.

Hi, I intend to discuss this issue at a DEFCON (wall of sheep) talk next Friday 7/28. As information about this bug is public through [CVE-2017-5076](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5076) and the Firefox CVE ( <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2017-16/#﷒1>﷓ ) I do not see any problem with this, but I did want to give you a headsup as this issue is still labeled as restricted.

##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

## 1 [Introduction](#Introduction)

A common task facing an implementer of the Unicode Standard is the
provision of a parsing and/or lexing engine for identifiers, such as
programming language variables or domain names.
There are also realms where identifiers need to be defined with an extended set of
characters to align better with what end users expect, such as in
hashtags.

To assist in the standard treatment of identifiers in Unicode
character-based parsers and lexical analyzers, a set of
specifications is provided here as a
basis for parsing identifiers that contain Unicode characters. These specifications
include:

* [Default Identifiers](#Default_Identifier_Syntax): a
  recommended default for the definition of identifiers.
* [Immutable
  Identifiers](#Immutable_Identifier_Syntax): for environments that need an definition of
  identifiers that does not change across versions of Unicode.
* [Hashtag
  Identifiers](#hashtag_identifiers): for identifiers that need a broader set of
  characters, principally for hashtags.

These guidelines follow the typical pattern of identifier
syntax rules in common programming languages, by defining an ID\_Start
class and an ID\_Continue class and using a simple BNF rule for
identifiers based on those classes; however, the composition of those
classes is more complex and contains additional types of characters,
due to the universal scope of the Unicode Standard.

This annex also provides guidelines for the user of normalization and
case insensitivity with identifiers, expanding on a section that was
originally in Unicode Standard Annex #15, “Unicode Normalization
Forms” [[UAX15](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UAX15)].

The specification in this annex provides a definition of identifiers
that is guaranteed to be backward compatible with each successive
release of Unicode, but also allows any appropriate new Unicode
characters to become available in identifiers. In addition, Unicode
character properties for stable pattern syntax are provided. The
resulting pattern syntax is backward compatible *and* forward
compatible over future versions of the Unicode Standard. These
properties can either be used alone or in conjunction with the
identifier characters.

*Figure 1* shows the disjoint categories of code points defined
in this annex. (The sizes of the boxes are not to scale.)

Figure 1. [Code
Point Categories for Identifier Parsing](#Figure_Code_Point_Categories_for_Identifier_Parsing)

| ID\_Start Characters | Pattern\_Syntax Characters | Unassigned Code Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ID\_Nonstart Characters | Pattern\_White\_Space Characters |
| Other Assigned Code Points | |

The set consisting of the union of *ID\_Start* and *ID\_Nonstart*
characters is known as *Identifier Characters* and has the
property *ID\_Continue*. The *ID\_Nonstart* set is defined as
the set difference *ID\_Continue* minus *ID\_Start*: it is
not a formal Unicode property. While lexical rules are traditionally
expressed in terms of the latter, the discussion here is simplified
by referring to disjoint categories.

### 1.1 [Stability](#Stability)

There are certain features that developers can depend on for
stability:

* Identifier characters, Pattern\_Syntax characters, and
  Pattern\_White\_Space are disjoint: they will never overlap.
* The Identifier characters are always a superset of the
  ID\_Start characters.
* The Pattern\_Syntax characters and Pattern\_White\_Space
  characters are immutable and will not change over successive
  versions of Unicode.
* The ID\_Start and ID\_Nonstart characters may grow over time,
  either by the addition of new characters provided in a future
  version of Unicode or (in rare cases) by the addition of characters
  that were in Other.

In successive versions of Unicode, the only allowed changes of
characters from one of the above classes to another are those listed
with a plus sign (+) in *Table 1.*

Table 1. [Permitted
Changes in Future Versions](#Table_Permitted_Changes_in_Future_Versions)

|  | ID\_Start | ID\_Nonstart | Other Assigned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unassigned | **+** | **+** | **+** |
| Other Assigned | **+** | **+** |  |
| ID\_Nonstart | **+** |  |  |

The Unicode Consortium has formally adopted a stability policy on
identifiers. For more information, see [[Stability](../tr41/tr41-19.html#Stability)].

### 1.2 [Customization](#Customization)

Each programming language standard has its own identifier
syntax; different programming languages have different conventions
for the use of certain characters such as $, @, #, and \_ in
identifiers. To extend such a syntax to cover the full behavior of a
Unicode implementation, implementers may combine those specific rules
with the syntax and properties provided here.

Each programming language can define its identifier syntax as *relative*
to the Unicode identifier syntax, such as saying that identifiers are
defined by the Unicode properties, with the addition of “$”. By
addition or subtraction of a small set of language specific
characters, a programming language standard can easily track a
growing repertoire of Unicode characters in a compatible way. See
also *Section 2.5, [Backward
Compatibility](#Backward_Compatibility)*.

Similarly, each programming language can define its own
whitespace characters or syntax characters relative to the Unicode
Pattern\_White\_Space or Pattern\_Syntax characters, with some specified
set of additions or subtractions.

Systems that want to extend identifiers to encompass words used in
natural languages, or narrow identifiers for security may do so as
described in *Section 2.3, [Layout and Format
Control Characters](#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters)*, *Section 2.4, [Specific Character
Adjustments](#Specific_Character_Adjustments)*, and *Section 5, [Normalization and Case](#normalization_and_case)*.

To preserve the disjoint nature of the categories illustrated in *Figure
1*, any character *added* to one of the categories must be *subtracted*
from the others.

> **Note:** In many cases there are important
> security implications that may require additional constraints on
> identifiers. For more information, see [[UTR36](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UTR36)].

### 1.3 [Display Format](#Display_Format)

Implementations may use a format for *displaying* identifiers
that differs from the internal form used to *compare*
identifiers. For example, an implementation might display format what
the user has entered, but use a normalized format for comparison.
Examples of this include:

> **Case.** The display format retains case differences,
> but the comparison format erases them by using Case\_Folding. Thus
> “A” and its lowercase variant “a” would be treated as the same
> identifier internally, even though they may have been input
> differently and may display differently.
>
> **Variants.** The display format retains variant
> distinctions, such as halfwidth versus fullwidth forms, or between
> variation sequences and their base characters, but the comparison
> format erases them by using NFKC\_Case\_Folding. Thus “A” and its
> full-width variant “Ａ” would be treated as the same identifier
> internally, even though they may have been input differently and may

* [R8. Hashtag Identifiers](#R8)

## 2 [Default Identifiers](#Default_Identifier_Syntax)

The formal syntax provided here captures the general intent
that an identifier consists of a string of characters beginning with
a letter or an ideograph, and followed by any number of letters,
ideographs, digits, or underscores. It provides a definition of
identifiers that is guaranteed to be backward compatible with each
successive release of Unicode, but also adds any appropriate new
Unicode characters.

The formulations allow for extensions, also
known as *profiles*. That is, the particular set of code points for
each category used by the syntax can be customized according to the
requirements of the environment.

If such extensions include characters from Pattern\_White\_Space or
Pattern\_Syntax, then such identifiers do not conform to an unmodified
[R3. Pattern\_White\_Space and Pattern\_Syntax
Characters](#R3). However, such extensions may often be necessary. For
example, Java and C++ identifiers include ‘$’, which is a
Pattern\_Syntax character.

***[UAX31-D1](#D1)**. **Default
Identifier Syntax:***

> `<Identifier> := <Start> <Continue>*
> (<Medial> <Continue>+)*`

Identifiers are defined by assigning the
sets of lexical classes defined as properties in the Unicode
Character Database [[UAX44](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UAX44)].
These properties are shown in *Table 2*. The
first column shows the property name, whose values are defined in
the UCD. The second column provides a general description of the
coverage for the associated class, the derivational relationship
between the ID properties and the XID properties, and an associated
set notation for the class.

Table 2. [Properties for Lexical Classes for
Identifiers](#Table_Lexical_Classes_for_Identifiers)

| Properties | General Description of Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `ID_Start` | `ID_Start` characters are derived from the Unicode General\_Category of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, titlecase letters, modifier letters, other letters, letter numbers, plus Other\_ID\_Start, minus Pattern\_Syntax and Pattern\_White\_Space code points. In set notation: [[:L:][:Nl:][:Other\_ID\_Start:]--[:Pattern\_Syntax:]--[:Pattern\_White\_Space:]] |
| `XID_Start` | `XID_Start` characters are derived from `ID_Start` as per *Section 5.1, [NFKC Modifications](#NFKC_Modifications)*. |
| `ID_Continue` | `ID_Continue` characters include ID\_Start characters, plus characters having the Unicode General\_Category of nonspacing marks, spacing combining marks, decimal number, connector punctuation, plus Other\_ID\_Continue , minus Pattern\_Syntax and Pattern\_White\_Space code points. In set notation: [[:ID\_Start:][:Mn:][:Mc:][:Nd:][:Pc:][:Other\_ID\_Continue:]--[:Pattern\_Syntax:]--[:Pattern\_White\_Space:]] |
| `XID_Continue` | `XID_Continue` characters are derived from `ID_Continue` as per *Section 5.1, [NFKC Modifications](#NFKC_Modifications)*.  `XID_Continue` characters are also known simply as *Identifier Characters*, because they are a superset of the `XID_Start` characters. |

Note that “other letters” includes ideographs. For more about the
stability extensions, see *Section 2.5 [Backward Compatibility](#Backward_Compatibility)*.

The innovations in the identifier syntax to cover the Unicode
Standard include the following:

* Incorporation of proper handling of combining marks.
* Allowance for layout and format control characters, which
  should be ignored when parsing identifiers.

The XID\_Start and XID\_Continue properties are improved lexical
classes that incorporate the changes described in *Section 5.1,
[NFKC Modifications](#NFKC_Modifications)*. They are recommended for most purposes, especially for security,
over the original ID\_Start and ID\_Continue properties.

***[UAX31-R1](#R1)**. **Default
Identifiers:**To meet this requirement, to determine whether a string
is an identifier an implementation shall use definition [UAX31-D1](#D1), setting Start and
Continue to the properties XID\_Start and XID\_Continue, respectively, and leaving Medial empty.*

* *Alternatively, it shall declare that it uses a **profile**
  and define that profile with a precise specification of the
  characters that are added to or removed from Start,
  Continue, and Medial and/or provide a list of additional
  constraints on identifiers.*

One such profile may
be to use the contents of ID\_Start and ID\_Continue in place of
XID\_Start and XID\_Continue, for backward compatibility.

Another such profile would be to include some set of
the optional characters, for example:

* *Start := XID\_Start, plus some characters
  from [Table 3](#Table_Optional_Start)*
* *Continue := Start + XID\_Continue, plus some
  characters from [Table 3b](#Table_Optional_Continue)*
* *Medial := some characters from [Table 3a](#Table_Optional_Medial)*

***[UAX31-R1a](#R1a)**. **Restricted
Format Characters:** To meet this requirement, an implementation
shall define a profile for [UAX31-R1](#R1) which allows format
characters as described in Section 2.3, [Layout and Format
Control Characters](#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters).*

* *An implementation may further restrict the context
  for ZWJ or ZWNJ, such as by limiting the scripts allowed
  or limiting the occurrence of ZWJ or ZWNJ to specific character
  combinations, if a clear specification for such a further
  restriction is supplied.*

***[UAX31-R1b](#R1b)**. **Stable
Identifiers:** To meet this requirement, an implementation shall
guarantee that identifiers are stable across versions of the Unicode
Standard: that is, once a string qualifies as an identifier, it does
so in all future versions.*

> **Note:** The UAX31-R1b requirement is typically achieved by using
> grandfathered characters. See Section 2.5, [Backward Compatibility](#Backward_Compatibility).
> Where profiles are allowed,
> management of those profiles may also be required to guarantee backwards
> compatibility. Typically such management also uses grandfathered characters.

### 2.1 [Combining Marks](#Combining_Marks)

Combining marks are accounted for in identifier syntax: a composed
character sequence consisting of a base character followed by any
number of combining marks is valid in an identifier. Combining marks
are required in the representation of many languages, and the
conformance rules in *Chapter 3, Conformance*, of [[Unicode](../tr41/tr41-19.html#Unicode)] require the
interpretation of canonical-equivalent character sequences. The
simplest way to do this is to require identifiers in the NFC format
(or transform them into that format); see *Section 5, [Normalization and Case](#normalization_and_case)*.

Enclosing combining marks (such as U+20DD..U+20E0) are excluded from
the definition of the

lexical class
`ID_Continue`
, because the composite characters that result from their composition
with letters are themselves not normally considered valid
constituents of these identifiers.

### 2.2 [Modifier Letters](#Modifier_Letters)

Modifier letters (General\_Category=Lm) are also included in the
definition of the syntax classes for identifiers. Modifier letters
are often part of natural language orthographies and are useful for
making word-like identifiers in formal languages. On the other hand,
modifier symbols (General\_Category=Sk), which are seldom a part of
language orthographies, are excluded from identifiers. For more
discussion of modifier letters and how they function, see [[Unicode](../tr41/tr41-19.html#Unicode)].

Implementations that tailor identifier syntax for special
purposes may wish to take special note of modifier letters, as in
some cases modifier letters have appearances, such as raised commas,
which may be confused with common syntax characters such as quotation
marks.

### 2.3 [Layout and Format Control Characters](#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters)

Certain Unicode characters are known as
Default\_Ignorable\_Code\_Points. These include variation selectors and
characters used to control joining behavior, bidirectional ordering
control, and alternative formats for display (having the
General\_Category value of Cf). The recommendation is to permit them
in identifiers only in special cases, listed below. The use of
default-ignorable characters in identifiers is problematical, first
because the effects they represent are stylistic or otherwise out of
scope for identifiers, and second because the characters themselves
often have no visible display. It is also possible to misapply these
characters such that users can create strings that look the same but
actually contain different characters, which can create security
problems. In such environments, identifiers should also be limited to
characters that are case-folded and normalized with the NFKC\_Casefold
operation. For more information, see *Section 5, [Normalization and Case](#normalization_and_case)* and *UTR
#36: Unicode Security Considerations* [[UTR36](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UTR36)].

Variation selectors, in particular, including standardized variants
and sequences from the Ideographic Variation Database, are not
included in the default identifier syntax. These are subject to the
same considerations as for other Default\_Ignorable\_Code\_Points listed
above. Because variation selectors request a difference in display
but do not guarantee it, they do not work well in general-purpose
identifiers. The NFKC\_Casefold operation can be used to remove them,
along with other Default\_Ignorable\_Code\_Points. However, in some
environments it may be useful to retain variation sequences in the
display form for identifiers. For more information, see *Section
1.3, [Display Format](#Display_Format)*.

For the above reasons, default-ignorable characters are normally
excluded from Unicode identifiers. However, visible distinctions
created by certain format characters (particularly the *Join\_Control
characters*) are necessary in certain languages. A blanket exclusion
of these characters makes it impossible to create identifiers with
the correct visual appearance for common words or phrases in those
languages.

Identifier systems that attempt to provide more natural
representations of terms in "modern, customary usage"
should allow these characters in input and display, but limit them to
contexts in which they are necessary. The term *modern
customary usage* includes characters that are in common use in
newspapers, journals, lay publications; on street signs; in
commercial signage; and as part of common geographic names and
company names, and so on. It does not include technical or academic
usage such as in mathematical expressions, using archaic scripts or
words, or pedagogical use (such as illustration of half-forms or
joining forms in isolation), or liturgical use.

The goals for such a restriction of format characters to
particular contexts are to:

* Allow the use of these characters where required in normal
  text
* Exclude as many cases as possible where no visible
  distinction results
* Be simple enough to be easily implemented with standard
  mechanisms such as regular expressions

Thus in such circumstances, an implementation should allow the
following Join\_Control characters in the limited contexts specified
in **[A1](#A1)**, **[A2](#A2)**, and **[B](#B)** below.

> U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (ZWNJ)
>  U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER
> (ZWJ)

There are also two global conditions incorporated in each of **[A1](#A1)**, **[A2](#A2)**, and **[B](#B)**:

* **Script Restriction.** In each of the following cases,
  the specified sequence must only consist of characters from a single
  script (after ignoring *Common* and *Inherited* script
  characters).
* **Normalization.** In each of the following cases, the
  specified sequence must be in NFC format. (To test an identifier
  that is not required to be in NFC, first transform into NFC format
  and then test the condition.)

**[A1](#A1). Allow ZWNJ in the
following context:**

**Breaking a cursive connection.**  That is, in the context based
on the Joining\_Type property, consisting of:

* A Left-Joining or Dual-Joining character, followed by zero
  or more Transparent characters, followed by a ZWNJ, followed by zero
  or more Transparent characters, followed by a Right-Joining or
  Dual-Joining character

This corresponds to the following regular expression (in Perl-style
syntax): **/$LJ $T\* ZWNJ $T\* $RJ/**
 where:

> $T = [:Joining\_Type=Transparent:]
>  $RJ =
> [[:Joining\_Type=Dual\_Joining:][:Joining\_Type=Right\_Joining:]]
>
> $LJ = [[:Joining\_Type=Dual\_Joining:][:Joining\_Type=Left\_Joining:]]

For example, consider Farsi <*Noon, Alef, Meem, Heh, Alef,
Farsi Yeh*>. Without a ZWNJ, it translates to "names",
as shown in the first row; with a ZWNJ between Heh and Alef, it means
"a letter", as shown in the second row of *Figure 2*.

ZWNJ](#Figure_Farsi_Example_with_ZWNJ)

| Appearance | Code Points | Abbreviated Names |
| --- | --- | --- |
| diagram1 | 0646 + 0627 + 0645 + 0647 + 0627 + 06CC | NOON + ALEF + MEEM + HEH + ALEF + FARSI YEH |
| diagram2 | 0646 + 0627 + 0645 + 0647 + 200C + 0627 + 06CC | NOON + ALEF + MEEM + HEH + ZWNJ + ALEF + FARSI YEH |

**[A2](#A2). Allow ZWNJ in the
following context:**

**In a conjunct context.** That is, a sequence of the form:

* A Letter, followed by a Virama, followed by a ZWNJ

This corresponds to the following regular expression (in Perl-style
syntax): **/$L $V ZWNJ/**
 where:

> $L = [:General\_Category=Letter:]
>  $V =
> [:Canonical\_Combining\_Class=Virama:]

For example, the Malayalam word for *eyewitness* is shown in *Figure
3*. The form without the ZWNJ in the second row is incorrect in this
case.

**[B](#B). Allow ZWJ in the
following context:**

**In a conjunct context.** That is, a sequence of the form:

* A Letter, followed by a Virama, followed by a ZWJ

This corresponds to the following regular expression (in Perl-style
syntax):  **/$L $V ZWJ/**
 where:

> $L= [:General\_Category=Letter:]
>  $V =
> [:Canonical\_Combining\_Class=Virama:]

For example, the Sinhala word for the country 'Sri Lanka' is
shown in the first row of *Figure 4*, which uses both a space
character and a ZWJ. Removing the space results in the text shown in
the second row of *Figure 4*, which is still legible, but
removing the ZWJ completely modifies the appearance of the
'Sri' cluster and results in the unacceptable text appearance
shown in the third row of *Figure 4*.

#### 2.3.1 [Limitations](#Limitations)

While the restrictions in **[A1](#A1)**, **[A2](#A2)**, and **[B](#B)** greatly
limit visual confusability, they do not prevent it. For example,
because Tamil only uses a Join\_Control character in one specific
case, most of the sequences these rules allow in Tamil are, in fact,
visually confusable. Therefore based on their knowledge of the script
concerned, implementations may choose to have tighter restrictions
than specified below. There are also cases where a joiner preceding a
virama makes a visual distinction in some scripts. It is currently
unclear whether this distinction is important enough in identifiers
to warrant retention of a joiner. For more information, see UTR #36:
*Unicode Security Considerations* [[UTR36](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UTR36)].

***Performance.*** Parsing identifiers can be a
performance-sensitive task. However, these characters are quite rare
in practice, thus the regular expressions (or equivalent processing)
only rarely would need to be invoked. Thus these tests should not add
any significant performance cost overall.

***Comparison.*** Typically the identifiers with and
without these characters should compare as equivalent, to prevent
security issues. See *Section 2.4, [Specific Character
Adjustments](#Specific_Character_Adjustments)*.

### 2.4 [Specific Character Adjustments](#Specific_Character_Adjustments)

Specific identifier syntaxes can be treated as tailorings (or *profiles*)
of the generic syntax based on character properties. For example, SQL
identifiers allow an underscore as an identifier continue, but not as
an identifier start; C identifiers allow an underscore as either an
identifier continue or an identifier start. Specific languages may
also want to exclude the characters that have a Decomposition\_Type
other than Canonical or None, or to exclude some subset of those,
such as those with a Decomposition\_Type equal to Font.

There are circumstances in which identifiers are expected to more
fully encompass words or phrases used in natural languages. For
example, it is recommended that U+00B7 (·) MIDDLE DOT be allowed in
medial positions in natural-language identifiers such as hashtags or
search terms, because it is required for grammatical Catalan. For related issues about MIDDLE DOT, see *Section 5, [Normalization and Case](#normalization_and_case)*.

For more natural-language identifiers, a profile should allow the
characters in *[Table 3](#Table_Optional_Start)*, *[Table
3a](#Table_Optional_Medial)*, and *[Table 3b](#Table_Optional_Continue)* in
identifiers, unless there are compelling reasons not to. Most additions to identifiers are restricted
to medial positions, such as U+00B7 ( · ) MIDDLE DOT, which is not needed as a
trailing character in Catalan. These are listed in *[Table 3a](#Table_Optional_Medial)*. A few characters can
also occur in final positions, and are listed in *[Table 3b](#Table_Optional_Continue)*. The contents of these
tables may overlap.

In some environments even spaces and @
are allowed in identifiers, such as in SQL: *SELECT \* FROM
Employee Pension.*

The characters marked with an asterisk in *[Table
3a](#Table_Optional_Medial)* and *[Table 3b](#Table_Optional_Continue)* are Join\_Control characters, discussed in *Section 2.3, [Layout and Format
Control Characters](#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters)*.

In UnicodeSet syntax, the characters in these tables are:

* Table 3: [[\$\_]](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[\$_])
* Table 3a: [['\-.\:·֊״་‌‐’‧゠・]](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=['\-.\:·֊״་‌‐’‧゠・])
* Table 3b: [[\u200D ׳]](http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[\u200D ׳])

In identifiers that allow for unnormalized characters, the
compatibility equivalents of the characters listed in *[Table 3](#Table_Optional_Start)*,
*[Table 3a](#Table_Optional_Medial)*, and *[Table 3b](#Table_Optional_Continue)*
may also be appropriate.

For more information on characters that may occur in words, and those
that may be used in name validation, see Section 4, *Word Boundaries*, in [[UAX29](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UAX29)].

Some characters are not in modern customary use, and thus
implementations may want to exclude them from identifiers. These
include characters in historic and obsolete scripts, scripts used
mostly liturgically, and regional scripts used only in very small
communities or with very limited current usage. The set of characters
in [*Table
4, Candidate Characters for Exclusion from Identifiers*](#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers) provides
candidates of these, plus some inappropriate technical blocks.

As of Unicode 10.0, there is no longer a distinction between aspirational use and limited use scripts, as this has not proven to be productive for the derivation of identifier-related classes used in security profiles. (See *UTS #39, Unicode Security Mechanisms* [[UTR39](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UTS39)].) Thus the Aspirational scripts in *[Table
6, Aspirational Use Scripts](#Aspirational_Use_Scripts)* have been recategorized as Limited Use and moved to *[Table 7, Limited Use Scripts](#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts)*.

Modern scripts that are in more limited use are listed in *[Table 7, Limited Use Scripts](#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts)*.
To avoid security issues, some implementations may wish to disallow
the limited-use scripts in identifiers. For more information on
usage, see the Unicode Locale project [[CLDR](../tr41/tr41-19.html#CLDR)].

This is the recommendation as of the current version of Unicode; as
new scripts are added to future versions of Unicode, characters and scripts may
be added to Tables *[4](#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers)*,
*[5](#Table_Recommended_Scripts)*, *[6](#Aspirational_Use_Scripts)*, and *[7](#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts)*. Characters may also be
moved from one table to another as more information becomes
available.

There are a few special cases:

* The Common and Inherited script values
  [[:script=Zyyy:][:script=Zinh:]] are used widely with other scripts,
  rather than being scripts per se. See also the Script\_Extensions
  property in the Unicode Character Database [[UAX44](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UAX44)].
* The Unknown script [:script=Zzzz:] is used for Unassigned
  characters.
* Braille [:script=Brai:] consists only of symbols
* Katakana\_Or\_Hiragana [:script=Hrkt:] is empty (used
  historically in Unicode, but no longer.)
* With respect to the scripts Balinese, Cham, Ol Chiki, Vai,
  Kayah Li, and Saurashtra, there may be large communities of people
  speaking an associated language, but the script itself is not not in
  widespread use. However, there are significant revival efforts.
* Bopomofo is used primarily in education.

For programming language identifiers, normalization and case have a
number of important implications. For a discussion of these issues,
see *Section 5, [Normalization
and Case](#normalization_and_case)*.

### 2.5 [Backward Compatibility](#Backward_Compatibility)

Unicode General\_Category values are kept as stable as possible, but
they can change across versions of the Unicode Standard. The bulk of
the characters having a given value are determined by other
properties, and the coverage expands in the future according to the
assignment of those properties. In addition, the Other\_ID\_Start
property provides a small list of characters that qualified as
ID\_Start characters in some previous version of Unicode solely on the
basis of their General\_Category properties, but that no longer
qualify in the current version. These are called *grandfathered*
characters.

The Other\_ID\_Start property includes characters such as the
following:

> U+2118 ( ℘ ) SCRIPT CAPITAL P
>  U+212E ( ℮ ) ESTIMATED SYMBOL
>
> U+309B ( ゛ ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA VOICED SOUND MARK
>  U+309C ( ゜
> ) KATAKANA-HIRAGANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK

Similarly, the Other\_ID\_Continue property adds a small list of
characters that qualified as ID\_Continue characters in some previous
version of Unicode solely on the basis of their General\_Category
properties, but that no longer qualify in the current version.

The Other\_ID\_Continue property includes characters such as the
following:

> U+1369 ETHIOPIC DIGIT ONE...U+1371 ETHIOPIC DIGIT NINE
>
> U+00B7 ( · ) MIDDLE DOT
>  U+0387 ( · ) GREEK ANO TELEIA
>
> U+19DA ( ᧚ ) NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE

The exact list of characters covered by the Other\_ID\_Start and
Other\_ID\_Continue properties depends on the version of Unicode. For
more information, see Unicode Standard Annex #44, “Unicode Character
Database” [[UAX44](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UAX44)].

The Other\_ID\_Start and Other\_ID\_Continue properties are thus
designed to ensure that the Unicode identifier specification is
backward compatible. Any sequence of characters that qualified as an
identifier in some version of Unicode will continue to qualify as an
identifier in future versions.

If a specification tailors the Unicode recommendations for
identifiers, then this technique can also be used to maintain
backwards compatibility across versions.

## 3 [Immutable Identifiers](#Immutable_Identifier_Syntax)

The disadvantage of working with the lexical classes defined
previously is the storage space needed for the detailed definitions,
plus the fact that with each new version of the Unicode Standard new
characters are added, which an existing parser would not be able to
recognize. In other words, the recommendations based on that table
are not upwardly compatible.

This problem can be addressed by turning the question around.
Instead of defining the set of code points that are allowed, define a
small, fixed set of code points that are reserved for syntactic use
and allow everything else (including unassigned code points) as part
of an identifier. All parsers written to this specification would
behave the same way for all versions of the Unicode Standard, because
the classification of code points is fixed forever.

The drawback of this method is that it allows “nonsense” to be part
of identifiers because the concerns of lexical classification and of
human intelligibility are separated. Human intelligibility can,
however, be addressed by other means, such as usage guidelines that
encourage a restriction to meaningful terms for identifiers. For an
example of such guidelines, see the XML specification by the W3C,
Version 1.0 5th Edition or later [[XML](../tr41/tr41-19.html#XML)].

By increasing the set of disallowed characters, a reasonably
intuitive recommendation for identifiers can be achieved. This
approach uses the full specification of identifier classes, as of a
particular version of the Unicode Standard, and permanently disallows
any characters not recommended in that version for inclusion in
identifiers. All code points unassigned as of that version would be
allowed in identifiers, so that any future additions to the standard
would already be accounted for. This approach ensures both upwardly
compatible identifier stability and a reasonable division of
characters into those that do and do not make human sense as part of
identifiers.

With or without such fine-tuning, such a compromise approach
still incurs the expense of implementing large lists of code points.
While they no longer change over time, it is a matter of choice
whether the benefit of enforcing somewhat word-like identifiers
justifies their cost.

Alternatively, one can use the properties described below and
allow all sequences of characters to be identifiers that are neither
Pattern\_Syntax nor Pattern\_White\_Space. This has the advantage of
simplicity and small tables, but allows many more “unnatural”
identifiers.

***[UAX31-R2](#R2)**.
**Immutable Identifiers:** To meet this requirement,
an implementation shall define identifiers to be any non-empty
string of characters that contains no character having any of the
following property values:*

* Pattern\_White\_Space=True
* Pattern\_Syntax=True
* General\_Category=Private\_Use, Surrogate, or Control
* Noncharacter\_Code\_Point=True

*Alternatively, it shall declare that it uses a **profile**
and define that profile with a precise specification of the
characters that are added to or removed from the sets of code points
defined by these properties.*

In its profile, a specification can define identifiers to be
more in accordance with the Unicode identifier definitions at the
time the profile is adopted, while still allowing for strict
immutability. For example, an implementation adopting a profile after
a particular version of Unicode is released (such as Unicode 5.0)
could define the profile as follows:

1. All characters satisfying *[UAX31-R1
   Default Identifiers](#R1)* according to Unicode 5.0
2. Plus all code points unassigned in Unicode 5.0 that do not
   have the property values specified in
   *[UAX31-R2 Immutable Identifiers](#R2)*.

This technique allows identifiers to have a more natural
format—excluding symbols and punctuation already defined—yet also
provides absolute code point immutability.

Immutable identifiers are intended for those cases (like XML) that cannot update across versions of Unicode, and do not require information about normalization form, or properties such as General\_Category and Script. Immutable identifers that allow unassigned characters cannot provide for normalization forms or these properties, which means that they:

* cannot be compared for NFC, NFKC, or case-insensitive equality
* are unsuitable for restrictions such as those in UTS #39

For best practice, a profile disallowing unassigned characters should be provided where possible.

Specifications should also include guidelines and recommendations for
those creating new identifiers. Although
*[UAX31-R2 Immutable Identifiers](#R2)* permits a wide range of
characters, as a best practice identifiers should be in the format
NFKC, without using any unassigned characters. For more information
on NFKC, see Unicode Standard Annex #15, “Unicode Normalization
Forms” [[UAX15](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UAX15)].

## 4 [Pattern Syntax](#Pattern_Syntax)

There are many circumstances where software interprets patterns
that are a mixture of literal characters, whitespace, and syntax
characters. Examples include regular expressions, Java collation
rules, Excel or ICU number formats, and many others. In the past,
regular expressions and other formal languages have been forced to
use clumsy combinations of ASCII characters for their syntax. As
Unicode becomes ubiquitous, some of these will start to use non-ASCII
characters for their syntax: first as more readable optional
alternatives, then eventually as the standard syntax.

For forward and backward compatibility, it is advantageous to have a
fixed set of whitespace and syntax code points for use in patterns.
This follows the recommendations that the Unicode Consortium has made
regarding completely stable identifiers, and the practice that is
seen in XML 1.0, 5th Edition or later [[XML](../tr41/tr41-19.html#XML)]. (In particular, the
Unicode Consortium is committed to not allocating characters suitable
for identifiers in the range U+2190..U+2BFF, which is being used by
XML 1.0, 5th Edition.)

With a fixed set of whitespace and syntax code points, a
pattern language can then have a policy requiring all possible syntax
characters (even ones currently unused) to be quoted if they are
literals. Using this policy preserves the freedom to extend the
syntax in the future by using those characters. Past patterns on
future systems will always work; future patterns on past systems will
signal an error instead of silently producing the wrong results.
Consider the following scenario, for example.

> In version 1.0 of program X, '≈' is a reserved syntax
> character; that is, it does not perform an operation, and it needs
> to be quoted. In this example, '\' *quotes* the next
> character; that is, it causes it to be treated as a literal instead
> of a syntax character. In version 2.0 of program X, '≈' is
> given a real meaning—for example, “uppercase the subsequent
> characters”.
>
> * The pattern abc...\≈...xyz works on both versions 1.0 and
>   2.0, and refers to the literal character because it is quoted in
>   both cases.
> * The pattern abc...≈...xyz works on version 2.0 and
>   uppercases the following characters. On version 1.0, the engine
>   (rightfully) has no idea what to do with ≈. Rather than silently
>   fail (by ignoring ≈ or turning it into a literal), it has the
>   opportunity to signal an error.

As of Unicode 4.1, two Unicode character properties are defined
to provide for stable syntax: Pattern\_White\_Space and
Pattern\_Syntax.  Particular pattern languages may, of course,
override these recommendations, for example, by adding or removing
other characters for compatibility with ASCII usage.

For stability, the values of these properties are absolutely
invariant, not changing with successive versions of Unicode. Of
course, this does not limit the ability of the Unicode Standard to
encode more symbol or whitespace characters, but the syntax and
whitespace code points recommended for use in patterns will not
change.

When *generating* rules or patterns, all whitespace and syntax
code points that are to be literals require quoting, using whatever
quoting mechanism is available. For readability, it is recommended
practice to quote or escape all literal whitespace and default
ignorable code points as well.

> Consider the following example, where the items in angle
> brackets indicate literal characters:
>
> > a<SPACE>b → x<ZERO WIDTH SPACE>y  +
> > z;
>
> Because <SPACE> is a Pattern\_White\_Space character, it
> requires quoting. Because <ZERO WIDTH SPACE> is a default
> ignorable character, it should also be quoted for readability. So in
> this example, if \uXXXX is used for a code point literal, but is
> resolved before quoting, and if single quotes are used for quoting,
> this example might be expressed as:
>
> > 'a\u0020b' → 'x\u200By' + z;

***[UAX31-R3](#R3)**. **Pattern\_White\_Space
and Pattern\_Syntax Characters:** To meet this requirement, an
implementation shall use Pattern\_White\_Space characters as all and
only those characters interpreted as whitespace in parsing, and
shall use Pattern\_Syntax characters as all and only those characters
with syntactic use.*

*Alternatively, it shall declare that it uses a **profile**
and define that profile with a precise specification of the
characters that are added to or removed from the sets of code points
defined by these properties.*

> **Note:** When meeting this requirement, all characters except
> those that have the Pattern\_White\_Space or Pattern\_Syntax properties
> are available for use as identifiers or literals.

## 5 [Normalization and Case](#normalization_and_case)

This section discusses issues that must be taken into account
when considering normalization and case folding of identifiers in
programming languages or scripting languages. Using normalization
avoids many problems where apparently identical identifiers are not
treated equivalently. Such problems can appear both during
compilation and during linking—in particular across different
programming languages. To avoid such problems, programming languages
can normalize identifiers before storing or comparing them. Generally
if the programming language has case-sensitive identifiers, then
Normalization Form C is appropriate; whereas, if the programming
language has case-insensitive identifiers, then Normalization Form KC
is more appropriate.

Implementations that take normalization and case into account
have two choices: to treat variants as equivalent, or to disallow
variants.

***[UAX31-R4](#R4)**. **Equivalent
Normalized Identifiers:** To meet this requirement, an implementation
shall specify the Normalization Form and shall provide a precise
specification of the characters that are excluded from
normalization, if any. If the Normalization Form is NFKC, the
implementation shall apply the modifications in Section 5.1, [NFKC Modifications](#NFKC_Modifications), given by the
properties XID\_Start and XID\_Continue. Except for identifiers
containing excluded characters, any two identifiers that have the
same Normalization Form shall be treated as equivalent by the
implementation.*

***[UAX31-R5](#R5)**. **Equivalent
Case-Insensitive Identifiers:** To meet this requirement, an
implementation shall specify either simple or full case folding, and
adhere to the Unicode specification for that folding. Any two
identifiers that have the same case-folded form shall be treated as
equivalent by the implementation.*

***[UAX31-R6](#R6)**. **Filtered
Normalized Identifiers:** To meet this requirement, an implementation
shall specify the Normalization Form and shall provide a precise
specification of the characters that are excluded from
normalization, if any. If the Normalization Form is NFKC, the
implementation shall apply the modifications in Section 5.1, [NFKC Modifications](#NFKC_Modifications), given by the
properties XID\_Start and XID\_Continue. Except for identifiers
containing excluded characters, allowed identifiers must be in the
specified Normalization Form.*

> **Note:** For requirement UAX31-R6, filtering involves disallowing any
> characters in the set [:NFKC\_QuickCheck=No:], or equivalently,
> disallowing [:^isNFKC:].

***[UAX31-R7](#R7)**. **Filtered
Case-Insensitive Identifiers:** To meet this requirement, an
implementation shall specify either simple or full case folding, and
adhere to the Unicode specification for that folding. Except for
identifiers containing excluded characters, allowed identifiers must
be in the specified Normalization Form.*

> **Note:** For requirement UAX31-R7 with full case folding, filtering
> involves disallowing any characters in the set [:^isCasefolded:].

As of Unicode 5.2, an additional string transform is available for
use in matching identifiers:
`toNFKC_Casefold(S)`
. See **UAX31-R5** in *Section 3.13, Default Case Algorithms* in
[[Unicode](../tr41/tr41-19.html#Unicode)]. That operation
case folds and normalizes a string, and also removes default
ignorable code points. It can be used to support an implementation of
*Equivalent Case and Compatibility-Insensitive Identifiers*.
There is a corresponding boolean property,
Changes\_When\_NFKC\_Casefolded, which can be used to support an
implementation of *Filtered Case and Compatibility-Insensitive
Identifiers*. The NFKC\_Casefold character mapping property and the
Changes\_When\_NFKC\_Casefolded property are described in Unicode
Standard Annex #44, "Unicode Character Database" [[UAX44](../tr41/tr41-19.html#UAX44)].

> **Note:** In mathematically oriented programming languages that
> make distinctive use of the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols, such
> as U+1D400 MATHEMATICAL BOLD CAPITAL A, an application of NFKC must
> filter characters to exclude characters with the property value
> Decomposition\_Type=Font.

### 5.1 [NFKC Modifications](#NFKC_Modifications)

Where programming languages are using NFKC to fold differences
between characters, they need the following modifications of the
identifier syntax from the Unicode Standard to deal with the
idiosyncrasies of a small number of characters. These modifications
are reflected in the XID\_Start and XID\_Continue properties.

#### 5.1.1 [Modifications for Characters that Behave Like Combining Marks](#Combining_Mark_Mods)

Certain characters are not formally combining characters,
although they behave in most respects as if they were. In most cases,
the mismatch does not cause a problem, but when these characters have
compatibility decompositions, they can cause identifiers not to be
closed under Normalization Form KC. In particular, the following four
characters are included in XID\_Continue and not XID\_Start:

* U+0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM
* U+0EB3 LAO VOWEL SIGN AM
* U+FF9E HALFWIDTH KATAKANA VOICED SOUND MARK
* U+FF9F HALFWIDTH KATAKANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK

#### 5.1.2 [Modifications for Irregularly Decomposing Characters](#Irreg_Decomp_Mods)

U+037A GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI and certain Arabic presentation
forms have irregular compatibility decompositions and are excluded
from both XID\_Start and XID\_Continue. It is recommended that all
Arabic presentation forms be excluded from identifiers in any event,
although only a few of them must be excluded for normalization to
guarantee identifier closure.

#### 5.1.3 [Identifier Closure Under Normalization](#Identifier_Closure)

With these amendments to the identifier syntax, all identifiers are
closed under all four Normalization Forms. This means that for any
string S, the implications shown in *Figure 5* hold.

Figure 5. [Normalization Closure](#Figure_Normalization_Closure)

| `isIdentifier(S)` → | `isIdentifier(toNFD(S)) isIdentifier(toNFC(S)) isIdentifier(toNFKD(S)) isIdentifier(toNFKC(S))` |
| --- | --- |

Identifiers are also closed under case operations. For any string S
(with exceptions involving a single character), the implications
shown in *Figure 6* hold.

Figure 6. [Case Closure](#Figure_Case_Closure)

| `isIdentifier(S)` → | `isIdentifier(toLowercase(S)) isIdentifier(toUppercase(S)) isIdentifier(toFoldedcase(S))` |
| --- | --- |

The one exception for casing is U+0345 COMBINING GREEK
YPOGEGRAMMENI. In the very unusual case that U+0345 is at the start
of S, U+0345 is not in XID\_Start, but its uppercase and case-folded
versions are. In practice, this is not a problem because of the way
normalization is used with identifiers.

The reverse implication is true for canonical equivalence but *not*
true in the case of compatibility equivalence:

Figure 7. [Reverse
Normalization Closure](#Figure_Reverse_Normalization_Closure)

| `isIdentifier(toNFD(S)) isIdentifier(toNFC(S))` | → `isIdentifier(S)` |
| --- | --- |
| `isIdentifier(toNFKD(S)) isIdentifier(toNFKC(S))` | ↛ `isIdentifier(S)` |

There are many characters for which the reverse implication is not
true for compatibility equivalence, because there are many characters
counting as symbols or non-decimal numbers—and thus outside of
identifiers—whose compatibility equivalents are letters or decimal
numbers and thus in identifiers. Some examples are shown in *[Table
8](#Figure_Compatibility_Equivalents_to_Letters_or_Decimal_Numbers)*.

Table 8. [Compatibility Equivalents to Letters or Decimal Numbers](#Figure_Compatibility_Equivalents_to_Letters_or_Decimal_Numbers)

| Code Points | GC | Samples | Names |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2070 | No | ⁰ | SUPERSCRIPT ZERO |
| 20A8 | Sc | ₨ | RUPEE SIGN |
| 2116 | So | № | NUMERO SIGN |
| 2120..2122 | So | ℠..™ | SERVICE MARK..TRADE MARK SIGN |
| 2460..2473 | No | ①..⑳ | CIRCLED DIGIT ONE..CIRCLED NUMBER TWENTY |
| 3300..33A6 | So | ㌀..㎦ | SQUARE APAATO..SQUARE KM CUBED |

If an implementation needs to ensure both directions for
compatibility equivalence of identifiers, then the identifier
definition needs to be tailored to add these characters.

For canonical equivalence the implication is true in both directions.
`isIdentifier(toNFC(S))`
if and only if
`isIdentifier(S)`
.

There were two exceptions before Unicode 5.1, as shown in [*Table
9*](#Figure_Canonical_Equivalence_Exceptions_Prior_to_Unicode_5.1). If an implementation needs to ensure full canonical equivalence
of identifiers, then the identifier definition must be tailored so
that these characters have the same value, so that either both
isIdentifier(S) and isIdentifier(toNFC(S)) are true, or so that both
values are false.

Table 9. [Canonical Equivalence Exceptions Prior to Unicode 5.1](#Figure_Canonical_Equivalence_Exceptions_Prior_to_Unicode_5.1)

| isIdentifier(toNFC(S))=True | isIdentifier(S)=False | Different in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 02B9 ( ʹ ) MODIFIER LETTER PRIME | 0374 ( ʹ ) GREEK NUMERAL SIGN | XID and ID |
| 00B7 ( · ) MIDDLE DOT | 0387 ( · ) GREEK ANO TELEIA | XID alone |

Those programming languages with case-insensitive identifiers should
use the case foldings described in *Section 3.13, Default Case
Algorithms*, of [[Unicode](../tr41/tr41-19.html#Unicode)]
to produce a case-insensitive normalized form.

When source text is parsed for identifiers, the folding of
distinctions (using case mapping or NFKC) must be delayed until after
parsing has located the identifiers. Thus such folding of
distinctions should not be applied to string literals or to comments
in program source text.

The Unicode Standard supports case folding with normalization, with
the function toNFKC\_Casefold(X). See definition UAX31-R5 in *Section
3.13, Default Case Algorithms* in [[Unicode](../tr41/tr41-19.html#Unicode)] for the
specification of this function and further explanation of its use.

### 5.2 [Case and Stability](#Case_and_Stability)

The alphabetic case of the initial character of an identifier
is used as a mechanism to distinguish syntactic classes in some
languages like Prolog, Erlang, Haskell, Clean, and Go. For example,
in Prolog and Erlang, variables must begin with capital letters (or
underscores) and atoms must not. There are some complications in the
use of this mechanism.

For such a casing distinction in a programming language to work
with unicameral writing systems (such as Kanji or Devanagari),
another mechanism (such as underscores) needs to substitute for the
casing distinction.

Casing stability is also an issue for bicameral writing systems. The
assignment of General\_Category property values, such as gc=Lu, is not
guaranteed to be stable, nor is the assignment of characters to the
broader properties such as Uppercase. So these property values cannot
be used by themselves, without incorporating a grandfathering
mechanism, such as is done for Unicode identifiers in *Section
2.5 [Backward Compatibility](#Backward_Compatibility)*. That is, the implementation would maintain its own list of special
inclusions and exclusions that require updating for each new version
of Unicode.

Alternatively, a programming language specification can use the
operation specified in [Case
Folding Stability](http://www.unicode.org/policies/stability_policy.html#Case_Folding) as the basis for its casing distinction. That
operation *is* guaranteed to be stable. That is, one can use a
casing distinction such as the following:

1. S is a **variable** if S begins with an
   underscore.
2. Otherwise, produce S' = toCasefold(toNFKC(S))
   1. S is a **variable** if firstCodePoint(S) ≠
      firstCodePoint(S'),
   2. otherwise S is an **atom**.

This test can clearly be optimized ​for the normal cases, such
as initial ASCII. It is also recommended that identifiers be in NFKC
format, which makes the detection even simpler.

#### 5.2.1 [Edge Cases for Folding](#Edge_Cases_for_Folding)

In Unicode 8.0, the Cherokee script letters have been changed
from gc=Lo to gc=Lu, and corresponding lowercase letters (gc=Ll) have
been added. This is an unusual pattern; typically when case pairs are
added, existing letters are changed from gc=Lo to gc=Ll, and new
corresponding uppercase letters (gc=Lu) are added. In the case of
Cherokee, it was felt that this solution provided the most
compatibility for existing implementations in terms of font
treatment.

The downside of this approach is that the Cherokee characters,
when case-folded, will convert as necessary to the pre-8.0
characters, namely to the uppercase versions. This folding is unlike
that of any other case-mapped characters in Unicode. Thus the
case-folded version of a Cherokee string will contain uppercase
letters instead of lowercase letters. Compatibility with fonts for
the current user community was felt to be more important than the
confusion introduced by this edge case of case folding, because
Cherokee programmatic identifiers would be rare.

The upshot is that when it comes to identifiers,
implementations should never use the General\_Category or Lowercase or
Uppercase properties to test for casing conditions, nor use
toUppercase(), toLowercase(), or toTitlecase() to fold or test
identifiers. Instead, they should instead use Case\_Folding or
NFKC\_CaseFold.

## 6 [Hashtag Identifiers](#hashtag_identifiers)

Hashtag identifiers have become very popular in
social media. They consist of a number sign in front of some string
of characters, such as #emoji. The actual composition of allowable
Unicode hashtag identifiers varies between vendors. It has also
become common for hashtags to include emoji characters, without a
clear notion of exactly which characters are included.

This section presents a syntax that can be used
for parsing Unicode hashtag identifiers for increased interoperability.

***[UAX31-D2](#D2)**. **Default
Hashtag Identifier Syntax:***

> `<Hashtag-Identifier> := <Start>
> <Continue>+`

When parsing hashtags in flowing text, it is
recommended that an extended Hashtag only be recognized when there
is no Continue character before a Start character. For example, in
“abc#def” there would be no hashtag, while there would be in “abc
#def” or “abc.#def”.

***[UAX31-R8](#R8)**. **Extended
Hashtag Identifiers:** To meet this requirement, to determine whether
a string is a hashtag identifier an implementation shall use
definition [UAX31-D2](#D2), setting:*

1. *Start := [#＃]*
   * U+0023 NUMBER SIGN
   * U+FF03 FULLWIDTH NUMBER SIGN
2. *Continue := XID\_Continue, plus “\_”, plus
   any character with the property value Emoji=Yes from version 3.0 of [[UTR51](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr41#UTR51)], plus any other characters that can occur in emoji sequences (such as ZWJ), but excluding Start characters. (Thus there are no non-initial # characters)*

* *Alternatively, it shall declare that
  it uses a **profile** as in **[UAX31-R1](#R1)***.

The precise set of emoji characters, and the syntax of emoji
sequences, may change between successive versions of the Unicode
Standard. An implementation can declare a profile that uses a later version of the Emoji property. The grandfathering techniques mentioned in Section 2.5 [Backward Compatibility](#Backward_Compatibility) may be
used where stability between successive versions is required.

Implementations may choose to add characters in *[Table 3a.
Optional Characters for Medial](#Table_Optional_Medial)* and *[Table 3b.
Optional Characters for Continue](#Table_Optional_Continue)* for better identifiers for natural languages. If medial characters are added, the syntax would be changed to:

> `<Hashtag-Identifier> := <Start> <Continue>*
> (<Medial> <Continue>+)*`

## [Migration](#Migration)

**Version 9.0**

In previous versions, the text favored the use
of XID\_Start and XID\_Continue, as in the following paragraph. However, the formal definition used ID\_Start and ID\_Continue.

> The XID\_Start and XID\_Continue properties are improved lexical
> classes that incorporate the changes described in *Section
> 5.1, [NFKC Modifications](#NFKC_Modifications)*. They are recommended for most purposes, especially for security,
> over the original ID\_Start and ID\_Continue properties.

In version 9.0, that is swapped and the X versions are
stated explicitly in the formal definition. This affects just the
following characters.

> `037A ; GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI
>  0E33 ; THAI CHARACTER SARA AM
>
> 0EB3 ; LAO VOWEL SIGN AM
>  309B ; KATAKANA-HIRAGANA VOICED
> SOUND MARK
>  309C ; KATAKANA-HIRAGANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK
>
> FC5E..FC63 ; ARABIC LIGATURE SHADDA WITH SUPERSCRIPT ALEF ISOLATED
> FORM
>  FDFA ; ARABIC LIGATURE SALLALLAHOU ALAYHE WASALLAM
>
> FDFB ; ARABIC LIGATURE JALLAJALALOUHOU
>  FE70 ; ARABIC
> FATHATAN ISOLATED FORM
>  FE72 ; ARABIC DAMMATAN ISOLATED
> FORM
>  FE74 ; ARABIC KASRATAN ISOLATED FORM
>  FE76 ;
> ARABIC FATHA ISOLATED FORM
>  FE78 ; ARABIC DAMMA ISOLATED
> FORM
>  FE7A ; ARABIC KASRA ISOLATED FORM
>  FE7C ;
> ARABIC SHADDA ISOLATED FORM
>  FE7E ; ARABIC SUKUN ISOLATED
> FORM
>  FF9E ; HALFWIDTH KATAKANA VOICED SOUND MARK
>
> FF9F ; HALFWIDTH KATAKANA SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK`

Implementations that wish to maintain
conformance to the older recommendation need only declare a profile
that uses ID\_Start and ID\_Continue instead of XID\_Start and XID\_Continue.

Version 9.0 splits the older Table 3 from Version 8.0 into 3
parts.

| Current Tables | Unicode 8.0 |
| --- | --- |
| *[Table 3. Optional Characters for Start](#Table_Optional_Start)* | Table 3. Candidate Characters for Inclusion in ID\_Continue |
| *[Table 3a. Optional Characters for Medial](#Table_Optional_Medial)* |
| *[Table 3b. Optional Characters for Continue](#Table_Optional_Continue)* | *only outlined in text* |

**Version 6.1**

Between Unicode Versions 5.2, 6.0 and 6.1, Table 5 was split in
three. In Version 6.1, the resulting tables were renumbered for
easier reference. The titles and links remain the same, for
stability.

The following shows the correspondances:

| Current Tables | Unicode 6.0 | Unicode 5.2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *[Table 5, Recommended Scripts](#Table_Recommended_Scripts)* | 5a | 5 |
| *[Table 6, Aspirational Use Scripts](#Aspirational_Use_Scripts)* |
| *[Table 7, Limited Use Scripts](#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts)* | 5b |
| *[Table 8, Compatibility Equivalents to Letters or Decimal Numbers](#Figure_Compatibility_Equivalents_to_Letters_or_Decimal_Numbers)* | 6 | 6 |
| [*Table 9, Canonical Equivalence Exceptions Prior to Unicode 5.1*](#Figure_Canonical_Equivalence_Exceptions_Prior_to_Unicode_5.1) | 7 | 7 |

## [Modifications](#Modifications)

The following summarizes modifications from previous revisions
of this annex.

**Revision 26**

* **Section 2.4 [Specific Character
  Adjustments](#Specific_Character_Adjustments)**
  + Added the Unicode 10 new scripts to
    [Table 4. Candidate Characters for Exclusion from Identifiers](#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers).
  + Withdrew the [Table 6.
    Aspirational Use Scripts](#Aspirational_Use_Scripts), moving the contents to [Table 7.

[Domain spoofing example](attachment.cgi?id=8862557)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8862557&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_12\_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.81 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
The character U+0F8C (TIBETAN SIGN INVERTED MCHU CAN) when used in a domain name in Firefox on Mac looks just like a space.
This can be abused to spoof a legitimate domain followed by a chain of the character, e.g. "accounts.google.com<U+0F8C x 52>.bntk.pl".
I have created a domain <https://important-domain.google.xn--com-lumaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.bntk.pl/> which is SSL-enabled and looks just like important-domain.google.com when your Firefox window is now wide enough to cover the whole address. The DNS limits makes it impossible to add arbitrary number of U+0F8C chars in the address bar. As a workaround, the attacker might add just a dot, hoping that the end-user will not notice it, for example: <http://important-domain.google.xn--com-lumaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.xn--cfdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.bntk.pl/>.
I have attached a screenshot of a SSL-enabled domain using 53 U+0F8C characters.

This could reasonably be moved to Core::Networking because it's IDNA, but we seem to be doing the correct thing. It's a valid "letter" (so adding it to our IDNA blacklist is problematic) and in the examples above there is no script mixing. On Windows there's no spoofing -- this character is included in their fonts.
Chrome has the same problem which is unsurprising because we're trying to follow the same standards. Why did Apple leave this character (and others!) blank? I don't expect them to have supported everything, but unsupported codepoints should have a placeholder.
Any thoughts, Gerv?Flags: needinfo?(gerv)

In the "Location Bar" realm maybe there are things that could address spoofs like this -- and like the completely ascii attempts like <https://paypal.com.services.blahblahblahblahblah>. We do slightly highlight the base domain but it's not very noticeable. Maybe helps if you can see both parts side-by-side, but easy to forget about if the darker part is out of view.
\* we could try a super-obvious highlighting scheme (different background color?) so that people have a better chance of noticing its absence.
\* we could scroll super-long domains so that the base part starts in view even if that means cutting off the front of the URL. This kind of spoof is one reason earlier versions of Firefox (3.x) put the base domain in a blue box for secure origins (we worried less about spoofs of already-insecure sites).
\* keep a platform-dependent list of bogus-blank letters and do something if we see those. Maybe request punycode if we encounter any? In this example Macs would get a punycode label but Windows would see IDN, and Mac would see IDN for other Tibetan IDNs that did not contain any of this handful of blank characters. Seems fair, it's not like even Tibetans will be able to distinguish one blank from another different blank.

\* Use a font we control in the Location Bar? That might have other advantages. Do we ship a font now, for Reader Mode? Could we use it, or is it not comprehensive enough?
This is clearly a bug in the font - if the font doesn't have a glyph for a character, it shouldn't offer to render it, and the end result should be fallback to whatever total fallback font the system has, which normally renders little boxes.
Do we have a handle on the scope of the problem? Is it just this one character, or are there quite a few? Michal: how did you discover this?

I have created a simple script (I'm attaching it) to check what characters might be used in domain names without being transformed to punycode. Then I've had a quick glance through them and noticed that there are four that looks like a space:
f8c <http://testྌ.bntk.pl>
f8d <http://xn--test-tzp.bntk.pl/>
f8e <http://xn--test-yzp.bntk.pl/>
f8f <http://xn--test-3zp.bntk.pl/>
However, it seems that in fact only u+0f8c might be abused in domain name since the other ones are transformed to punycode if there are at least two of them in sequence (for example: <http://test><u+0f8d><u+0f8d>.bntk.pl/ --> <http://xn--test-tzpa.bntk.pl/>.

Are we able to find out which font on the Mac has this problem?
CCing Jonathan Kew. Jonathan: can we fix this in our font code somewhere so we don't pick the dodgy font for this character?
If that's not possible, I agree that blacklisting it (ideally, on the Mac only) is probably the simplest thing.

On my Mac, font fallback is choosing the Simplified Chinese font "Songti SC" for this character. If I disable that font, it falls back to "Songti TC" (the Traditional Chinese version), which has the same issue; and if I disable that as well, it falls back to "STSong", which -also- has a blank glyph here.
Disabling all three of those fonts finally results in a missing-glyph hexbox instead of a blank.
I suppose we could add some code to blacklist this codepoint in those fonts, though it feels like a rather piecemeal approach to the issue.
One thing Chrome does, which we don't currently do, is to show an ellipsis (...) when the URL doesn't fit in the address bar, so there's at least \*some\* visual clue that it is truncated. I suspect users wouldn't usually notice this in the case where the URL appears to be quite short, then there's lots of blank space, and finally "..." at the end, so it's a pretty weak "protection", but nevertheless perhaps worth considering as a small step.
Mostly, though, I think the Location Bar should do something (e.g. scroll the URL such that the base domain is visible, and highlight it?) to help the user notice what the true origin is.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

Huh, this is unfortunate. :-(
What do we do on Windows where this (according to comments so far - I haven't checked!) doesn't work?

Yeah, I don't think this helps "normal" users, even if it would make power users feel better (maybe) about this type of attack, so I'm not convinced it's worth implementing, also because it's not trivial to do, so the cost/gain ratio is pretty bad.

I'm not aware of a good way to know how far to 'scroll' a textbox to show a given substring of its value. A lot of the ways of scrolling the textbox also involve modifying the selection (which breaks some user workflows) and/or hiding the selection/cursor (ie if not modifying it, but scrolling the textbox), neither of which is really very nice.
Finally, it's not clear what happens when the base domain is longer than what we can display (ie if the domain is long and/or the url bar is narrow). Cropping anything will just leave us open to spoofing based on the remaining part.
Ironically, we currently go to some lengths to scroll the textbox to the \*beginning\* in various circumstances, to avoid spoofs that do the opposite and append fake information after the main domain...
Given all of that, I don't see a lot of good options beyond the nuclear Safari one - when the URL bar is not focused, display \*only\* the base domain.

Do we have a conduit into Apple for reporting font bugs?
Regardless, this isn't going to get fixed any time soon. I suspect what solution we go for depends on what engineering resources we have available to us, but if we have to do the minimum effort solution, I'd be happy with a Mac-specific pref (can you append to prefs using our macro system?) to blacklist this single character.

We don't "do" anything; Windows (presumably) just doesn't ship with a font that has a blank glyph at this (non-blank) character position. So users see either the proper (visible) glyph, or if no font supporting the character is present, a hexbox.

Indeed. And even if/when it does get fixed, that won't help users on existing OS versions that (past experience says) won't get updated fonts; it will only benefit future versions.

Work around some broken Apple fonts
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The patch identifies specific characters that may display incorrectly; from there to using those characters in a spoofed domain name is a pretty trivial step.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Pretty much: we're blacklisting specific characters in specific fonts, which is hard to disguise. The only slightly obscure thing is the idea that it might be possible to use these as part of a domain name.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
It's not our bug, it's a fault in Apple's fonts.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Patch should transplant easily to all branches.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Minimal risk.

We've called this kind of spoof "sec-high" at times, "sec-moderate" other times. This is at the low end of sec-high I guess since it's only one platform and not really our bug, but it's not wrong to say this could be a convincing spoof.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEW

Yes, it's been reported to Chromium. However they haven't decided to take any action on it yet, besides reporting the font bug to Apple.
They consider the blacklisting though (and I additionally urged them to do so) so I guess they'll go this way soon.
Not sure how your coordination with Chromium works, but if you need to specify a concrete bug in communication with them, here it is: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=714196> (it's a private bug).

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Thunderbird.
Support for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update
we're now following the 52.x releases.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:52.2.1-4~deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:52.2.1-4~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

#### [#CVE-2017-7760: File manipulation and privilege escalation via callback parameter in Mozilla Windows Updater and Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7760)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

#### [#CVE-2017-7765: Mark of the Web bypass when saving executable files](#CVE-2017-7765)

Reporter
Jonathan Birch and Microsoft Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1273265](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1273265)

#### [#CVE-2017-7766: File execution and privilege escalation through updater.ini, Mozilla Windows Updater, and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7766)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

An attack using manipulation of `updater.ini` contents, used by the Mozilla Windows Updater, and privilege escalation through the Mozilla Maintenance Service to allow for arbitrary file execution and deletion by the Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1342742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742)

#### [#CVE-2017-7767: Privilege escalation and arbitrary file overwrites through Mozilla Windows Updater and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7767)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to overwrite arbitrary files with junk data using the Mozilla Windows Updater, which runs with the Maintenance Service's privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1336964](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1336964)

#### [#CVE-2017-7768: 32 byte arbitrary file read through Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7768)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-5470: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 54 and Firefox ESR 52.2](#CVE-2017-5470)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer overflows
and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code, denial of service or domain spoofing.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 52.x releases.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1461262#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2017-06-14 04:39:34 UTC  ``` Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
