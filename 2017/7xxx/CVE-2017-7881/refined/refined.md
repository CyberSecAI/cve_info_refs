Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-7881:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flawed Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism in BigTree CMS. The CSRF check was implemented using a simple substring check on the `HTTP_REFERER` header, rather than a more robust method, such as a full match or a token-based approach.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure CSRF Protection:** The core weakness is the use of `strpos()` to validate the `HTTP_REFERER` header in `/core/admin/modules/developer/_header.php`. This check only verifies if the required string `admin/developer/` is present anywhere in the referrer, and it does not require it to be at the beginning.
*   **PHPMailer RCE:** The vulnerable version of PHPMailer (prior to 5.2.20) was used within BigTree CMS, and the `Sender` field was being populated using unsanitized user input, making it possible to inject arbitrary parameters.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `sendEmail` function uses the `$from` variable directly to set `$mailer->Sender` without proper sanitization. The value of `$from` comes from the settings, specifically `$_POST["bigtree_from"]`, which is set by user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. By exploiting the PHPMailer vulnerability through a CSRF attack, the attacker could inject malicious code into the `Sender` field, leading to the execution of that code when an email is sent.
*   **System Compromise:** The RCE could be leveraged by attackers to take complete control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** The primary attack vector involves exploiting the weak CSRF protection. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when loaded by an authenticated administrator, sends a POST request with attacker controlled parameters.
*   **HTTP Referer Manipulation:** The vulnerable code checks if the `HTTP_REFERER` header contains `admin/developer/` as a substring. Attackers can bypass this by injecting this string into the query parameters of an attacker controlled URL that is then loaded by the user.
*   **PHPMailer Exploitation:** Once the CSRF protection is bypassed, the attacker manipulates the `bigtree_from` POST parameter, which is then used to set the PHPMailer `Sender` property, ultimately leading to RCE when the `sendEmail` function is used, such as through the "forgot password" functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote, as the attack is network-based.
*   **User Interaction (CSRF):** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator to load a malicious HTML page, triggering the CSRF attack.
*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the server before starting the attack.

**More Details than CVE Description:**

The provided content offers more detailed insights than the basic CVE description, including:

*   Specific code locations of the vulnerable code in BigTree CMS.
*   Detailed explanation of the flawed CSRF protection logic.
*   Step-by-step breakdown of the attack and how the RCE is achieved using a crafted `Sender` field.
*   Details on how the `bigtree_from` setting is modified through a CSRF attack to facilitate the PHPMailer exploitation.
*   The fix that was implemented was to change the `strpos` check to require the vulnerable part of the URI to be at the start of the string (`strpos($clean_referer, $clean_domain) !== 0`)
