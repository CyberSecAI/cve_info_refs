When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

This problem are not redirects. The redirects are handle correctly, i.e. we do not show uri of redirects only the originalURI.
The resource at the address indicated by iframe changes the location and reloads the iframe, itself.
We can detect that as: a "load\_replace"(I need to check the correct name of the flag) of a page that is triggered by the iframe context.

Interesting.
So, with server side redirect:
<https://test.shhnjk.com/iframer.php?url=//vuln.shhnjk.com/location.php?url=//shhnjk.com>
Console: performance.getEntriesByType("resource")
Redirected URL is not leaked.
But if framed content had meta refresh or script like location.replace:
<https://test.shhnjk.com/iframer.php?url=//vuln.shhnjk.com/meta.php?url=//shhnjk.com>
Console: performance.getEntriesByType("resource")
Redirected URL is leaked.
I still feel that this is a leak since some website uses script to redirect the page (Bing as an example).

I could detect that referrerUri is different(checking only for cross-origin is not enough, we will not leak anything but it is in my opinion not correct) from the owning doc uri and that the load type is nsIDocShellLoadInfo::loadStopContentAndReplace. This should be sufficient, but I need to think if it is going to catch cases that we do not want to block... probably it is ok to block all such cases.... all in all I think from HttpChannelChild I cannot properly detect that is iframe reloading itself
Anyway I think it is better to detect this in dom(probably in dome/base/Location.cpp) instead of necko.
bz, I am not sure how to do this in dom properly. I will need some help, or maybe someone from dome team could take it this bug.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

The first question is: What does the spec say to do?
Does it have to be a "redirect", even? What happens if user clicks a link in the iframe? If I do a simple test:
1) Load data:text/html,<iframe src="<http://example.com>">
2) Click the "More information" link in the iframe (probably need to scroll down to see it).
3) Examine performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1].name in the console
I get "<http://www.iana.org/domains/example>".
Using a testcase not affected by X-frame-options, like so:
1) Load data:text/html,<iframe%20src="<http://web.mit.edu>"></iframe>
2) Scroll down to the "admissions" option in the menu and click it.
3) Click "undergrad".
4) Examine performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1].name
then I see "<http://www.mitadmissions.org/>" in Firefox and Safari. So we're leaking that information cross-site. This seems like a fundamental bug in the resource timing spec that needs to be fixed in the spec, assuming we have per-spec behavior here. If we don't have per-spec behavior, we should fix it to be per-spec and add tests as needed.
For what it's worth, using my mit.edu testcase in Chrome and Edge performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1] is undefined and performance.getEntriesByType("resource").length == 1.
> Anyway I think it is better to detect this in dom(probably in dome/base/Location.cpp)
That wouldn't address the link click case.

From what I can tell, there isn't anything in the spec specifically about this case. That left room to implementation issues such as this.
We do correctly report the first load of the iframe. However, a reload of the iframe triggered by JS or the meta tag or even user activity will cause the navigations to be shown in the parent document's performance.
Boris, do we have a way of identifying these types of loads triggered from the iframe, as opposed to loads triggered from the parent document?Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu) → needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Identifying them at what point?
It seems like for iframes, we only want to add things to resource timing if the load is triggered by modification of the iframe's "src" attribute, right? We certainly know at the point where that happens that this is what's triggering the load, but it sounds like the information is needed somewhere else?
Again, ideally we would just implement the spec's processing model and this would fall out naturally...Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

It does, but the case of iframe navigation isn't explicitly specified.
<https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#resources-included>
"Sub-resources requested by the IFRAME document will be included in the IFRAME document's Performance Timeline and not the parent document's Performance Timeline. "

It would be great if we already had a flag set on the channel, so that we'd only need to change HttpBaseChannel::GetPerformance().

Correct.

I can see us performing this check either in HttpBaseChannel::GetPerformance() or PerformanceMainThread::AddEntry()

I agree, but the spec doesn't seem to specify much regarding iframe interaction apart from the snippet I quoted above.

I'm not sure I follow. If there's an actual step-by-step processing model, then it explicitly defines what things are or are not inserted in the resource timing list; you just step through it.
> It would be great if we already had a flag set on the channel, so that we'd only need to change HttpBaseChannel::GetPerformance().
Hmm. So the issue is that the loadingDocument is the parent doc for all navigations in an iframe, right? Should it really be, if the navigations are triggered by the subframe itself?
Assuming it is, we can either add a channel flag, or add a new loadinfo member for which document is "really" responsible for the load. In either case, we'd need to thread that information down to where docshell creates the channel, starting from ... well, it depends on how fake-plugin <object> should behave. But probably from nsFrameLoader::ReallyStartLoadingInternal though if we want to we could restrict that to cases in which mURIToLoad comes from nsFrameLoader::LoadFrame.
> I agree, but the spec doesn't seem to specify much regarding iframe interaction apart from the snippet I quoted above.
Then the spec is broken and we need a spec issue filed.

The loadingDocument will correctly point to the iframe document for all resources loaded by the iframe, but when a navigation happens in the iframe, the loadingDocument is still that of the parent.

Agreed. I'll file an issue as soon as we ship a fix.

Hmm. It does band-aid the immediate problem, so might be worth taking, with some code comments, including on branches, and filing a followup to do the general "don't add navigations not caused by src changes" thing. Assuming that's what Edge and Chrome do; we would need to add tests for that...
Furthermore, something like this might be needed anyway, to address other information leaks. For example, consider a document at origin X that loads a stylesheet at origin Y. Should background image, font, etc loads from that stylesheet show up in the resource timing of the document? Looks to me like this change would filter them out. Again, need to test what other browsers do in that situation, and check what the spec says, possibly raising spec issues in the process.

Please don't forget sec-approval and the followup bugs to:
1) Add tests.
2) Fix the stylesheet issue I mentioned, assuming it's an issue.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not difficult.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Yes, the problem is quite obvious.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Since initial landing of resource timing.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Applies without conflicts on release and esr52.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very small risk of regressions. Resource timing has a fair number of tests.

Although the default BMO UI makes it less visible, the Whiteboard is still the best place to raise this. As part of writing advisories or unhiding bugs we check and update the whiteboard--it won't be missed. Even a simple "Embargo" or "Keep hidden" will force us to look for details in the comment that added that whiteboard notation.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Open the browser console and enter this code:
var proxy = new Proxy({}, new Proxy({}, {get: (\_, trap) => (\_, ...args) => {
throw new Error(`proxy trap ${JSON.stringify(trap)} was called with arguments ${args.map(JSON.stringify).join(", ")}.`);
}}));
var sandbox = Cu.Sandbox(null);
sandbox.inheritsProxy = Object.create(proxy);
sandbox.eval(`Reflect.apply(inheritsProxy, null, [])`);
// Error: proxy trap "has" was called with arguments "\_\_exposedProps\_\_".
sandbox.eval(`Reflect.defineProperty(inheritsProxy, "a", {})`);
// Error: proxy trap "has" was called with arguments "\_\_exposedProps\_\_".
sandbox.eval(`Reflect.deleteProperty(inheritsProxy, "a", {})`);
// Error: proxy trap "has" was called with arguments "\_\_exposedProps\_\_".
sandbox.eval(`Reflect.get(inheritsProxy, "a")`);
// Error: proxy trap "has" was called with arguments "\_\_exposedProps\_\_".
sandbox.eval(`Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(inheritsProxy, "a")`);
// Error: proxy trap "has" was called with arguments "\_\_exposedProps\_\_".
sandbox.eval(`Reflect.has(inheritsProxy, "a")`);
// Error: proxy trap "has" was called with arguments "\_\_exposedProps\_\_".
sandbox.eval(`Reflect.ownKeys(inheritsProxy)`);
// Error: proxy trap "has" was called with arguments "\_\_exposedProps\_\_".
sandbox.eval(`Reflect.set(inheritsProxy, "a", 1)`);
// Error: proxy trap "has" was called with arguments "\_\_exposedProps\_\_".
This should not happen. It does not happen if I use one of these:
sandbox.inheritsProxy = Object.setPrototypeOf(function(){}, proxy);
sandbox.inheritsProxy = Object.setPrototypeOf([], proxy);
sandbox.inheritsProxy = proxy;
Then I only get "Permission denied" errors. So how come the proxy trap runs with Object.create(proxy) ?
The security wrapper is calling traps instead of protecting the proxy!!
This seems like a flaw of the security wrapper, so I'm marking this as security sensitive.

It seems this can make an assert fail. Initially I reported it as [bug 1391869](/show_bug.cgi?id=1391869 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Failed assert in CallJSNative"), but I guess the assert is fine and it's just that the security wrappers are not behaving properly.
1. Run a debugging build
2. Disable activity stream, so that new tabs are privileged
3. Open a new tab
4. Open the web console and enter this code:
var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.src = "about:blank";
document.documentElement.appendChild(iframe);
var inheritsProxy = Object.create(new Proxy({}, {
has: (\_, prop) => {
throw new Error('proxy trap "has" was called with argument ' + JSON.stringify(prop));
}
}));
iframe.onload = function() {
gDebuggee = iframe.contentWindow;
Cu.exportFunction(eval, gDebuggee, {defineAs: "globalEval"})
gDebuggee.eval("(function stopMe(arg) {debugger;})(globalEval('inheritsProxy'));");
};

The problem is here:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/7dddbd85047c6dc73ddbe1e423cd643a217845b3/js/xpconnect/wrappers/AccessCheck.cpp#359>

I think the prototype chain should be iterated manually, using JS\_GetOwnPropertyDescriptorById on each object \*\*if the policy allows it\*\*. Alternatively, don't iterate the prototype chain of the unwrapped object at all, but this could break things. Anyways, never access proxy objects, they have an opaque policy!Component: JavaScript Engine → XPConnectSummary: Security wrapper calls proxy trap "has" for property "\_\_exposedProps\_\_" → ExposedPropertiesOnly::check calls proxy traps "has" and "getOwnPropertyDescriptor" for property "\_\_exposedProps\_\_"

We should be able to just remove \_\_exposedProps\_\_ at this point, see [bug 1377587](/show_bug.cgi?id=1377587 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove __exposedProps__").
A more-targeted fix is likely possible. I don't have cycles to dig in though, so will need another xpconnect peer to pick this up.

I don't see any reason why we should let \_\_exposedProps\_\_ work on proxy objects or objects with a proxy in their proto chain especially since we're moving away from \_\_exposedProps\_\_.

Thanks, this is an awesome bug report! Do you know about any use case where we want \_\_exposedProps to work on proxy objects (or objects with proxy in their proto chain)?Flags: needinfo?(gkrizsanits)

Per [bug 1377587](/show_bug.cgi?id=1377587 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove __exposedProps__"), I don't think we care about \_\_exposedProps\_\_ working at all, period. I'm not sure why that bug stalled, but we could also just finish that instead.

Nope. But I think that if an object has a policy that allows \_\_exposedProps\_\_, then there is no need to break that in case there is a proxy in the prototype. It's just that the \_\_exposedProps\_\_ lookup should stop iterating the prototype chain when an object with an opaque policy is found.
But as Bobby Holley says, if \_\_exposedProps\_\_ is going to be removed soon, then I guess it doesn't matter.

Thanks for working on this. What are the security implications of this problem? Would this require somebody write some odd code in an extension, or does this affect baseline Firefox? What is the worst that could happen from it? That will determine the security rating, which will determine whether we should fix this on older branches, or just remove \_\_exposedProps\_\_ on trunk and leave it alone otherwise.Flags: needinfo?(gkrizsanits)

So the whole thing came up from a debugger test as far as I can tell (see [bug 1391869](/show_bug.cgi?id=1391869 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Failed assert in CallJSNative")), and the annoying part is that you don't even have to define any \_\_exposedProps\_\_ on a privileged object to be able to trigger the proxy trap on it. I would pretty much ignore the problem, since normally some really weird add-on is needed to expose a privileged object to content with a proxy hooked into its proto chain.
But it seems like with the debugger we might run into this problem and during debugging hitting proxy traps unexpectedly can cause a whole lot of trouble. So from security standpoint this seems like a moderate, the actual importance/urgency to fix this bug is depending on how can the debugger ever run into a case where this problem happens.
Oriol, could you explain us what are the implications of this bug from the debugger perspective?Flags: needinfo?(gkrizsanits) → needinfo?(oriol-bugzilla)

It means that if the debugger gets an object with ExposedPropertiesOnly policy, then just doing trivial things like getting its class will autoenter the policy. This will iterate the prototype with an \_\_exposedProps\_\_ lookup, possibly running proxy traps.
Moreover, this operation is expected to not throw, but a proxy trap can throw and thus fail some asserts as explained in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - ExposedPropertiesOnly::check calls proxy traps \"has\" and \"getOwnPropertyDescriptor\" for property \"__exposedProps__\""). Not nice if you are using a debug build and it crashes.
The debugger should never run scripted proxy traps. I'm attempting to cover all cases, so I noticed this one. But I guess that debugging an object with ExposedPropertiesOnly policy is not much common. Mostly it's when you are debugging a global A which has a reference to an object from a system principal global B, but A does not subsume B. This can be done using the console or add-ons.Flags: needinfo?(oriol-bugzilla)

Thanks for the thorough tests :) and for the explanation.
So all in all, from a security perspective I'm not too worried probably it's OK to just wait for the removal of \_\_exposedProps\_\_. Based on [Comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026#c16 "RESOLVED FIXED - ExposedPropertiesOnly::check calls proxy traps \"has\" and \"getOwnPropertyDescriptor\" for property \"__exposedProps__\"") it does not seem super important for the debugger either, but it might cause some annoyances for a couple of people in some very edge cases. I'm OK with just won't fix this if \_\_exposedProps\_\_ will make it to 57, alternatively we can land/uplift some hack like my patch to quickfix it, if we want to stay on the safe side.

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.

Reporter

Impact

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
