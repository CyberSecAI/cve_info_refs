    "summary": "The provided content details a vulnerability in Firefox related to JavaScript proxy objects and their interaction with the `__exposedProps__` mechanism, which is identified as CVE-2017-7831. The vulnerability arises from the security wrapper not properly denying access to exposed properties on proxy objects, potentially leading to information disclosure and unexpected proxy trap executions during debugger operations.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The security wrapper in Firefox does not correctly handle access to exposed properties (`__exposedProps__`) on JavaScript proxy objects. Specifically, it calls proxy traps (`has` and `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`) when checking for exposed properties, instead of denying access to the properties.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "The security wrapper incorrectly invokes proxy traps when checking for exposed properties, which should be explicitly unavailable on proxy objects.",
        "The vulnerability can lead to unexpected behavior when debugging objects with ExposedPropertiesOnly policy due to the iteration of prototype chains and potential exceptions from proxy traps.",
         "Information disclosure through access to properties that should not be accessible via proxy objects."
      ],
      "impact": "The primary impact is an information disclosure vulnerability. The flawed implementation can expose properties that should not be accessible via proxy objects. Additionally, this issue can lead to failed assertions or unexpected behavior when using the debugger.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting or using JavaScript proxy objects with custom traps. This can be used in a debugging context or through a malicious addon to trigger the vulnerabilities.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create and manipulate JavaScript proxy objects, which can be done through custom scripts. In addition, while not a direct attack vector, this vulnerability also has negative implications in debugging scenarios. The attacker also needs to have a  target with the vulnerable Firefox browser.",
       "additional_notes": "The provided bug report and advisory indicates that the fix is included in Firefox 57.  Also, the vulnerability is related to the usage of a deprecated mechanism.  There are also specific cases mentioned, such as use of `Object.create(proxy)` where the vulnerability can be exploited, whereas other techniques using `Object.setPrototypeOf()` does not expose the vulnerability. The severity was assessed as \"moderate\" by Mozilla."
