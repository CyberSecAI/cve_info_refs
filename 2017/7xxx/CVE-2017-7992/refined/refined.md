The provided content details a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `heartland-php` SDK.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because the application directly outputs user-supplied data from the HTTP GET parameter without proper sanitization or encoding. Specifically, the `cruise.php` file in the `examples/consumer-authentication` directory is vulnerable at line 27, where the `$_GET` parameter is directly used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability. User-controlled input is included in the server response without adequate encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter. When a user clicks on a crafted URL, the injected JavaScript code is executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing cookies
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the webpage

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload in the vulnerable `cavv` parameter. The attacker then sends this malicious link to a victim through social engineering or other methods.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to construct a malicious URL and trick the user into clicking on it. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the target application.
