Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7700:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the NetScaler file parser within Wireshark's libwiretap library.
*   A malformed or fuzzed NetScaler trace file can trigger an infinite loop in the `nstrace_set_start_time_v20` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Improper handling of malformed data within the NetScaler file parser.
*   Lack of proper input validation or error handling that allows an infinite loop to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS) by causing Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources.
*   The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious NetScaler packet trace file.
*   The victim must open the crafted file using a vulnerable version of Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed NetScaler trace file.
*   The attacker needs to deliver this malicious file to the victim, often through social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was discovered by Otto Airamo and Antti Levom√§ki from Forcepoint.
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11.
*   The fix was included in Wireshark versions 2.2.6 and 2.0.12.
