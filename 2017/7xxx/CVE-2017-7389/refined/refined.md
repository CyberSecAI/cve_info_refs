- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in multiple parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious URLs with JavaScript code injected into the `meeting_id` and `user` parameters of the `webconf.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and have a victim click on them or have the link presented in an XSS vulnerable context.
