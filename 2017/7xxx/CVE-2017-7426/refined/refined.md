Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7426:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2017-7426" and relates it to an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Micro Focus Identity Manager iManager plugins. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the presence of XXE vulnerabilities in the Identity Manager iManager plugins. This means that the application processes XML input without proper sanitization, leading to the possibility of exploiting external entities.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the improper handling of external entities in XML parsing. This can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server hosting the iManager application. This could include configuration files, user data, or other confidential information.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through the Identity Manager Plug-in hosted on iManager. This suggests that a malicious XML payload needs to be submitted to the vulnerable component to trigger the XXE vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted XML requests to the vulnerable iManager plugin interface, which implies network access to the application.
   - The content does not specify the authentication requirements but implies that the attacker needs to interact with the plugin over the network.

**Summary:**
The provided information indicates that CVE-2017-7426 is an XXE vulnerability affecting Micro Focus iManager plugins. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted XML requests to read arbitrary files from the server. The vulnerability was fixed in IDM 4.6.1 Identity Manager Plug-ins, dated July 10, 2017 or newer.
