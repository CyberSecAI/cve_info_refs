```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Humax Digital HG100R router allows unauthenticated download of a backup file containing sensitive information.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The router does not require authentication to download the backup file `GatewaySettings.bin`. This file stores the router's credentials in plaintext.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can download the backup file, extract the plaintext credentials, and gain unauthorized access to the router's web interface and potentially the network.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited over the network by sending an HTTP GET request to download the backup file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have network access to it. They do not need any prior authentication to retrieve the backup file.
