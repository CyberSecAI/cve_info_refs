Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `tpm_kdfa()` function in `tpm2-tools`. This function, when used for HMAC authorization, previously calculated the HMAC using the TPM. This process involved sending the user's password to the TPM in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Password Transmission:** The primary weakness is that the user's password, intended to be kept secret, was transmitted in plaintext to the TPM during the HMAC calculation. This exposes the password to potential interception.
- **Insecure HMAC calculation:** The HMAC calculation was being performed by the TPM instead of on the host.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Password Leak:** An attacker could potentially intercept the plaintext password during its transmission to the TPM.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The exposure of the password leads to a breach of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker could potentially intercept network traffic between the client and the TPM to capture the plaintext password.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** A malicious actor could position themselves between the client and the TPM, intercepting the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to intercept the communication channel between the client and the TPM.
- **Passive or Active Interception:**  The attacker can either passively monitor the network traffic or actively intercept and modify it.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves using OpenSSL to generate the HMAC on the host, ensuring that the password is never transmitted to the TPM.
- The vulnerable code was present in `tpm_kdfa.c` and used in `tpm_session.c`. The fix involves changes in `Makefile.am`, `configure.ac`, `lib/tpm_kdfa.c`, `lib/tpm_kdfa.h` and `lib/tpm_session.c`.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
- CVSS v3 base metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `tpm2-tools` before 1.1.1.
