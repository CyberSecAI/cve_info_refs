Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Firefox for Android's handling of fullscreen mode transitions. Specifically, a page can switch to fullscreen mode without user notification, allowing a malicious page to display a fake address bar.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The primary weakness is the ability to spoof the address bar in fullscreen mode. Since the transition to fullscreen happens silently, a malicious website can display its own fake address bar, potentially tricking the user into believing they are on a legitimate site.
*   **Lack of User Notification:** The absence of user notification when entering fullscreen mode is a key vulnerability that allows the spoofing to occur without raising suspicion. The user is not explicitly made aware that they are no longer within the normal browser UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to create convincing phishing pages that mimic legitimate websites. The user may unknowingly enter sensitive information like passwords or credit card details into these fake forms, believing they are interacting with a legitimate site.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The vulnerability can also be used to trick users into downloading and installing malware. By spoofing the address bar and content, an attacker could make it seem as if a user is downloading something from a trusted source when it is actually malicious software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted web pages that can initiate a silent transition to fullscreen mode. This could be achieved through Javascript or other web technologies.
*   **User Interaction:** The user typically must interact with a link or other element on the malicious web page to trigger the silent transition to fullscreen. However, the user doesn't have to explicitly accept the fullscreen request. Scrolling down the page with a specific link can also trigger it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Web Pages:** The attacker needs the ability to host or inject malicious web content onto a web server.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker might need to use social engineering tactics to get users to visit the malicious web page. For example, embedding the link in a phishing email or an instant message.
*   **Android Firefox User:** The user must be using Firefox on Android to be vulnerable to this exploit. The vulnerability is specific to the Android version of Firefox; desktop versions are not affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a "snackbar" notification that appears when the user enters full screen mode to warn them of the change and how to exit.
* The original report included the ability to spoof the address bar via a `data:` URL when a user scrolled down the page and then clicked a link to go to fullscreen.
*   The reported severity for this vulnerability is 'high'.
