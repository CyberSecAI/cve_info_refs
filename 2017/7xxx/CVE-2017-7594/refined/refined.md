Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7594:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a direct memory leak in the `tif_ojpeg.c` file within the LibTIFF library, specifically in the `OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesDcTable` and other related functions. The code allocates memory using `_TIFFmalloc`, but if a specific condition (e.g., `if (p!=q)`) occurs during the parsing of the file, the allocated memory is never assigned to its intended destination (`sp->dctable[m]=rb;`) and is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Memory leak: Unreferenced memory is allocated and lost, eventually leading to denial of service by consuming all available RAM or causing the application to crash due to out of memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of service: The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, causing the application using the libtiff library to crash.
- Possible arbitrary code execution: Although not directly specified for this CVE, other related CVEs and the general nature of memory corruption bugs leave open the possibility that crafted inputs can be made to leverage such bugs to obtain arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

- Malicious TIFF file: An attacker can craft a special TIFF image file that exploits the memory leak vulnerability.
- User interaction: A user or an automated system needs to be tricked into opening or processing this malicious TIFF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted TIFF file to the victim. This could be through a website, email, or any other file transfer method.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability if a program is using a vulnerable libtiff version.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding a free command before returning 0 in the affected code block.
*   The fix was applied to the `tif_ojpeg.c` file.
*  Multiple, similar leaks in the same file were fixed, following the report of the first leak.
* Several distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo, have released updates to address this and other related libtiff vulnerabilities.
