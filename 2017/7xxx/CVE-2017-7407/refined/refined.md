  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `ourWriteOut` function of the `curl` command-line tool when processing the `--write-out` option with a format string ending in a '%' character.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from process memory by crafting a specific format string used with the `--write-out` option.",

      "The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious or wrongly formatted URL used with the `--write-out` option, where the format string ends in a '%' character."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to control the input provided to the `curl` command-line tool, particularly the `--write-out` format string, and have physical proximity to observe the output."
