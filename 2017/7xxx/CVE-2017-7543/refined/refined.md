  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-7543",
    "description": "A race-condition flaw was discovered in openstack-neutron where, following a minor overcloud update, neutron security groups were disabled. Specifically, the following were reset to 0: net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables and net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables. The race was only triggered by an update, at which point an attacker could access exposed tenant VMs and network resources.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition in openstack-neutron during an overcloud update.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Improper security group handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Disabling of neutron security groups, leading to unauthorized access to tenant VMs and network resources.",
    "attack_vector": "Triggering an overcloud update.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger an OpenStack overcloud update. No authentication is required beyond that."
