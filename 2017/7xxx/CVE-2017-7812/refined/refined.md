Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles drag-and-drop events when content is dragged from a web page to outside the content area, specifically the browser UI like the tab bar.
- Web content can modify the `dataTransfer` object during the `dragstart` event. This object stores the data being dragged.
- When a drag-and-drop operation is initiated from a web page and the drop target is outside the content area (e.g., tab bar), the browser incorrectly uses the modified data from `dataTransfer` which can include a link to a local file (`file:` URL).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Privilege Checks:**  The browser does not properly validate the origin or the permissions when a drag-and-drop operation occurs outside of the content area. Specifically, it doesn't check the principal of the source node correctly when the dragged content originates from a web page.
- **Data Modification:** Web content has the ability to modify the `dataTransfer` object's data during a `dragstart` event, leading to a scenario where a malicious web page can inject a `file:` URL into the drag-and-drop operation.
- **Bypassing Security Restrictions:** The ability to open `file:` URLs through drag and drop bypasses standard security measures that prevent web content from directly accessing local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Access:** A successful exploit allows malicious web content to open locally stored files on the victim's machine using `file:` URLs. This could lead to information disclosure or other malicious actions, depending on the nature of the opened file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Drag-and-Drop Operation:** An attacker would craft a web page that manipulates the `dataTransfer` object during a drag-and-drop event.
- **Targeted UI Elements:** The user must drag the content from the malicious webpage to a specific part of the browser UI (like the tab bar).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page that can be accessed by the victim.
- The attacker needs the victim to perform a drag-and-drop operation from the malicious page to a specific UI element within the browser.
