#### [#CVE-2017-7817: Firefox for Android address bar spoofing through fullscreen mode](#CVE-2017-7817)

Reporter
Raphael Saniyazov
Impact
high
##### Description

A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a page switches to fullscreen mode without user notification, allowing a fake address bar to be displayed. This allows an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use.
*Note: This attack only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1356596](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1356596)

#### [#CVE-2017-7818: Use-after-free during ARIA array manipulation](#CVE-2017-7818)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating arrays of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) elements within containers through the DOM. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1363723](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1363723)

#### [#CVE-2017-7819: Use-after-free while resizing images in design mode](#CVE-2017-7819)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in design mode when image objects are resized if objects referenced during the resizing have been freed from memory. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1380292](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380292)

#### [#CVE-2017-7824: Buffer overflow when drawing and validating elements with ANGLE](#CVE-2017-7824)

Reporter
Omair, Andre Weissflog
Impact
high
##### Description

A buffer overflow occurs when drawing and validating elements with the ANGLE graphics library, used for WebGL content. This is due to an incorrect value being passed within the library during checks and results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1398381](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1398381)

#### [#CVE-2017-7805: Use-after-free in TLS 1.2 generating handshake hashes](#CVE-2017-7805)

Reporter
Martin Thomson
Impact
high
##### Description

During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1377618](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377618)

#### [#CVE-2017-7812: Drag and drop of malicious page content to the tab bar can open locally stored files](#CVE-2017-7812)

Reporter
Tooru Fujisawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If web content on a page is dragged onto portions of the browser UI, such as the tab bar, links can be opened that otherwise would not be allowed to open. This can allow malicious web content to open a locally stored file through `file:` URLs.

##### References

* [Bug 1379842](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379842)

#### [#CVE-2017-7814: Blob and data URLs bypass phishing and malware protection warnings](#CVE-2017-7814)

Reporter
François Marier
Impact
moderate
##### Description

File downloads encoded with `blob:` and `data:` URL elements bypassed normal file download checks though the Phishing and Malware Protection feature and its block lists of suspicious sites and files. This would allow malicious sites to lure users into downloading executables that would otherwise be detected as suspicious.

##### References

* [Bug 1376036](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376036)

#### [#CVE-2017-7813: Integer truncation in the JavaScript parser](#CVE-2017-7813)

Reporter
Abhishek Arya
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Inside the JavaScript parser, a cast of an integer to a narrower type can result in data read from outside the buffer being parsed. This usually results in a non-exploitable crash, but can leak a limited amount of information from memory if it matches JavaScript identifier syntax.

##### References

* [Bug 1383951](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1383951)

#### [#CVE-2017-7825: OS X fonts render some Tibetan and Arabic unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7825)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Several fonts on OS X display some Tibetan and Arabic characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1393624](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393624)
* [Bug 1390980](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1390980)

#### [#CVE-2017-7815: Spoofing attack with modal dialogs on non-e10s installations](#CVE-2017-7815)

Reporter
Jose María Acuña
Impact
moderate
##### Description

On pages containing an iframe, the `data:` protocol can be used to create a modal dialog through Javascript that will have an arbitrary domains as the dialog's location, spoofing of the origin of the modal dialog from the user view.
*Note: This attack only affects installations with e10 multiprocess turned off. Installations with e10s turned on do not support the modal dialog functionality.*

##### References

* [Bug 1368981](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1368981)

#### [#CVE-2017-7816: WebExtensions can load about: URLs in extension UI](#CVE-2017-7816)

Reporter

##### References

* [Bug 1380597](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380597)

#### [#CVE-2017-7821: WebExtensions can download and open non-executable files without user interaction](#CVE-2017-7821)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where WebExtensions can download and attempt to open a file of some non-executable file types. This can be triggered without specific user interaction for the file download and open actions. This could be used to trigger known vulnerabilities in the programs that handle those document types.

##### References

* [Bug 1346515](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1346515)

#### [#CVE-2017-7823: CSP sandbox directive did not create a unique origin](#CVE-2017-7823)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The content security policy (CSP) `sandbox` directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the `allow-same-origin` keyword were always specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content.

##### References

* [Bug 1396320](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396320)

#### [#CVE-2017-7822: WebCrypto allows AES-GCM with 0-length IV](#CVE-2017-7822)

Reporter
Thanh Bui
Impact
low
##### Description

The AES-GCM implementation in WebCrypto API accepts 0-length IV when it should require a length of 1 according to the NIST Special Publication 800-38D specification. This might allow for the authentication key to be determined in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1368859](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1368859)

#### [#CVE-2017-7820: Xray wrapper bypass with new tab and web console](#CVE-2017-7820)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
low
##### Description

The `instanceof` operator can bypass the Xray wrapper mechanism. When called on web content from the browser itself or an extension the web content can provide its own result for that operator, possibly tricking the browser or extension into mishandling the element.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

maybe better describing the details here too.
web content can modify the dataTransfer in dragstart event, to put a link to local,
and when the item is dropped to outside of content, like tabs bar, the link is opened,
bypassing privilege check.

I'm not sure how to answer to the [bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks") comment, without explaining [bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks") and this bug.
thinking about the case that items are dragged from outside of Firefox, the patch in [bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks") should be fine.
but if the items are dragged from web content (the case that I totally overlooked), it doesn't work as expected (actually, I'm not sure what's really expected...),
any items won't be opened since the items aren't holded in parent process.
what would be the option in security point of view?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

> without explaining

Looking at the spec [1] it seems that modifying the data within "dragstart" is fine as long as we are not in 'drop' mode:
> If e is dragstart, set the drag data store mode to the read/write mode.
> If e is drop, set the drag data store mode to the read-only mode.
If we are dropping (which we already can detect in the parent process, right?) then we should switch to read/only mode for content, so that the following 'setData()' calls are simply ignored:
> window.addEventListener("dragstart", function(event) {
> var dt = event.dataTransfer;
> dt.setData("text/plain", "file:///");
> });
Ultimately, if in drop mode, then we should reuse the information we have already stored in the parent. E.g. use the data from mVerifyDropLinks from [Bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks").

e is the event and when "dragstart" event it won't be "drop".
so, yes, data can be modified by web content if the dragstart happens inside web content.

the issue is that, "when we store what information" on parent process,
if web content can (and is allowed to) modify the information.
possible scenario would be:
1. store not-yet-modified dataTransfer information before dragstart
2. store possibly-modified dataTransfer information after dragstart
3. store possibly-modified dataTransfer information before drop event
1 means we'll ignore data modified by web content.
2 and 3 would use information from possibly-compromised child process...

I guess I can't completely follow, but maybe I don't fully understand how it all works together. My thinking is, that if within SendRealDragEvent(), we check:
> if (aEvent.mMessage == eDrop) {
If that branch is entered, then we store all links to be dragged/dropped within a member variable on the parent, e.g. mVerifyDropLinks [1]. \*AND\* we also mark the datatransfer to be read only from that point on, so that a compromised child can't modify those links.

I think this is what we should do, at least that's how interpret the spec.
Maybe what would help me is a usecase when a child should be allowed to modify the datatransfer that doesn't end up in a drop event within the browser.

iiuc, dataTransfer is already made read-only for drop event.
(trying to modify dataTransfer there throws error, at least on web content)
then, about the timing, there are 2 cases, items are dragged from outside of Firefox, and items are dragged from inside of Firefox (maybe web content).
for former case, what we observe first would be dragover (or dragenter?), so we should store information at that point, and in that case web content cannot modify the data.
for latter case, we'll trigger dragstart, so we should store the information before running any event handler (so that the data won't be modified, but possibly empty for some case).
then, about testing, I think we cannot test every case in automated tests (if we can, we won't use the current complicated way...)
maybe it needs manual testing, and also the current testing way would become invalid (since the assumption about who can modify the data could become invalid).

I think for this bug, Chrome's behavior seems reasonable to me, can we also ignore file:/// from web content? I am not sure what the best way to implement that is though.
As for other bugs:
\* [bug 1379838](/show_bug.cgi?id=1379838 "NEW"), [bug 1379838](/show_bug.cgi?id=1379838 "NEW"): They don't seem like super serious concerns to me (though they are valid). Anyway, I don't think it's a big concern. The most important one of the three, is definitely this one.
\* [bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks"): Once we have fixed this bug I think we can move on with [bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks").

sorry for being late for working on this.
about [bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks"), given that web content is allowed to modify the dataTransfer, I guess what we need to do is:
1. store dataTransfer data in parent process if the drag-and-drop is from outside of web content
(like, drag-and-drop from desktop)
2. let web content modify dataTransfer in dragstart event, if they want
3a. if the URLs returned from content process are same as stored, open them with system principal
(since it's what user dropped)
3b. if the URLs returned from content process are different than stored (or nothing is stored),
open them with the content's principal
(so, if the web content is not file:///, they cannot open file:///)
with that way, the testcases failed in [bug 1370843 comment #25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks") could keep working.
about opening too many tabs, we could add limitation only to 3b case.
I'll look into this bug hopefully tonight, or tomorrow.

so, the issue here is that simply because we're not passing the page's principal on e10s, that results in using system principal:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/52285ea5e54c73d3ed824544cef2ee3f195f05e6/toolkit/content/widgets/browser.xml#1573>
> this.droppedLinkHandler(null, links);
compared to non-e10s case:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/52285ea5e54c73d3ed824544cef2ee3f195f05e6/browser/base/content/tabbrowser.xml#7291-7301>

> ? dt.mozSourceNode.nodePrincipal
> : Services.scriptSecurityManager.getSystemPrincipal();
> this.tabbrowser.loadTabs(urls, {

so, I think it should be addressed at the same time as [bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks"), in the way described in [comment #15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1379842#c15 "VERIFIED FIXED - Web content can open local files by hooking drag and drop to outside of content").

Sorry, I was mixing totally different code paths.
the code used when dropping onto tab is following, both on e10s and non-e10s:
> <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/>
> 52285ea5e54c73d3ed824544cef2ee3f195f05e6/browser/base/content/tabbrowser.

> > ? dt.mozSourceNode.nodePrincipal
> > : Services.scriptSecurityManager.getSystemPrincipal();
> > this.tabbrowser.loadTabs(urls, {
> > ...
> > triggeringPrincipal,
> > });
on non-e10s, `dt.mozSourceNode` is BODY or something inside the content, and `dt.mozSourceNode.nodePrincipal` returns the page's principal,
on e10s, `dt.mozSourceNode` is browser, and `dt.mozSourceNode.nodePrincipal` returns system principal.
we should not use `dt.mozSourceNode.nodePrincipal` when it's browser (or browser's nodePrincipal should return content's principal)

Attached patch

[Check content principal when dragging and dropping from browser.](attachment.cgi?id=8894396&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8894396&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1379842&attachment=8894396)

Looks like browser element has contentPrincipal property, and using it can block dropping file:/// from http://.
with this change, ContentAreaDropListener#\_validateURI throws error while
ContentAreaDropListener#dropLinks, in drop event handler in tabbrowser,
and no tab is added when file:/// text is dropped onto tab.
I guess we need similar change for other places that uses mozSourceNode (like browser.xml), and also nsDocShellTreeOwner::HandleEvent, for the case that link is dropped onto other firefox window.
Then, I have the following question:
1. what's the appropriate way to detect xul:browser element?
(currently this patch is using nodeName, but I don't think it's correct way)
2. is contentPrincipal affected by compromised content process?Assignee: nobody → arai.unmhtStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

thank you for your feedback :)
so, here's what we achieve with the patch:
1. by checking contentPrincipal, non-file:/// page cannot open file:/// page through modifying drag-and-drop dataTransfer
(the main target of this bug)
2. contentPrincipal cannot become system principal even if the content process is compromised
(considering [bug 1370843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370843 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide correct triggeringPrincipal for dropLinks") etc)
3. principal gets checked inside parent process, so compromised content process cannot affect that logic
and what we need to check:
4. whether compromised normal (not-file) content process can return file:/// principal through contentPrincipal or not
(so, whether we have a logic that checks the consistency between contentPrincipal and the type of the content process)
anyway, issue related to compromised content process can be left to other bug, as long as this solution can be used even after addressing it.
and looks like that's the case. addressing compromised content process can be handled around contentPrincipal getter or somewhere near there.

this patch depends on [bug 1363977](/show_bug.cgi?id=1363977 "RESOLVED FIXED - Have loadTabs() provide the correct triggeringPrincipal"), that depends on [bug 1309049](/show_bug.cgi?id=1309049 "RESOLVED FIXED - move embedding/ files out of that directory") and [bug 1314254](/show_bug.cgi?id=1314254 "RESOLVED FIXED - Change IPDL message handlers return value to mozilla::Result or nsresult or just MOZ_CRASH"), which is huge.
I'm not sure if they can be safely uplifted, or if this patch can be modified to skip them...
(response to [bug 1317023](/show_bug.cgi?id=1317023 "RESOLVED FIXED - e10s - Address bar spoof using privileged URI schemes in drag n drop"))
smaug, I think this patch is not easily uplifted to esr52, and also this patch contains IDL change.
do you think it's better investigate some more about the way to uplift?

This is a sec-moderate only. How eager are we to fix this in esr52?
Perhaps Daniel has an opinion?
FWIW, I don't think [bug 1314254](/show_bug.cgi?id=1314254 "RESOLVED FIXED - Change IPDL message handlers return value to mozilla::Result or nsresult or just MOZ_CRASH") is really relevant, nor [bug 1309049](/show_bug.cgi?id=1309049 "RESOLVED FIXED - move embedding/ files out of that directory").
Sure, one would need to rebase patches quite a bit, but functionality shouldn't change.Flags: needinfo?(bugs) → needinfo?(dveditz)

[use length only, not a pointer](attachment.cgi?id=8882762&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8882762&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1377618&attachment=8882762)

This is a regression caused by [Bug 1179338](/show_bug.cgi?id=1179338 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't require that the signature method for certificate verify is identical with PRF, support alternatives"), but I only noticed it when I made some changes to the sslBuffer functions.
In TLS 1.2, handshake hashes are calculated at the time they are needed. The handshake hashes are tweaked to include a pointer to the message buffer in the field pointer\_to\_hash\_input:
<https://searchfox.org/nss/rev/b5e2bb64574eefa20a9143d908bd4e09a125070e/lib/ssl/ssl3con.c#11668>
This is necessary because the hashes need to cover the previous handshake message, but not the current message. Later in the same function, the saved transcript is updated with the current message. ssl3\_UpdateHandshakeHashes() is called to add the current handshake message. For TLS 1.2, this means appending those to ss->ssl3.hs.messages, which is an sslBuffer.
The problem is that if the handshake transcript exceeds the space available in the current buffer, a new buffer will be allocated. This is fairly unlikely, because the buffer is initialized to (MAX\_FRAGMENT\_LENGTH + 2048), which is 18k. However, if the handshake transcript up and including the client Certificate is almost 18k, then this reallocation will occur when handling the CertificateVerify as the total transcript goes over 18k.
The value of pointer\_to\_hash\_input is left pointing at a freed buffer and you get a UAF when the handshake hashes (needed to verify the client's signature) are calculated.
I only noticed this because I changed sslBuffer\_Grow to start at a lower initial value and it happened.
The fix here is pretty simple. I've attached a patch. I plan to land this as part of a bunch of other work, which should hide the change, however that is only on a branch currently and won't merge into NSS proper for some time.
Kai, do you think we need to land this in trunk or uplift it anywhere?

Martin, thanks for reporting this bug.
Since Daniel marked this as sec-high, I think we should fix it for firefox-ESR, which would mean fixing the NSS 3.28.x branch.
The question is which timing we should use. The next release opportunity is August 8, not sure if we can/should turn around that quickly, or rather target the September 26.
I think that we should fix the ESR branch an a future regular Firefox release with the identical timing.
So, it's either:
(a)
Aug 8
Firefox 55 + NSS 3.31.x
Firefox ESR 52.3 + NSS 3.28.x
or:
(b)
Sep 26
Firefox 56 + NSS 3.32.x
Firefox ESR 52.4 + NSS 3.28.x
Because this is rated sec-high, we might want to delay the NSS trunk commit until closer to the intended release date.
Daniel, any thoughts on the preferred timing from the Mozilla side?Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Note that I missed the "Firefox not affected" part. It is, via WebRTC - a case where we always use client authentication, so it's perhaps more likely than otherwise.Whiteboard: Server only; Firefox not affected → Server only

I don't have much of a preference. Earlier is usually better but we're coming up pretty close to the 55 release.

Mozilla usually assigns CVEs for NSS. You can use [CVE-2017-7805](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7805) for this one.Alias: CVE-2017-7805Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Whiteboard: Server only → (can affect Firefox via WebRTC)

I don't think so. It wasn't causing that many stability issues, had at least one serious uncaught regression, and I'm not really worried about a racy shutdown bug being turned into an exploit.

Dan, Gerry, do you think we should postpone creation of NSS branch releases and uplifting to Firefox branches until late in the Firefox release cycle, to avoid drawing attention to this fix?
(I think any creation of an NSS release branch rings a bell for anyone looking for exploits.)

I didn't receive bugmail for [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=1377618#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - Potential UAF in TLS 1.2 server when verifying client authentication"), 23, 24.
Last I had received was for [comment 20](/show_bug.cgi?id=1377618#c20 "RESOLVED FIXED - Potential UAF in TLS 1.2 server when verifying client authentication").
I wonder what's wrong and which other emails I've missed.
The key in my bugzilla secure email preferences is a S/MIME cert that has expired in 2013 already, so that wouldn't explain why it stopped working recently.
Maybe I should replace that with a currently valid GPG key...

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
