Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7579:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of PHP's `filter_input()` function with the `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` flag when sanitizing user-supplied strings within the FAQ saving functionality of phpMyFAQ. This sanitization method is insufficient to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input when saving new FAQs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected FAQs.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The use of `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` is not sufficient to prevent XSS vulnerabilities, as it does not remove or escape characters that can be used to construct malicious HTML or JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into FAQs, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the browsers of users who view the manipulated content.
- **Session Hijacking:** Malicious JavaScript can be used to steal session cookies, enabling attackers to take over user accounts.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to external websites hosting malware or execute malicious payloads directly within the context of the vulnerable website.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance of the website or display misleading content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **FAQ Submission:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the question or answer fields when creating or editing FAQs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit FAQs.
- **Understanding of XSS:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft malicious JavaScript code that will execute in a browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub commit diff shows that the fix involved sanitizing the `question` field before display using `PMF_Filter::filterVar` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`. This was added in the `getTopTenData` and `getLatestData` functions. The original code was missing sanitization in these parts of the code.
- The phpMyFAQ team acknowledged the vulnerability and released version 2.9.7 to address it.
- No workaround other than upgrading to 2.9.7 is provided.
