Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the way macOS and iOS handle XPC messages and entitlement checks. Specifically, the `SecTaskCreateWithAuditToken` function uses only the process ID (PID) and not the PID generation number (p_idversion) when creating a `SecTaskRef`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition in the entitlement checking mechanism.
- **Inadequate PID Tracking:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that `SecTaskCreateWithAuditToken` doesn't consider the process generation number (`p_idversion`). This allows a malicious process to potentially impersonate another process after a crash and restart.
- **Insufficient Entitlement Checks:** While entitlement checks exist, the race condition undermines their effectiveness.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local application can send privileged XPC messages without possessing the necessary entitlements, potentially bypassing access controls.
- This could lead to an application communicating with services it's not supposed to have access to.
- Access to privileged information protected by entitlements could be gained.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local exploitation:** This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **XPC Messages:** Exploitation involves sending XPC messages to a target daemon.
- **Process manipulation:** The attacker process manipulates process crashes and restarts to win a race condition and impersonate another process by reusing it's PID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target macOS or iOS system.
- **Ability to send XPC messages:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with target daemons via XPC.
- **Ability to cause process crashes:** The attacker has to be able to crash/force restarts of the target process in order to wrap the PID.
- **Timing control:** Precise timing/message sending is needed to win the race condition.

**Additional notes from the provided content:**

- The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) targeting `com.apple.corecaptured` service.
- The PoC shows that a process without the `com.apple.corecapture.manager-access` entitlement can communicate with the target service.
- The PoC involves sending an XPC message and then causing a process with the required entitlement to crash/restart to exploit the race.
