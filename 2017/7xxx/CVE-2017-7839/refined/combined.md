## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 57

Announced
November 14, 2017
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 57

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

##### References

* [Bug 1406750](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406750)
* [Bug 1412252](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412252)

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

##### References

* [Bug 1408990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990)

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

##### References

* [Bug 1392026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026)

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1370497](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497)

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

##### References

* [Bug 1402363](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363)

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1401339](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339)

#### [#CVE-2017-7837: SVG loaded as <img> can use meta tags to set cookies](#CVE-2017-7837)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

SVG loaded through `<img>` tags can use `<meta>` tags within the SVG data to set cookies for that page.

##### References

* [Bug 1325923](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923)

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

##### References

* [Bug 1399540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540)

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

##### References

* [Bug 1402896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896)

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

##### References

* [Bug 1366420](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366420)

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.

* [Bug 1397064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064)

#### [#CVE-2017-7827: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 57](#CVE-2017-7827)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3223.0 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Visit <https://www.bayden.com/test/controlchars.html>
2. Select all of the text in the box on the page \*except\* the first character
3. Copy
4. Go to Address bar.
5. Hit paste.
Actual results:
JavaScript is pasted and executes if enter is hit.
Expected results:
Text up to and including "JavaScript:" should be stripped.
Firefox, like Chrome and IE, attempts to prevent the user from pasting JavaScript into the address bar.
Unfortunately, as discovered in <https://crbug.com/766010>, these protections can be circumvented by introducing leading control characters into the string.

Eric: thanks for the report!
I would like to mark this sec-low and open it up, given the chrome bug items are all public and that this isn't \*much\* better for a malicious actor than saying something like "copy-paste 'iavascript:alert(...)' and replace the first 'i' with 'j' in the location bar".
(It's obviously a little better, and we should fix it, but the control characters sure look... odd... and this is all just a best-effort type thing anyway.)Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Why is this even a valid URL? Sure, we strip whitespace and a couple of these count but we're left with what should be an invalid scheme <junk>javascript: or treating them as two tokens in which case it should be a search.
The patch here looks fine and works, just wondering if we have a separate issue with the Address Bar. If you create a link with that text as the "src" it's an invalid link and does nothing. Something in the Address Bar is parsing that out and throwing it away before handing the URL part off. Probably should not be that helpful -- let the user clean up the junk, or trigger a search (which is what happens if I put a non-CTRL char in the middle of the junk).Group: firefox-core-securityFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [csectype-other](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-other&resolution=---),

I think this is a VERY GOOD question!
And I agree that the patch doesn't fully cover the problem.
I think it all boils down to this:
Services.uriFixup.getFixupURIInfo(` javascript:alert("Malicious. " + document.cookie)//<https://fake>`, Ci.nsIURIFixup.FIXUP\_FLAG\_FIX\_SCHEME\_TYPOS |
Ci.nsIURIFixup.FIXUP\_FLAG\_ALLOW\_KEYWORD\_LOOKUP).preferredURI.spec
In practice, the Location Bar trusts uriFixup to make proper choices, looks like in this case it's indeed doing a nice fixup, but it's excessive.

Uhh, so:
makeURI(" javascript:alert(document.cookie)")
also produces the correct URI.
So I don't think this is URI fixup as much as it is URI parsing. In fact, reading:
<https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser>
I think this is correct per-spec. In particular:
> If url is not given:
> 1) Set url to a new URL.
> 2) If input contains any leading or trailing C0 control or space, validation error.
> 3) Remove any leading and trailing C0 control or space from input.
Note that "validation error" does not mean parsing terminates, per <https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#validation-error> .

Bugzilla is being "helpful" and sanitizing input, but this should be something along the lines of:
makeURI("\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006javascript:alert(document.cookie)")
(where makeURI is for all intents and purposes an alias of Services.io.newURI)

This doesn't match what I'm seeing on 57:
data:text/html,<a href="%01%02%03%04%05%06%07%08%10%11%12%13%14%15%16%17%18%19javascript:alert(location.href);">Click</a>
works if clicked. I think we're dropping stuff after %00 at some point, presumably prior to it arriving at the URI parser, which is presumably also why [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Specially-crafted JavaScript may be pasted into the address bar") suggests selecting everything except the first character (which is a null byte instead of all the non-zero C0 control characters). :-)

Per the standard these are removed by the URL parser as you found in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Specially-crafted JavaScript may be pasted into the address bar"). I'll leave the needinfo for Valentin since I don't know where we implement that in our stack. Note that per the URL Standard U+0000 NULL would be removed too, that not happening here is strange and maybe indicative of another subtle issue.
Furthermore, if there is any address bar sanitization, that should take place after parsing the URL into an object, not before. Only at that point can you trust the definitive scheme.

We don't parse as a URL at the point of pasting (only when the user hits go/enter/whatever to load the final URL), and we don't want unsanitized content to enter the url bar, so the only way to do this is to duplicate the exact URI fixup that the url bar's autocomplete/navigation code uses later on, and do the exact same thing at the point of pasting, which is also fragile. :-(
> Only at that point

Not really... URI fixup might either change the scheme of a valid URL, or come up with a valid URL (which may be a search URL) even if URL parsing itself failed.

Fixup makes sense, but to figure out if it's scheme is X you should really consider roundtripping through the parser. Or maybe add some very visible comment to point out which pieces of code need to be kept in sync for security purposes and hope that folks pay attention... Or alternatively add some logic to the navigation code that enforces the restrictions the address bar wants to keep.

Unfortunately we still want to allow people to do user-initiated toplevel js: navigation because bookmarklets and the like (obviously pages do lots of this stuff with <a href="javascript:..."> anyway, but if we wanted to we could batten down the URL bar / bookmarks hatches - we just don't (want to close them completely)). So instead we just try to make it harder for malicious actors.
TBH, I wonder if the time has come to stick that type of thing behind a pref (browser.urlbar.javascript.enabled ?) and force a dialog if the user tries to navigate to a JS URL (with either the url bar or bookmarks or drag/drop) without that pref flipped.

Separate bug? Seems reasonable for copy-and-paste or user-entered javascript URLs. (Though we should also consider restricting the developer tools on release in that case if we haven't already as it's pretty similar attack-wise.)

Restricting the Developer Tools console so that all forms of pasted JavaScript won't run seems like an idea likely to provoke outrage.
Or is something else being suggested here?

I think if we clearly communicate why we'd make such a change and what steps can be taken as workaround (e.g., use the Developer's Edition) it might turn out okay. As I said we wouldn't be the first browser to do it and it's an attack vector that's being used against end users.

This is done in nsSimpleURI/nsStandardURL::SetSpec [1][2] by calling net\_FilterAndEscapeURI/net\_FilterURIString [3] which strips whitespace at the beginning and end of the string.

We do strip out the leading U+0000 too for example this:
var url = new URL("\u0000\u0001\u0002javascript:alert('hello')"); url.href
It's possible some calls pass around regular C strings when creating URLs, which causes stuff after \0 to be ignored.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0
Build ID: 20170824053838
Steps to reproduce:
1. Created the attached PoC HTML page, which contains a hyperlink to a fake A-label subdomain (xn--accountlogin) of a valid IDN (xn--google.com).
2. Opened the attached PoC HTML page in the latest released version of Firefox (55.0.3)
3. Hovered over the hyperlink
4. Observed the display of the hyperlink URL
Actual results:
The displayed URL was "xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com".
Expected results:
The displayed URL should be "xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com".
An issue that makes this slightly more serious is that some URL scanning and phishing services will fail to detect the URL, since they assume the browser will display “xn--google.com” in its UNICODE format, and not its Punycode format, and that the URL is therefore not deceptive. They do this to avoid false positives for Punycode domains that happen by chance to have a deceptive substring, but are not themselves deceptive. The ability to force Firefox to display bare Punycode makes such URLs dangerous again.
The attached Proof of Concept demonstrates that an attacker could register a Punycode spoof domain (such as xn--google.com) and then specify a Fake A-label subdomain so that the Punycode spoof domain name is displayed in its Punycode representation. In this proof of concept, we demonstrate that a Fake A-label subdomain of "xn--accountlogin" incorrectly causes the parent label "xn--google" to be rendered as Punycode. We expect the correct behavior to be that the rendering of parent name labels to be independent of child label values. In other words, we believe the correct rendering of this domain name to be "xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com", not "xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com". It should be noted that the latest released version of Chrome and Safari consistently display this domain name as "䕮䕵䕶䕱.com" regardless of child label values.

The spoofiness of xn--google.com is noted in the Unicode specs: <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/#Punycode_Spoofs>
By itself, or paired with an ascii subdomain, it's handled correctly. Why is adding a xn--accountlogin label breaking things?
The hover text can be spoofed programmatically anyway so I'm less concerned about that than the domain display when you finally do navigate. If we fix that it will fix the hover text.Component: Untriaged → Address Bar

Although xn--google.com happens to be a valid IDN, some spoofy xn-- names might not be and then they'd stay punycode per spec.Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Curious.
It looks to me like this is a bug in nsIDNService::ACEtoUTF8. Note the comment at [1] which refers to RFC 3490 (now superseded, but that's beside the point here). This says that "If any step fails, then the original input sequence is returned...", and sure enough, we do that in the loop at [2] (and again for the last fragment at [3]).
Trouble is, the text in RFC 3490 that was referred to here[4] is talking about a \*single\* label ("a sequence of Unicode code points that make up one label"), not the entire IDN that may be made up of a sequence of labels. But we call ACEtoUTF8 on the complete domain name (e.g. "www.xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com") that we're intending to display, and it handles looping over the string and converting each dot-delimited substring.
So the bug is that when we encounter a decoding failure on \*any\* of the individual labels in the string ACEtoUTF8 is processing, we immediately return the complete unchanged input for the \*whole\* IDN. What we should be doing, I think, is considering such failures independently for each label: if decodeACE fails for an individual label, then that individual label (only) should be left in its original form, but the remaining labels may still be separately decoded.
I'll attach a patch that fixes this, though we'll need to check what else it might impact...

The patch above fixes the domain display when you navigate to the example site; however, it does \*not\* seem to affect the hover text. I'm not sure offhand what that depends on...

Actually, we don't seem to decode the punycode labels for the hover text even if they're all valid: "<http://www.xn--google.com/>" displays as such in the hover text, even though it becomes <http://www.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com/> in the URL bar.

Failure to decode an individual label within the IDN should not block decoding of other valid punycode labels
AFAICS, this has been handled incorrectly for the case of processing an entire domain (rather than just a single label) ever since the ACEtoUTF8 method was first introduced, back in [bug 196717](/show_bug.cgi?id=196717 "RESOLVED FIXED - Decode ACE to UTF-8").
We don't appear to have any tests that are affected by this, so I'll look into adding some coverage.

[Comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox IDN display vulnerability") seems like the right analysis to me. This is a different class of problem to the other "spoofing" issues we've encountered recently; this is simply a bug.

Looks like there's an additional, related problem that we should also fix: calling nsIDNService::ConvertToDisplayIDN with something like "xn--google.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com" (with the default profile) returns, as expected, "䕮䕵䕶䕱.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com".
But calling it with "xn--x.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com" (where "xn--x" is not a valid punycode label) returns the mangled result "xn--xn--x-pm43a.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com".
Simple testcase:
data:text/html;charset=utf-8,<a href="<http://xn--x.%E4%95%AE%E4%95%B5%E4%95%B6%E4%95%B1.com>">test</a>
Here, the hover text appears as "xn--xn--x-pm43a.xn--google.com", with incorrect subdomain; and after navigating, the URL bar shows the destination as "xn--xn--x-pm43a.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com".
So an additional patch will be needed, I think.

Attached patch

[patch 2 - Handle invalid punycode better in stringPrep to avoid mangling display of fake-punycode labels](attachment.cgi?id=8908594&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8908594&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1399540&attachment=8908594)

The issue in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox IDN display vulnerability") arises during stringPrep calls made by nsIDNService::Normalize, because ICU's uidna\_labelToUnicode will append U+FFFD to a label that contains invalid punycode, which confuses our subsequent processing. It also returns an error flag, but we're currently ignoring that. :( By detecting this error and stripping the extra REPLACEMENT CHARACTER from such a label, we can fix the garbled result we're getting for such labels.

Attached patch

[Add some IDN testcases with mixed punycode and non-punycode labels](attachment.cgi?id=8908596&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8908596&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1399540&attachment=8908596)

This adds a few IDN tests that relate to the two bugs being fixed here. (It was when trying to create such tests for the first patch that I noticed the broken processing of invalid labels described in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox IDN display vulnerability"), and fixed by the second patch.) Both the above patches are needed in order for these to pass successfully.

This does make sense, and it's certainly a step in the right direction.
But other browsers fail URL parsing when failing to decode ACE labels. I'm wondering if we should do the same.

In what sense do they fail? AFAICT, with the PoC here Chrome accepts the "xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com" address and tries to navigate there, ending up at a domain-parking page for "www.xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com"; this is the same behavior we get once the patches here are applied.

I was trying out one of your tests in Chrome:
var url = new URL("<http://xn--accountlogin.xn--google>"); url.href
> "<http://xn--accountlogin.xn--google/>"
var url = new URL("<http://xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com>");
> VM146:1 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL
> at <anonymous>:1:11
> (anonymous) @ VM146:1
Edge had a similar behaviour. I guess we should leave that for a follow up.

Interesting... so Chrome's URL parsing rejects the mixed form "<http://xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com>" but accepts "<http://xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com>", although AFAICT the two should be equivalent. IMO it would make more sense that either -both- of these should be rejected on the basis that they include an invalid-ACE label, or neither should be rejected (at the parsing level, although the invalid label will never be successfully resolved). But further study of the relevant specs may be needed to see whether there's any clear statement on this.
So yes, sounds like something to consider for a followup.

To follow up on this, I tried reading the URL parsing algorithm[1] and AFAICT, it looks like Chrome is in error here (which is comforting, given its apparent inconsistency).
The algorithm depends on a "host parser"[2] which in turn uses a "domain to ASCII"[3] algorithm based on Unicode's ToASCII[4]. This basically splits the domain on dots, and then punycode-encodes any labels that contain non-ASCII characters; but I don't see anything that requires an invalid-ACE label like "xn--accountlogin" to result in a validation failure, nor any justification for treating this differently depending on whether a separate label within the domain contained non-ASCII chars (and therefore was punycode-encoded by ToASCII).
It's entirely possible, of course, that I've overlooked something; there are a lot of scattered pieces of spec involved here!

And FWIW, Safari agrees with us here, that the two cases "xn--x.xn--google" and "xn--x.䕮䕵䕶䕱" are treated identically:
> new URL("<http://xn--x.xn--google.com>")
< URL {href: "<http://xn--x.xn--google.com/>", origin: "<http://xn--x.xn--google.com>", protocol: "http:", username: "", password: "", …}
> new URL("<http://xn--x.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com>")
< URL {href: "<http://xn--x.xn--google.com/>", origin: "<http://xn--x.xn--google.com>", protocol: "http:", username: "", password: "", …}
Whereas Chrome, as you note, rejects the latter version with a TypeError.
