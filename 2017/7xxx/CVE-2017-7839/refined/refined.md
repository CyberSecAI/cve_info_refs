{
  "CVE-2017-7839": {
    "description": "Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.",
    "root_cause": "The regular expression used to strip javascript: URLs from pasted text in the address bar did not account for control characters, allowing them to bypass the sanitization.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Bypass of self-XSS prevention mechanism",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript execution through the address bar, enabling self-XSS attacks, could lead to account takeover or data exfiltration if social engineering convinces the user to paste the malicious code.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker relies on social engineering to convince the victim to copy a specially crafted string containing control characters followed by a javascript: URL and paste it into the browser's address bar.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious string with control characters before a javascript: URL, and the capability to convince the user to copy and paste it.",
