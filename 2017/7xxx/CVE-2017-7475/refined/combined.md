# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2017-7475 Cairo-1.15.4 Denial-of-Service Attack due to Logical Problem in Program

---

*From*: 李琪 <pjqruc () gmail com>

*Date*: Fri, 28 Apr 2017 14:34:38 +0800

---

```
Hello,

## Overview
I and my colleague have found a vulnerability of Cairo-1.15.4 when fuzzing
HarfBuzz with AFL.
Cairo is a 2d graphics library, and HarBuzz is an OpenType text shaping
engine which contains a tool named *hb-view* to give a graphical view of
text using Cairo with a font provided by user.
Owing to logical problem in program, the crash happens during null pointer
deference and the vulnerability will cause a denial-of-service attack with
a crafted font file.

## Note
I have reported this issue to cairo and here is the link:
<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100763>.

When I disclosure to Red Hat Product Security, they suggest me to use
CVE-2017-7475 for this issue and I have communicated this number to
upstream.

Best Regards,

--
Jiaqi Peng, Bingchang Liu @ VARAS of IIE

So it's not nice to put cairo_t in an error state and     refuse any further drawying.          Many PDF files are created using buggy software and cause such glpyh-not-fou nd     errors for CID 0 for example.          Eventually we should propagate these kind of errors up and return it from     the function call causing it, but that needs API change to add return value     to all text functions, so for now we just ignore these errors. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=100763#c5)  Jiaqi Peng    2017-05-04 16:00:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Chris Wilson from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=100763#c4)) > That was a lot of rigmarole where the simple gdb bt would suffice. >  > Issue stems from commit 79d975f84bcc32e91db517d71a7312e2e1d653d4 > Author: Behdad Esfahbod <behdad@behdad.org> > Date:   Wed Sep 12 17:45:11 2007 -0400 >  >     [cairo-ft-font] Ignore FT_Load_Glyph errors other than out-of-memory >     Same for FT_Render_Glyph. >      >     When the user asks us to render a glyph that is not available in the > font, >     it's mostly an unavoidable kind of error for them, as in, they can't >     avoid such a call.

I have sensed that you already make some consideration about the error propagation. However the solution taken now really will cause some unexpected results, such as the upper application using cairo may crash.  I report and disclosure this issue, so that the upper developers can pay some attention to this problem and take some defense measures as soon as possible. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=100763#c6)  Antonio Larrosa    2017-05-04 17:38:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 131213](attachment.cgi?id=131213 "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=131213&action=edit "proposed patch") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=100763&attachment=131213) proposed patch  I tested that this patch fixes the problem. It also can be fixed with better error propagation as stated previously, but in any case, I think it's sane to check for NULL before using memcpy. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=100763#c7)  GitLab Migration User    2018-08-25 13:34:58 UTC  ``` -- GitLab Migration Automatic Message --  This bug has been migrated to freedesktop.org's GitLab instance and has been closed from further activity.
