src/ : Move to a variable length header buffer

```
Previously, the `psf->header` buffer was a fixed length specified by
`SF_HEADER_LEN` which was set to `12292`. This was problematic for
two reasons; this value was un-necessarily large for the majority
of files and too small for some others.

Now the size of the header buffer starts at 256 bytes and grows as
necessary up to a maximum of 100k.
```

Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound
(such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard
library interface. It is released in source code format under the
[Gnu Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).

The library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but should compile
and run on just about any Unix (including MacOS X).
There are also pre-compiled binaries available for 32 and 64 bit windows.

It was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and big-endian
(such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on little-endian (such as Intel
and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems as well as big-endian processor systems such
as Motorola 68k, Power PC, MIPS and Sparc.
Hopefully the design of the library will also make it easy to extend for reading and
writing new sound file formats.

It has been compiled and tested (at one time or another) on the following systems:

* Every platform supported by Debian GNU/Linux including x86\_64-linux-gnu,
  i486-linux-gnu, powerpc-linux-gnu, sparc-linux-gnu, alpha-linux-gnu,
  mips-linux-gnu and armel-linux-gnu.
* powerpc-apple-darwin7.0 (Mac OS X 10.3)
* sparc-sun-solaris2.8 (using gcc)
* mips-sgi-irix5.3 (using gcc)
* QNX 6.0
* i386-unknown-openbsd2.9

At the moment, each new release is being tested on i386 Linux, x86\_64 Linux,
PowerPC Linux, Win32 and Win64.

# **Features**

libsndfile has the following main features :

* Ability to read and write a large number of file formats.* A simple, elegant and easy to use Applications Programming Interface.* Usable on Unix, Win32, MacOS and others.* On the fly format conversion, including endian-ness swapping, type conversion
        and bitwidth scaling.* Optional normalisation when reading floating point data from files containing
          integer data.* Ability to open files in read/write mode.* The ability to write the file header without closing the file (only on files
              open for write or read/write).* Ability to query the library about all supported formats and retrieve text
                strings describing each format.

libsndfile has a comprehensive test suite so that each release is as bug free
as possible.
When new bugs are found, new tests are added to the test suite to ensure that
these bugs don't creep back into the code.
When new features are added, tests are added to the test suite to make sure that
these features continue to work correctly even when they are old features.

The following table lists the file formats and encodings that libsndfile can read
and write.
The file formats are arranged across the top and encodings along the left
edge.

From version 1.0.18, libsndfile also reads and writes
[FLAC](http://flac.sourceforge.net/)
and
[Ogg/Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/).

Some of the file formats I am also interested in adding are:

* Kurzweil K2000 sampler files.* Ogg Speex.

I have decided that I will not be adding support for MPEG Layer 3 (commonly
known as MP3) due to the patent issues surrounding this file format.
See
[the FAQ](FAQ.html#Q020)
for more.

Other file formats may also be added on request.

# **History**

My first attempt at reading and writing WAV files was in 1990 or so under Windows
3.1.
I started using Linux in early 1995 and contributed some code to the
[wavplay](http://www.vaxxine.com/ve3wwg/gnuwave.html)
program.
That contributed code would eventually mutate into this library.
As one of my interests is Digital Signal Processing (DSP) I decided that as well as
reading data from an audio file in the native format (typically 16 bit short integers)
it would also be useful to be able to have the library do the conversion to floating
point numbers for DSP applications.
It then dawned on me that whatever file format (anything from 8 bit unsigned chars,
to 32 bit floating point numbers) the library should be able to convert the data to
whatever format the library user wishes to use it in.
For example, in a sound playback program, the library caller typically wants the sound
data in 16 bit short integers to dump into a sound card even though the data in the
file may be 32 bit floating point numbers (ie Microsoft's WAVE\_FORMAT\_IEEE\_FLOAT
format).
Another example would be someone doing speech recognition research who has recorded
some speech as a 16 bit WAV file but wants to process it as double precision floating
point numbers.

# **Licensing**

libsndfile is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
of which there are two versions;
[version 2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)
and
[version 3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).
To maximise the compatibility of libsndfile, the user may choose to use libsndfile
under either of the above two licenses.
You can also read a simple explanation of the ideas behind the GPL and the LGPL
[here](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html).

You can use libsndfile with
[Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/),
[Open Source](http://www.opensource.org/),
proprietary, shareware or other closed source applications as long as libsndfile
is used as a dynamically loaded library and you abide by a small number of other
conditions (read the LGPL for more info).
With applications released under the GNU GPL you can also use libsndfile statically
linked to your application.

I would like to see libsndfile used as widely as possible but I would prefer it
if you released software that uses libsndfile as
[Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/)
or
[Open Source](http://www.opensource.org/).
However, if you put in a great deal of effort building a significant application
which simply uses libsndfile for file I/O, then I have no problem with you releasing
that as closed source and charging as much money as you want for it as long as you
abide by [the license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).

# **Download**

Here is the latest version. It is available in the following formats:

* Source code as a .tar.gz :
  [libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz](files/libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz)
  and
  [GPG signature](files/libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz.asc).* Win32 installer:
    [libsndfile-1.0.28-w32-setup.exe](files/libsndfile-1.0.28-w32-setup.exe) (thoroughly tested under
    [Wine](http://www.winehq.com/))
    and
    [GPG signature](files/libsndfile-1.0.28-w32-setup.exe.asc).* Win64 installer:
      [libsndfile-1.0.28-w64-setup.exe](files/libsndfile-1.0.28-w64-setup.exe) (thoroughly tested under
      [Wine](http://www.winehq.com/))
      and
      [GPG signature](files/libsndfile-1.0.28-w64-setup.exe.asc).

The GPG signature can be validated at
[Keybase.IO](https://keybase.io/erikd/).

The Win32 installer should work on Windows Vista or later.

Pre-release versions of libsndfile are available
