Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7529:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the `ngx_http_range_parse()` function within the range filter module of nginx.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Integer overflow: A specially crafted HTTP range request can cause an integer overflow during the parsing of range headers.
- Incorrect processing of ranges: The integer overflow leads to incorrect handling of the requested ranges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:**
    -  An attacker can potentially leak the cache file header if a response was returned from the cache. The cache file header may contain sensitive information like the IP address of the backend server.
    - With certain third-party modules, exploitation could lead to the disclosure of worker process memory.
- **Denial of Service (Potential):**
    - Though not confirmed, some third-party modules might be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack via this integer overflow, by crashing the worker process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malformed "Range" header to an nginx server.
- **HTTP Range Header:** The specific attack vector involves exploiting the way nginx parses HTTP range headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable nginx server. No prior authentication or special network position is required.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** nginx versions 0.5.6 to 1.13.2 are affected.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in nginx versions 1.13.3 and 1.12.1.
- **Workaround:** A temporary workaround is to configure `max_ranges 1;` in the nginx configuration, limiting the number of ranges.
- Red Hat has issued a security advisory (RHSA-2017:2538) for this issue, with a low severity rating.
- Apple has addressed this issue in Xcode 13 by updating nginx to version 1.21.0
