Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-7939:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `read_next_pam_token` function within the `src/imagew-pnm.c` file of the ImageWorsener software. This function is used when processing PAM (Portable Arbitrary Map) image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `read_next_pam_token` function copies data into a fixed-size stack buffer named `linebuf` without proper bounds checking. If the input data exceeds the buffer's capacity, it overflows, overwriting adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The buffer overflow can lead to program crashes and termination.
- **Unspecified Impact:** The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions "other unspecified impact," suggesting that, under certain circumstances, the vulnerability could potentially be used to achieve more severe outcomes like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted PAM Image Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious PAM image file with excessive data that triggers the overflow when processed by ImageWorsener.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The Gentoo advisory indicates this vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can provide a malicious image file to a user, which will trigger the vulnerability when processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a crafted PAM image file to a user who will then process it with ImageWorsener. This could be done through a website, email, or any medium where an image file is transferred to the user.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same system as the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The github issue report `#13` shows the crash details, including the exact location of the overflow, and the affected buffer: `linebuf` which is located on stack. The overflow occurs at `src/imagew-pnm.c:282` in function `read_next_pam_token` when reading data of a specific size at offset `196` on the stack.
- The provided test case from github (`https://github.com/bestshow/p0cs/blob/master/1071-stack-buffer-overflow-imagew-pnm`) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects ImageWorsener versions prior to 1.3.1, according to the Gentoo security advisory.
