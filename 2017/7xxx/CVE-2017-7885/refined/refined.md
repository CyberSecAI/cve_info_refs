Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to integer overflow errors within the `jbig2_decode_symbol_dict` function of the jbig2dec library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the overflow, an attacker could cause the affected application to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the vulnerable application, gaining control of the system or user privileges, if crafted carefully.
- **Disclosure of sensitive information from process memory.**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted JBIG2 file, typically embedded within a PDF document or similar container formats, using an application that utilizes the vulnerable jbig2dec library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted JBIG2 file to the victim. This could be achieved through email attachments, malicious websites, or other means of file transfer.
- The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the victim's system, only to induce the user to process the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported in the jbig2dec version 0.13.
- Patches were issued to fix this vulnerability.
- Other CVEs (CVE-2017-7975 and CVE-2017-7976) were also related to integer overflows in other functions of jbig2dec, specifically `jbig2_build_huffman_table` and `jbig2_image_compose`.
