Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7779:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by multiple memory safety bugs present in Firefox 54, Firefox ESR 52.2, and Thunderbird 52.2. These bugs resulted in memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Memory safety bugs. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption.
- Use-after-free
- Buffer overflows
- Out-of-bounds read
- Improper sanitization
- Same-origin policy bypass
- Incorrect enforcement of CSP

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Execution of arbitrary code.
-  Denial of service (DoS).
-  Information disclosure.
-  Bypass of same-origin policy.
-  Incorrect enforcement of CSP.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed web content processed by the browser.
- Pages with embedded iframes during page reloads.
- Pages containing `data:` protocol and modal alerts.
- Viewing certificates with an extremely long OID.
- Manipulation of ARIA attributes within the DOM.
- Painting non-displayable SVG elements.
- Resizing image elements.
- During window resizing with `marquee` elements.
- WebSockets during disconnection.
- Deleting attached editor DOM nodes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get the target user to load or process the malformed or malicious content via a web page or through another means within the affected application.
- In some cases, such as the buffer overflow with certificate, the attacker needs a carefully crafted certificate.
- For the memory protection bypass, an attacker would need to execute malicious code in concert with another vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

- This CVE is a blanket identifier for a collection of memory safety bugs.
- The severity is classified as critical.
- The fixes for these issues are included in Firefox 55, Firefox ESR 52.3 and Thunderbird 52.3.
- Some of these vulnerabilities are specific to the Windows operating system.
- While the official CVE description is a placeholder, the provided content gives more specific details on the various root causes and attack vectors for the vulnerabilities this CVE refers to.
