Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7419:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the 'description' field of OAuth scopes within NetIQ Access Manager. This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML tags, including JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the scope description. When an OAuth client requests that scope, the injected script is executed in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser can lead to various malicious actions.
   - Session hijacking: Attackers could steal user session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account and potentially sensitive data.
   - Defacement: The attacker could alter the appearance of the web page displayed to the user.
   - Phishing: The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious page disguised as the legitimate application, allowing them to steal credentials.
   - Other malicious actions: The attacker could perform any other actions within the context of the userâ€™s session and permissions within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker could craft a malicious OAuth scope description containing JavaScript. This malicious scope would then need to be created within the vulnerable NetIQ Access Manager. 
- When a user interacts with a client application that attempts to retrieve this maliciously crafted scope, the XSS payload is triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Administrative privileges or access to create or modify OAuth client application scopes within the affected NetIQ Access Manager installation. This is necessary to inject the malicious script into the scope description field.
- The attacker would need to entice a user of a client application to interact with the vulnerable OAuth flow, triggering the execution of the injected JavaScript.

**Additional notes:**
- The identified solution is to apply the patches to the Access Manager (NAM) versions.
- The vulnerability affects NetIQ Access Manager versions 4.3 and 4.2.
- The specific fix versions are 4.3.2 and 4.2.4.
