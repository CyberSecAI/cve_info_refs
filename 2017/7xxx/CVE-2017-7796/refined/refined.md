  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Windows updater's logger deletes the log file before writing to it. The path to the log file is taken from the command line, but the filename is hardcoded as 'update.log'. This allows an attacker to specify a path to a file named 'update.log' and have the updater delete it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The updater uses a hardcoded filename ('update.log') for its log file.",
      "The updater allows the log file path to be specified via command line arguments.",
      "The updater deletes the log file before writing to it."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file deletion with the privileges of the maintenance service (high privilege).",
    "attack_vectors": "Command-line arguments to the Windows updater.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to execute the updater with crafted command-line arguments through the maintenance service."
