| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1350460#c0)• 8 years ago |
|  | |

In toolkit\crashreporter\client\crashreporter\_win.cpp, function GetStringValue, a Windows registry value is queried. If the type is REG\_SZ (i.e. a string), it copies the content of a wchar\_t stack buffer to a wstring object, which is returned to the caller.
However, in Microsoft's document [1], it warns us:
> If the data has the REG\_SZ, REG\_MULTI\_SZ or REG\_EXPAND\_SZ type,
> the string may not have been stored with the proper terminating
> null characters. Therefore, even if the function returns ERROR\_SUCCESS,
> the application should ensure that the string is properly terminated
> before using it; otherwise, it may overwrite a buffer.
In our case, because we don't prefill the |buf| with all-zero, suppose the data we read is not null-terminated, then the wstring will contain the stack memory data (which may include old eip value), until it reaches a NULL.
Whether this issue is exploitable depends on how the caller uses the wstring object and what registry value it queries. But no matter what, not ensuring the string is null-terminated is problematic.
The doc suggests to use RegGetValue function.

And there are a lots of others, like:
\* xpcom\io\SpecialSystemDirectory.cpp: GetRegWindowsAppDataFolder: |path| may not be null-terminated, and thus
int len = wcslen(path);
may not give right value.
After that,
path[len] = L'\\';
may overwrite a 2-byte memory at unintended address.
I will search it more thoroughly if you confirm this is a vulnerability.

Thank you, Gabriele! But I think there is still a small problem: if RegQueryValueEx copies exactly 2048 wide chars to |buf| and it is not null-terminated, then constructing wstring will still over-read.
This can be fixed by setting dataSize = sizeof(buf) - 1; which ensures buf has at least one \0 at the end.

Nice catch, I hadn't thought of that, updated patch coming.

Actually I had filed [Bug 1348843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348843 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - uninitialized local variable in GetRegWindowsAppDataFolder function") for the uninitialized parameter issue. I didn't realized this null-terminated string issue back then. Do need to merge that bug to this one?

Yes, there's no point in clearing the string if we leave that parameter uninitialized.

FWIW this seems pretty unlikely to be exploitable given that we only query two fixed registry keys ("Software\\Mozilla\\Crash Reporter" and possibly "Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell Folders" if SHGetFolderPath fails).
Additionally, this code is in the crashreporter client which only runs when the entire Firefox process has crashed, not the Firefox binary itself.
Thanks for the bug report!

Reporter
Antonio Sanso
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An error occurs in the elliptic curve point addition algorithm that uses mixed Jacobian-affine coordinates where it can yield a result `POINT_AT_INFINITY` when it should not. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this to interfere with a connection, resulting in an attacked party computing an incorrect shared secret.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1234401#c0)• 9 years ago |
|  | |

On Windows, the update logging system's initialization procedure includes a step that deletes the file that it plans to write to. The name of this file is hard coded as "update.log", but the path to it is read from the command line. The updater can be invoked through the maintenance service, so anyone able to execute that with the right command line can cause any file with the name update.log anywhere on the system to be deleted, using the very high privilege level that the service gets invoked at.

| [Comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1234401#c1)• 9 years ago |

Note: this is a spinoff of [bug 1212939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1212939 "VERIFIED FIXED - Maintenance Service updater File Deletion Elevation of Privilege") which makes it so only a file named update.log is affected. I am not sure there is a decent way to prevent this from happening at this time.

patch in progress
Probably fine. This doesn't accomplish all that much, but I don't think this bug merits any more.

I don't think this is worthwhile uplifting and will likely land this after the other security patches land in early May.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)

* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
