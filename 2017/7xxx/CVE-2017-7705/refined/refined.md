Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an infinite loop within the RPC over RDMA (RPCoRDMA) dissector in Wireshark. This loop occurs when processing malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core vulnerability is an infinite loop in the RPCoRDMA dissector code. This means that under specific conditions with crafted input, the dissector enters a state where it keeps processing data indefinitely without completing or terminating.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service. By providing a specially crafted packet, an attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, effectively making it unresponsive or unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Network Packet:** An attacker can inject a malformed network packet onto the network that will be processed by Wireshark.
*   **Malformed Packet Trace File:** Alternatively, an attacker could convince a user to open a malformed packet trace file containing the malicious packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access or File Access:** The attacker needs either the ability to inject network traffic (in the case of a live capture) or the ability to provide a crafted capture file to a Wireshark user.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any elevated privileges to trigger this vulnerability, as the exploit occurs within the normal dissector operation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.5, and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11.
*   The vulnerability is resolved in Wireshark versions 2.2.6 and 2.0.12 and later.
*   The issue was initially reported as bug #13558 in the old Wireshark bug tracker, which was then migrated.
*   A sample pcap file that triggers the infinite loop was provided along with the report `libfuzzer_RPCoRDMA_loop.pcap`
