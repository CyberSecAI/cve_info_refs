The provided content describes a vulnerability in Eclipse tinydtls 0.8.2, identified as CVE-2017-7243.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check for the `peer` variable before accessing `peer->handshake_params` within the `handle_ccs` function. This function is called within the `dtls_handle_message` function when processing a "Change cipher spec" message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A NULL pointer dereference exists in the `handle_ccs` function. Specifically, if a "Change cipher spec" packet is received before a DTLS handshake has been established, the `peer` variable will be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing `peer->handshake_params`.
- The code does check if a peer exists at the start of the `dtls_handle_message` function, and will return early, but the `handle_ccs()` is still called.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Sending a crafted "Change cipher spec" packet without a preceding handshake causes the DTLS peer to crash due to the NULL pointer dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. An attacker can send a malicious "Change cipher spec" packet to the vulnerable DTLS server.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a "Change cipher spec" packet is received out of order, specifically before a full DTLS handshake has been completed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable DTLS server.
- No prior authentication or specific capabilities are needed, as this is a pre-handshake issue.
- An attacker just needs to send the specially crafted 'Change cipher spec' packet without a preceding handshake to cause the crash.
