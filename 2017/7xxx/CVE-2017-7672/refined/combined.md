## Summary

Possible DoS attack when using URLValidator (similar to [S2-044](/confluence/display/WW/S2-044))

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers and users |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Possible DoS attack when using URLValidator |
| Maximum security rating | Low |
| Recommendation | Upgrade to [Struts 2.5.12](/confluence/display/WW/Version%2BNotes%2B2.5.12) |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.5 - Struts 2.5.10.1 |
| Reporter | Jonathan Bullock <jonbullock at gmail dot com> |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2017-7672 |

## Problem

If an application allows enter an URL in a form field and built-in URLValidator is used, it is possible to prepare a special URL which will be used to overload server process when performing validation of the URL.

Solution

Upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.5.12.

## Backward compatibility

No backward incompatibility issues are expected.

## Workaround

Instead of using the default RegEx provided by the `UrlValidator` you can use the below one:

```
"^(https?|ftp):\\/\\/" +
"(([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;\\?&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})+" +
"(:([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;\\?&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})+)?" +
"@)?(#?" +
")((([a-z0-9]\\.|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]\\.)*" +
"[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]" +
"|((\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\\.){3}" +
"(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])" +
")(:\\d+)?" +
")(((\\/{0,1}([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)*" +
"(\\?([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)" +
"?)?)?" +
"(#([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)?" +
"$";
```

# Oracle Security Alert Advisory - CVE-2017-9805

## Oracle Security Alert Advisory - CVE-2017-9805

### Description

The Apache Foundation’s fixes for CVE-2017-5638, an Apache Struts 2 vulnerability identified by Equifax in relation to Equifax’s recent security incident, were distributed by Oracle to its customers in the April 2017 Critical Patch Update, and should have already been applied to customer systems.

Subsequent to the Equifax breach, the Apache Foundation released fixes for a number of additional Apache Struts 2 vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-9805, CVE-2017-7672, CVE-2017-9787, CVE-2017-9791, CVE-2017-9793, CVE-2017-9804, and CVE-2017-12611). Oracle is distributing these fixes as part of this Security Alert for the benefit of our customers.

Oracle strongly recommends that the fixes contained in this Security Alert be applied without delay.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Security Alert are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Security Alert is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Security Alert Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Security Alert program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Security Alert. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Security Alert program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Security Alert program for products in the Extended Support Phase.
