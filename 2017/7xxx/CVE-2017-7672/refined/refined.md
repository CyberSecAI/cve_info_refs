Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-7672:

*   **Vulnerability Description:**

    *   CVE-2017-7672 is a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 related to the `URLValidator`. It's similar to CVE-2017-5638 (S2-044).
    *   If an application allows users to input a URL in a form field and uses the built-in `URLValidator`, a specially crafted URL can be used to overload the server during validation.
*   **Affected Software:**

    *   Apache Struts versions 2.5 to 2.5.10.1 are affected.
*   **Root Cause:**

    *   The vulnerability lies in the default RegEx used by `URLValidator`. A specially crafted URL can cause excessive processing during validation, leading to a DoS.
*   **Impact:**

    *   Successful exploitation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). The server process becomes overloaded when validating a malicious URL.
*   **Attack Vector:**

    *   An attacker can submit a malicious URL through a form field that is validated using the built-in `URLValidator`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**

    *   The attacker needs to be able to submit URL's to an application that uses the vulnerable `URLValidator`.
*   **Severity:**

    *   The maximum security rating is considered "Low" by Struts.
    *   NetApp scores it as 3.7 (LOW) with vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L.
*   **Solution:**

    *   Upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.5.12.
*   **Workaround:**

    *   Instead of using the default RegEx provided by the `UrlValidator` you can use the below one:
        ```
        "^(https?|ftp):\\/\\/" +
        "(([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;\\?&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})+" +
        "(:([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;\\?&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})+)?" +
        "@)?(#?" +
        ")((([a-z0-9]\\.|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]\\.)*" +
        "[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]" +
        "|((\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])\\.){3}" +
        "(\\d|[1-9]\\d|1\\d{2}|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])" +
        ")(:\\d+)?" +
        ")(((\\/{0,1}([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)*" +
        "(\\?([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)" +
        "?)?)?" +
        "(#([a-z0-9$_\\.\\+!\\*\\'\\(\\),;:@&=-]|%[0-9a-f]{2})*)?" +
        "$";
        ```
*   **NetApp Products:**

    *   The NetApp document (NTAP-20180706-0002) indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache Struts libraries and are thus potentially affected.
    *   Specifically, OnCommand Balance is listed as affected.  NetApp states that there are no plans to address the vulnerability in OnCommand Balance, and directs users to their EOA announcement.
