Hmm, I have no idea what causes this in IMEStateManager.
In ESR52, the crashed line (IMEStateManager.cpp:1599) is here:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-esr52/rev/efda314ebf303ea64badfaf20d0a0de7db89d00d/dom/events/IMEStateManager.cpp#1599>
> 1599 sActiveIMEContentObserver = new IMEContentObserver();
sActiveIMEContentObserver is always nullptr here (should have already returned from this method if it's not nullptr). And I don't know why creating new instance of IMEContentObserver class causes "heap-use-after-free".Flags: needinfo?(masayuki)

I was not able to reproduce this issue with or without fuzzPriv extension on Ubuntu 16.04 x64 LTS using a few affected asan builds:
- 52.1.0 esr (20170417145422)
- 51.0a1 Nightly (20160810065516)
Since I could not reproduce this crash (I've used the test case from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1359547#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in mozilla::IMEContentObserver::HandleQueryContentEvent")), I cannot confirm if this crash is fixed or not.
Nils, could you please verify this on the latest asan build 54.0 [1], 55.0a1 [2] and esr 52.2.0 [3]?
Thanks!

Hi, I retested this issue on Ubuntu 18.04 lts using the latest "Asan Fuzzin" builds with Fuzzin - enabled in about:Config on :67.0a1 (2019-03-15); 66.0; 67.0b2; 60.6.0esr.

#### [#CVE-2017-7760: File manipulation and privilege escalation via callback parameter in Mozilla Windows Updater and Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7760)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer overflows
and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code, denial of service or domain spoofing.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 52.x releases.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Attached file
[testcase.html](attachment.cgi?id=8858813)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8858813&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/57.0.2987.133 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Tested on:
- Mozilla Firefox 52.0.2 (32-bit) on Windows 10
- Nightly 55.0a1 (2017-04-10) (64-bit) on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Details:
dom/canvas/WebGLTexture.h:
..
313 ImageInfo& ImageInfoAtFace(uint8\_t face, uint32\_t level) {
314 MOZ\_ASSERT(face < mFaceCount);
315 MOZ\_ASSERT(level < kMaxLevelCount);
316 size\_t pos = (level \* mFaceCount) + face;
317 return mImageInfoArr[pos];
318 }
..
By supplying a sufficiently large value to 'level' (see the third parameter of gl.texParameterf() in the provided testcase file), it is possible to cause an out-of-bounds array access in line 317. This may result in a bogus ImageInfo object being returned to the calling function, possibly leading to an exploitable state.

Note that the attached testcase doesn't always crash instantaneously for me. Took a few seconds sometimes.

[GDB backtrace of ImageInfoAtFace()](attachment.cgi?id=8861383)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8861383&action=edit)

I took a look at this bug, and maybe have some relevant information.
First off, attached is my gdb backtrace when hitting the function ImageInfoAtFace() which triggered immediately after I continued the execution with gdb once I set the breakpoint.
From what I can tell is that |mBaseMipmapLevel| holds the value of |level| passed to the quoted function by the reporter.
Further
> gl.texParameterf(gl.TEXTURE\_CUBE\_MAP, gl.TEXTURE\_BASE\_LEVEL, 0x50);
in the testcase seems to set that member variable here [1]
The vulnerable function seems to be triggered by calling
> gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 1);
in the testcase.
In my debug build (the one I used for debugging), the MOZ\_ASSERTS, are present [2] and would cause a crash.
However since those are not MOZ\_RELEASE\_ASSERT, the reporter probably didn't hit them with his testcase.
As a side note, there are different code path that validate |mBaseMipmapLevel| to be less than |kMaxLevelCount| which in my build is 31. However in this particular code path (shown in my gdb backtrace and in the reporters windbg output) |mBaseMipmapLevel| is not validated, thus leading to the out-of-bound array access.
Also, I would consider increasing the security rating, because the object read by the out-of-bound is of the class ImageInfo [3].
Given that |mBaseMipmapLevel| is of type uint32\_t [4], the accessible memory range is pretty big (on 64 bit, and the entire memory range on 32 bit) so crafting a malicious ImageInfo object and let it be accessed by this out-of-bounds shouldn't be too hard.

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53, Firefox ESR 52.1, and Thunderbird 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1348645](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1348645)

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A mechanism where when a new tab is loaded through JavaScript events, if fullscreen mode is then entered, the addressbar will not be rendered. This would allow a malicious site to displayed a spoofed addressbar, showing the location of an arbitrary website instead of the one loaded.

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Thunderbird.
Support for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update
we're now following the 52.x releases.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:52.2.1-4~deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:52.2.1-4~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>
