### @scriptsrc **[scriptsrc](/scriptsrc)** commented [Dec 30, 2016](#issue-198113930)

* Replacing Flask-Security with Flask-Security-Fork.
* Removing some explicit dependencies to rely on flask-security-fork dependencies.
* SSO will use flask-security login\_user instead of flask-login so that security\_trackable works.
* Replacing current\_user.is\_authenticated() method with property so we can use a newer version of flask-login.
* Bumping psycopg2, bcrypt, and cryptography versions.

| Big reason to move to Flask-Security-Fork is [pallets-eco/flask-security-3.0#548](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-security-3.0/pull/548)  Without PR 548 being merged, it's vulnerable to logout redirection. Flask-Security-Fork is still receiving support. |
