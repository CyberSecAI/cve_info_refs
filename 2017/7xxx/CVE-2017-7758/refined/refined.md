    "description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability with the Opus encoder when the number of channels in an audio stream changes while the encoder is in use.",
    "root_cause": "The Opus encoder's channel configuration is not updated when the number of channels in the audio stream changes, causing an out-of-bounds read when the encoder tries to access channel data that doesn't exist.",
