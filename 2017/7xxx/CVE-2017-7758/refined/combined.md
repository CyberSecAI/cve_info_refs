This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-5470: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 54, Firefox ESR 52.2, and Thunderbird 52.2](#CVE-2017-5470)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53, Firefox ESR 52.1, and Thunderbird 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2017-7760: File manipulation and privilege escalation via callback parameter in Mozilla Windows Updater and Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7760)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

#### [#CVE-2017-7765: Mark of the Web bypass when saving executable files](#CVE-2017-7765)

Reporter
Jonathan Birch and Microsoft Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7766: File execution and privilege escalation through updater.ini, Mozilla Windows Updater, and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7766)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

An attack using manipulation of `updater.ini` contents, used by the Mozilla Windows Updater, and privilege escalation through the Mozilla Maintenance Service to allow for arbitrary file execution and deletion by the Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7767: Privilege escalation and arbitrary file overwrites through Mozilla Windows Updater and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7767)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to overwrite arbitrary files with junk data using the Mozilla Windows Updater, which runs with the Maintenance Service's privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7768: 32 byte arbitrary file read through Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7768)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-5470: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 54 and Firefox ESR 52.2](#CVE-2017-5470)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1461262#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2017-06-14 04:39:34 UTC  ``` Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Thunderbird.
Support for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update
we're now following the 52.x releases.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:52.2.1-4~deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:52.2.1-4~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer overflows
and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code, denial of service or domain spoofing.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 52.x releases.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

The issue here is that the OpusEncoder sets mChannels at Init, but the number of channels on the stream to the recorder can change in that encoder's lifetime without the encoder being updated. The AudioTrackEncoder does not anticipate this change and if newNumChannels < oldNumChannels then we end up reading out of bounds (specifically off the end of aChunk.mChannelData). This is easily reproducible as shown by the proof of concept. The out of bounds data is read into an array that expects audio channel data. It looks to me like this data will be interleaved and then fed through the opus encoder before being exposed by the media recorder API.
Would appreciate checking of my working. At this stage I think the upshot is exposure of memory (whatever follows aChunk.mChannelData), this data is fed through the opus encoder before being exposed.
Have a WIP fix, to follow shortly for feedback.

Make sure number of channels is correctly set for opus encoder
I don't think it makes sense to change the number of channels mid flight for opus (webm doesn't support this, and the opus encoder/decoder don't appear to). As such I suggest we keep the same encoder, and up or down sample to maintain the same number of channels. I've run a couple of test cases over chrome, who appear to do this.
We could also stop recording, but I prefer the above as more user friendly, barring any concerns.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The code looks good as far as avoiding a crash goes.
What happens when the number of channels increases? Do we know which channels to pick and encode?
What happens when the number of channels decreases? Do we encode silence or garbage on the ones that didn't make the cut?
Would it make more sense to abort and raise an error event instead?
Also write a crash test before landing please. The attachment would be easy to convert.

Will do on the crash test.
Does the existing upmix and downmix when interleaving code handle those cases? Would you prefer the error approach? I'm not sure which is more intuitive/useful to the user. If they're expecting a channel # change in the output file then it could be misleading to not error. However, an error would break web app compat between us and chrome.
Are these questions you'd like resolved as part of this bug, or food for thought going forward?

Is there even existing code to upmix and downmix? I see that we support mono and stereo only, but nothing about dynamic changes. Is that even supported by opus? If we want to support this we IMHO need a set of gtests to prove its functionality.
My first thought is to follow the spec. If the spec doesn't mention what to do, and what to do isn't obvious, we should raise an error to show that the feature is unsupported and no further thought has been given on the behavior. Like we did for video resolution changes until we added support and tests.
IMO compat is secondary here since it's not in the spec, and it's not a regression.

For audio playback and other reasons, we have dynamic up/down-mixers, including this one.
It handles channels on a chunk-by-chunk basis, adapting it to the target. If you're recording in stereo, it will handle a stream of mixed mono and stereo fine. Opus never sees a change in the number of tracks encoded (which is the point of this function).

This patch is just fixing a bug in the adaptive mixing to the target number of channels (which is what I think most people would expect; erroring on channels changing is not something I would anticipate as an app developer). And it already works for the mono input to a stereo recorder. (And probably usually works in the non-ASAN case, perhaps always or virtually so.)

Bryce: when landing this bug, make the test a separate patch, and do NOT check in the test with the patch unless told to by the security guys (who give security-approval)Group: media-core-security

Ah, I see now. My apologies, this is not code that I know so well. Get a test up and I or jesup can r+.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
- An attacker familiar with the media recorder and processing APIs could likely figure out how to begin exploiting this. Once an attacker has figured out that this can be done, triggering the the read off the end of the array is trivial (see the PoC or the attached test). However, the data will be fed through the opus encoder before being exposed to the attacker, which increases the difficulty of exploiting this.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
- The comment is left intentionally vague to avoid this. The code change very obviously deals with array indexing, one could likely infer that it is to avoid indexing off the end of an array. The follow up test should not be landed with this, as it paints a clear target by being a crash test. I will follow up with another bug to land it later.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
- All supported: 54, 55, and 52esr appear to be affected, as well as various older, unsupported branches.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
- All supported branches appear to be impacted.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
- I believe this patch should work for the other branches. This code doesn't look to have changed since 52[1], so the same patch should work.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
- The patch is small and specific, I do not think it likely it will cause regressions. It does slightly alter existing behaviour if users are non-maliciously changing channel counts (specifically if users create a mono recorder then change the input to stereo). However, I think questions about up and down mixing can be handled in a non secure follow up once this is seen to. Testing would be good to ensure this works, for security purposes decreasing the number of input channels appears to be the most important test. I don't think increasing the number of channels would result in the issue, but would be good to test also.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
- This test makes it clear how the code can trigger the abusable bug. Weaponising the bug would require further effort.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
- This is test that painted a target to a patched bug. Landing it has been delayed to avoid this.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
- All supported branches should be immune due to earlier patch.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
- All supported branches should be immune.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
- Backports are not needed.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
- Regressions in any other code are unlikely, any problems should be limited to the test itself.

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1348645](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1348645)

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

#### [#CVE-2017-7766: File execution and privilege escalation through updater.ini, Mozilla Windows Updater, and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7766)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

* [Bug 1342742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742)

#### [#CVE-2017-7767: Privilege escalation and arbitrary file overwrites through Mozilla Windows Updater and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7767)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

#### [#CVE-2017-7768: 32 byte arbitrary file read through Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7768)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7770: Addressbar spoofing with JavaScript events and fullscreen mode](#CVE-2017-7770)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A mechanism where when a new tab is loaded through JavaScript events, if fullscreen mode is then entered, the addressbar will not be rendered. This would allow a malicious site to displayed a spoofed addressbar, showing the location of an arbitrary website instead of the one loaded.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop Firefox is unaffected.*

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
