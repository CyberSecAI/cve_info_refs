Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error occurring during video control operations in Firefox when a `<track>` element retains a reference to an older window after that window has been replaced in the DOM. This happens when a new window is created via document.open which invalidates the old window but the track element may still have a reference to it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free, where memory associated with a freed object (the old window) is accessed again by the `<track>` element. This leads to unpredictable behavior and the potential for exploitation.
*   **Incorrect object handling:**  The code doesn't correctly manage the lifecycle of the window objects, specifically when a new window is created after an existing window is in use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Crash:** The use-after-free leads to a crash, which could cause disruption for users.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability has the potential to be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious web content:** An attacker could craft malicious web content that triggers the use-after-free condition. This can involve manipulating `<track>` elements and causing a window replacement through document.open and triggering a call to `getBoundingClientRect`.
*   **User interaction:** Specific user interaction with the video controls and page content is necessary to trigger the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Web Content:** The attacker needs the ability to serve the malicious web page to a victim user of Firefox.
*   **JavaScript execution:** The attacker needs to execute JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable web page to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Specific Element Creation Order:** The attacker needs to create certain elements in a specific order to reproduce the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by specific order in which elements are appended to a document, and the presence of an error handler on the window. 
*   The vulnerability can be fixed by delaying the execution of JavaScript until the PresShell, PresContext, and ViewManager are no longer in an inconsistent state between `DestroyPresShell` starting and finishing up `Hide()`.

This information is extracted from the various sources including the bugzilla discussions and the Red Hat Security Advisory. This detailed view goes beyond the simple CVE description, which states:

> A use-after-free vulnerability during video control operations when a <track> element holds a reference to an older window if that window has been replaced in the DOM. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.
