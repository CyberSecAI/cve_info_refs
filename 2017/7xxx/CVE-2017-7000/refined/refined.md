{
  "CVE-2017-7000": {
    "Description": "A pointer disclosure flaw was found in the SQLite component of the Chromium browser. This flaw basically causes sqlite to leak the underlying memory location, when some operations are performed. This memory-address leak can be used by other (more severe) flaws to potentially result in code-execution.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper handling of pointer values in SQLite, leading to a memory address leak.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
       "Memory Address Leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "The leaked memory address could be used by other vulnerabilities to potentially enable code execution.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when specific operations are performed in SQLite. While the exact attack vector is not detailed, it involves crafted SQL queries or data that interacts with the vulnerable code path.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to execute SQL queries or provide crafted data that triggers the vulnerable code path in SQLite. This could be done through a malicious website or application that uses SQLite."
