Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7697:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `calc_output_single()` function within the `src_sinc.c` file of the libsamplerate library. This occurs during the processing of a crafted audio file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Global buffer over-read in `calc_output_single()`.
- The vulnerability occurs due to the code reading beyond the bounds of the allocated memory for the `slow_mid_qual_coeffs` global variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a crash due to a global buffer over-read, as detected by AddressSanitizer.
- Potential for other consequences such as information disclosure or arbitrary code execution, although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted audio file using the libsamplerate library (e.g., via the `sndfile-resample` tool).
- The attacker needs to provide a specifically crafted audio file that triggers the buffer over-read in the `calc_output_single` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious audio file as input to an application utilizing the vulnerable libsamplerate library. This could be achieved through user interaction, file upload, or any other means where an audio file is processed by the vulnerable library.
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position to trigger this vulnerability.
