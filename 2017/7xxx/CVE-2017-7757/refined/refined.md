  "CVE-2017-7757": {
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in IndexedDB when one of its objects is destroyed in memory while a method on it is still being executed. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when an IndexedDB object is deallocated while a method on it is still being executed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A potentially exploitable crash, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Triggering specific IndexedDB operations in a way that an object is deallocated while still in use."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to find a way to trigger the specific sequence of IndexedDB operations that leads to the use-after-free condition."
