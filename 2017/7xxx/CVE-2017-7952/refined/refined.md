Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `filtervalue` parameter in INFOR EAM V11.0 Build 201410 search fields. Specifically, when the `filteroperator` parameter is set to `IN`, the application does not adequately escape or validate the `filtervalue`, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw. By manipulating the `filtervalue` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full access to the database.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can obtain any available data, even data they are not authorized to access, including sensitive information.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  The attacker can potentially delete or replace existing data within the database.
*   **Credential Theft:**  The attacker can dump the user table, containing usernames and password hashes. This could lead to offline brute-forcing of passwords and subsequent administrative access.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** The attacker can access private files and personal details, such as telephone numbers, physical addresses, and private assets.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Obtaining administrative credentials would grant the attacker the ability to perform administrative actions, such as adding or deleting users and jobs.
*   **Pivoting:**  Access to sensitive information could allow attackers to further compromise other assets.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP POST request targeting a search or filter field within the INFOR EAM application.
*   **`filtervalue` Parameter:** The `filtervalue` parameter in the POST data is the injection point.
*  **`filteroperator` Parameter:** The `filteroperator` needs to be set to `IN` for the `filtervalue` parameter to become vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid EAM Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account within the INFOR EAM application to access the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Proxy Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically achieved using a web proxy.
*   **Understanding of SQL syntax:** The attacker needs to understand SQL to craft the malicious queries.
