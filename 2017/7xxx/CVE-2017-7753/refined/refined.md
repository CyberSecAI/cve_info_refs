Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7753:

**1. Verification:**

*   The official CVE description states: "An out-of-bounds read when applying style rules to pseudo-elements like ::first-line using cached style data."
*   Multiple sources mention this CVE, and the Red Hat Bugzilla entry specifically cites it as "CVE-2017-7753 Mozilla: Out-of-bounds read with cached style data and pseudo-elements (MFSA 2017-19)." The provided content is relevant to CVE-2017-7753.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read that occurs when applying style rules to pseudo-elements (like `::first-line`) using cached style data.
*   Specifically, when a logical property (like `border-inline-start`) that is not supported by a given pseudo-element (like `::first-line`) is used in the CSS, an incorrect style struct can be created. The issue arises because the system attempts to use cached style data and can then read out of bounds due to an incorrect pointer.
*   The Mozilla Security Advisory describes: "An out-of-bounds read occurs when applying style rules to pseudo-elements, such as ::first-line, using cached style data."

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is that the code attempts to read memory outside of allocated bounds due to an incorrect memory address.
*   **Type confusion:**  The system can misinterpret a style unit value for an address in memory.
*   **Improper handling of cached style data:** The vulnerability is triggered due to how cached style data and pseudo-elements are combined

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is a **crash** due to the out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.
*   The vulnerability can also potentially be used to leak memory.
*   The Mozilla Security Advisory suggests with enough effort that some of these issues could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious web page that includes CSS rules targeting pseudo-elements with specific unsupported logical properties which lead to an out-of-bounds read.
*   The use of  `designMode='on'` might be needed in an exploit, as well as the `offsetTop` trigger to cause the crash.
*   The issue is triggered by a specific combination of style settings and is related to how cached style data is used by the CSS engine.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker must be able to get a victim to load the malicious HTML content containing CSS.
*   No special system privileges are required, as the code is executed within the browser's context.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft and provide the HTML content, typically through a website or an email, which is viewed by a victim.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

* The vulnerability stems from incorrect use of cached style data with pseudo-elements. The core issue is that the `nsConditionalResetStyleData` might cache an initial style object with a writing-mode dependency, and then a subsequent style-change in the page can lead to an attempt to use this style data incorrectly.
*   Specific CSS properties such as `border-inline-start` on `::first-line` trigger the bug by introducing a dependency during the rendering process of SVG elements with a filter.
*   The crash occurs in `mozilla::SVGGeometryFrame::GetCanvasTM` function due to a type confusion. The code expects a memory address, but gets a value originating from `nsStyleCorners`. This causes the code to dereference a random value as a pointer and results in an out-of-bounds read.
* The fix involves preventing painting of non-displayable SVG elements, and adding safety checks to prevent usage of invalid pointers.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bug is related to `nsRuleNode` management, how style structs are cached and reused, and when they need to be recomputed.
*   The vulnerability appears when trying to paint an SVG element with a filter.
*   The issue was initially introduced with the changes in [bug 948265](/show_bug.cgi?id=948265 "VERIFIED FIXED - Render CSS Filters using Moz2D"), which is related to CSS filters and their rendering mechanisms, but is exposed because of a fix in [bug 1251797](/show_bug.cgi?id=1251797 "RESOLVED FIXED - only make style data conditional on writing mode when a logical declaration *could* win the cascade").

This analysis gives a good overview of the vulnerability, its causes, and the steps that must be taken to exploit it.
