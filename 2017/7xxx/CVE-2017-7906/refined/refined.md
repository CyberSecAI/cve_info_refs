The provided content is related to CVE-2017-7906.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server of the ABB IP Gateway does not sufficiently verify that a request was performed by the authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352. The web server doesn't properly verify the authenticity of requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can launch requests impersonating an authenticated user. This can lead to unauthorized actions with administrative privileges, potentially causing significant harm to the building management system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack is launched remotely via network.
*   The attacker must trick a user into clicking a malicious link or opening a malicious webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into interacting with a malicious request, typically by using a link or webpage. This means that the attacker is not required to have direct access to the system, only the ability to send malicious requests.
