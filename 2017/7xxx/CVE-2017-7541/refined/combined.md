                 CVE-2017-1000365

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2014-9940

    A use-after-free flaw in the voltage and current regulator driver
    could allow a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially
    escalate privileges.

CVE-2017-7346

    Li Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual GPUs does
    not properly check user-controlled values in the
    vmw_surface_define_ioctl() functions for upper limits. A local user
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-7482

    Shi Lei discovered that RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code does
    not properly verify metadata, leading to information disclosure,
    denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-7533

    Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao discovered a race condition between inotify
    events and VFS rename operations allowing an unprivileged local
    attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

CVE-2017-7541

    A buffer overflow flaw in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n PCIe SoftMAC WLAN
    driver could allow a local user to cause kernel memory corruption,
    leading to a denial of service or potentially privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-7542

    An integer overflow vulnerability in the ip6_find_1stfragopt()
    function was found allowing a local attacker with privileges to open
    raw sockets to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-7889

    Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler reported that the mm subsystem does
    not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection mechanism,
    allowing a local attacker with access to /dev/mem to obtain
    sensitive information or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-9605

    Murray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual
    GPUs does not properly initialize memory, potentially allowing a
    local attacker to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
    kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.

CVE-2017-10911 / XSA-216

    Anthony Perard of Citrix discovered an information leak flaw in Xen
    blkif response handling, allowing a malicious unprivileged guest to
    obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.

CVE-2017-11176

    It was discovered that the mq_notify() function does not set the
    sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. An attacker
    can take advantage of this flaw during a userspace close of a
    Netlink socket to cause a denial of service or potentially cause
    other impact.

CVE-2017-1000363

    Roee Hay reported that the lp driver does not properly bounds-check
    passed arguments, allowing a local attacker with write access to the
    kernel command line arguments to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000365

    It was discovered that argument and environment pointers are not
    taken properly into account to the imposed size restrictions on
    arguments and environmental strings passed through
    RLIMIT_STACK/RLIMIT_INFINITY. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw in conjunction with other flaws to execute arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Message-ID: <2085299843.33841899.1500904419181.JavaMail.zimbra@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 24 Jul 2017 09:53:39 -0400 (EDT)
From: Vladis Dronov <vdronov@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2017-7541: Linux kernel: Memory corruption due to a buffer
 overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx()

Hello,

Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx()
function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to v4.13-rc1. It can be triggered by sending
crafted NL80211_CMD_FRAME packet via netlink.

There was a research if this flaw could be triggered remotely, by sending packets on
the air, the result follows:

RX notification is regarding event send to a userspace program, which is
usually the "wpa_supplicant" or "hostapd". The userspace can register
in kernel via NL80211_CMD_REGISTER_FRAME to pass management frames to it.
This flaw would be remote exploitable if a userspace program registers to
receive some management frames and then pass it back to a kernel without
a modification. I'm not sure if any user space program do that, I think
"hostapd" or "wpa_supplicant" don't, but to be sure, it will require to
fully analyze theirs source code.
(Stanislaw Gruszka <sgruszka@...hat.com>)

So, this flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely, as certain userspace code is needed
for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption
on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation
cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.

commit a8b6fda38f80e75afa3b125c9e7f2550b579454b upstream.
The MSR permission bitmaps are shared by all VMs. However, some VMs
may not be configured to support MPX, even when the host does. If the
host supports VMX and the guest does not, we should intercept accesses
to the BNDCFGS MSR, so that we can synthesize a #GP
fault. Furthermore, if the host does not support MPX and the
"ignore\_msrs" kvm kernel parameter is set, then we should intercept
accesses to the BNDCFGS MSR, so that we can skip over the rdmsr/wrmsr
without raising a #GP fault.

PM / wakeirq: Convert to SRCU
commit ea0212f40c6bc0594c8eff79266759e3ecd4bacc upstream.
The wakeirq infrastructure uses RCU to protect the list of wakeirqs. That
breaks the irq bus locking infrastructure, which is allows sleeping
functions to be called so interrupt controllers behind slow busses,
e.g. i2c, can be handled.
The wakeirq functions hold rcu\_read\_lock and call into irq functions, which
in case of interrupts using the irq bus locking will trigger a
might\_sleep() splat.
Convert the wakeirq infrastructure to Sleepable RCU and unbreak it.

sched/topology: Fix overlapping sched\_group\_mask
commit 73bb059f9b8a00c5e1bf2f7ca83138c05d05e600 upstream.
The point of sched\_group\_mask is to select those CPUs from
sched\_group\_cpus that can actually arrive at this balance domain.
The current code gets it wrong, as can be readily demonstrated with a
topology like:
node 0 1 2 3
0: 10 20 30 20
1: 20 10 20 30
2: 30 20 10 20
3: 20 30 20 10
Where (for example) domain 1 on CPU1 ends up with a mask that includes
CPU0:
[] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
[] domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
[] groups: 1 (mask: 1), 2, 0
[] domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
[] groups: 0-2 (mask: 0-2) (cpu\_capacity: 3072), 0,2-3 (cpu\_capacity: 3072)
This causes sched\_balance\_cpu() to compute the wrong CPU and
consequently should\_we\_balance() will terminate early resulting in
missed load-balance opportunities.
The fixed topology looks like:
[] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
[] domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
[] groups: 1 (mask: 1), 2, 0
[] domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
[] groups: 0-2 (mask: 1) (cpu\_capacity: 3072), 0,2-3 (cpu\_capacity: 3072)
(note: this relies on OVERLAP domains to always have children, this is
true because the regular topology domains are still here -- this is
before degenerate trimming)

sched/topology: Fix building of overlapping sched-groups
commit 0372dd2736e02672ac6e189c31f7d8c02ad543cd upstream.
When building the overlapping groups, we very obviously should start
with the previous domain of \_this\_ @cpu, not CPU-0.
This can be readily demonstrated with a topology like:
node 0 1 2 3
0: 10 20 30 20
1: 20 10 20 30
2: 30 20 10 20
3: 20 30 20 10
Where (for example) CPU1 ends up generating the following nonsensical groups:
[] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
[] domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
[] groups: 1 2 0
[] domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
[] groups: 1-3 (cpu\_capacity = 3072) 0-1,3 (cpu\_capacity = 3072)
Where the fact that domain 1 doesn't include a group with span 0-2 is
the obvious fail.
With patch this looks like:
[] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
[] domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
[] groups: 1 0 2
[] domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
[] groups: 0-2 (cpu\_capacity = 3072) 0,2-3 (cpu\_capacity = 3072)

crypto: caam - fix signals handling
commit 7459e1d25ffefa2b1be799477fcc1f6c62f6cec7 upstream.
Driver does not properly handle the case when signals interrupt
wait\_for\_completion\_interruptible():
-it does not check for return value
-completion structure is allocated on stack; in case a signal interrupts
the sleep, it will go out of scope, causing the worker thread
(caam\_jr\_dequeue) to fail when it accesses it
wait\_for\_completion\_interruptible() is replaced with uninterruptable
wait\_for\_completion().
We choose to block all signals while waiting for I/O (device executing
the split key generation job descriptor) since the alternative - in
order to have a deterministic device state - would be to flush the job
ring (aborting \*all\* in-progress jobs).

crypto: caam - properly set IV after {en,de}crypt
commit 854b06f768794cd664886ec3ba3a5b1c58d42167 upstream.
Certain cipher modes like CTS expect the IV (req->info) of
ablkcipher\_request (or equivalently req->iv of skcipher\_request) to
contain the last ciphertext block when the {en,de}crypt operation is done.
This is currently not the case for the CAAM driver which in turn breaks
e.g. cts(cbc(aes)) when the CAAM driver is enabled.
This patch fixes the CAAM driver to properly set the IV after the
{en,de}crypt operation of ablkcipher finishes.

commit 37511fb5c91db93d8bd6e3f52f86e5a7ff7cfcdf upstream.
JÃ¶rn Engel noticed that the expand\_upwards() function might not return
-ENOMEM in case the requested address is (unsigned long)-PAGE\_SIZE and
if the architecture didn't defined TASK\_SIZE as multiple of PAGE\_SIZE.
Affected architectures are arm, frv, m68k, blackfin, h8300 and xtensa
which all define TASK\_SIZE as 0xffffffff, but since none of those have
an upwards-growing stack we currently have no actual issue.
Nevertheless let's fix this just in case any of the architectures with
an upward-growing stack (currently parisc, metag and partly ia64) define
TASK\_SIZE similar.

selftests/capabilities: Fix the test\_execve test
commit 796a3bae2fba6810427efdb314a1c126c9490fb3 upstream.
test\_execve does rather odd mount manipulations to safely create
temporary setuid and setgid executables that aren't visible to the
rest of the system. Those executables end up in the test's cwd, but
that cwd is MNT\_DETACHed.
The core namespace code considers MNT\_DETACHed trees to belong to no
mount namespace at all and, in general, MNT\_DETACHed trees are only
barely function. This interacted with commit 380cf5ba6b0a ("fs:
Treat foreign mounts as nosuid") to cause all MNT\_DETACHed trees to
act as though they're nosuid, breaking the test.
Fix it by just not detaching the tree. It's still in a private
mount namespace and is therefore still invisible to the rest of the
system (except via /proc, and the same nosuid logic will protect all
other programs on the system from believing in test\_execve's setuid
bits).
While we're at it, fix some blatant whitespace problems.

mnt: Make propagate\_umount less slow for overlapping mount propagation trees
commit 296990deb389c7da21c78030376ba244dc1badf5 upstream.
Andrei Vagin pointed out that time to executue propagate\_umount can go
non-linear (and take a ludicrious amount of time) when the mount
propogation trees of the mounts to be unmunted by a lazy unmount
overlap.
Make the walk of the mount propagation trees nearly linear by
remembering which mounts have already been visited, allowing
subsequent walks to detect when walking a mount propgation tree or a
subtree of a mount propgation tree would be duplicate work and to skip
them entirely.
Walk the list of mounts whose propgatation trees need to be traversed
from the mount highest in the mount tree to mounts lower in the mount
tree so that odds are higher that the code will walk the largest trees
first, allowing later tree walks to be skipped entirely.
Add cleanup\_umount\_visitation to remover the code's memory of which
mounts have been visited.
Add the functions last\_slave and skip\_propagation\_subtree to allow
skipping appropriate parts of the mount propagation tree without
needing to change the logic of the rest of the code.
A script to generate overlapping mount propagation trees:
$ cat runs.h
set -e
mount -t tmpfs zdtm /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/1 /mnt/2
mount -t tmpfs zdtm /mnt/1
mount --make-shared /mnt/1
mkdir /mnt/1/1
iteration=10
if [ -n "$1" ] ; then
iteration=$1
fi
for i in $(seq $iteration); do
mount --bind /mnt/1/1 /mnt/1/1
done
mount --rbind /mnt/1 /mnt/2
TIMEFORMAT='%Rs'
nr=$(( ( 2 \*\* ( $iteration + 1 ) ) + 1 ))
echo -n "umount -l /mnt/1 -> $nr "
time umount -l /mnt/1
nr=$(cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep zdtm | wc -l )

mnt: In propgate\_umount handle visiting mounts in any order
commit 99b19d16471e9c3faa85cad38abc9cbbe04c6d55 upstream.
While investigating some poor umount performance I realized that in
the case of overlapping mount trees where some of the mounts are locked
the code has been failing to unmount all of the mounts it should
have been unmounting.
This failure to unmount all of the necessary
mounts can be reproduced with:
$ cat locked\_mounts\_test.sh
mount -t tmpfs test-base /mnt
mount --make-shared /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/b
mount -t tmpfs test1 /mnt/b
mount --make-shared /mnt/b
mkdir -p /mnt/b/10
mount -t tmpfs test2 /mnt/b/10
mount --make-shared /mnt/b/10
mkdir -p /mnt/b/10/20
mount --rbind /mnt/b /mnt/b/10/20
unshare -Urm --propagation unchaged /bin/sh -c 'sleep 5; if [ $(grep test /proc/self/mountinfo | wc -l) -eq 1 ] ; then echo SUCCESS ; else echo FAILURE ; fi'
sleep 1
umount -l /mnt/b
wait %%
$ unshare -Urm ./locked\_mounts\_test.sh
This failure is corrected by removing the prepass that marks mounts
that may be umounted.
A first pass is added that umounts mounts if possible and if not sets
mount mark if they could be unmounted if they weren't locked and adds
them to a list to umount possibilities. This first pass reconsiders
the mounts parent if it is on the list of umount possibilities, ensuring
that information of umoutability will pass from child to mount parent.
A second pass then walks through all mounts that are umounted and processes
their children unmounting them or marking them for reparenting.
A last pass cleans up the state on the mounts that could not be umounted
and if applicable reparents them to their first parent that remained
mounted.
While a bit longer than the old code this code is much more robust
as it allows information to flow up from the leaves and down

mnt: In umount propagation reparent in a separate pass
commit 570487d3faf2a1d8a220e6ee10f472163123d7da upstream.
It was observed that in some pathlogical cases that the current code
does not unmount everything it should. After investigation it
was determined that the issue is that mnt\_change\_mntpoint can
can change which mounts are available to be unmounted during mount
propagation which is wrong.
The trivial reproducer is:
$ cat ./pathological.sh
mount -t tmpfs test-base /mnt
cd /mnt
mkdir 1 2 1/1
mount --bind 1 1
mount --make-shared 1
mount --bind 1 2
mount --bind 1/1 1/1
mount --bind 1/1 1/1
echo
grep test-base /proc/self/mountinfo
umount 1/1
echo
grep test-base /proc/self/mountinfo
$ unshare -Urm ./pathological.sh
The expected output looks like:
46 31 0:25 / /mnt rw,relatime - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000
47 46 0:25 /1 /mnt/1 rw,relatime shared:1 - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000
48 46 0:25 /1 /mnt/2 rw,relatime shared:1 - tmpfs test-base rw,uid=1000,gid=1000

That last mount in the output was in the propgation tree to be unmounted but
was missed because the mnt\_change\_mountpoint changed it's parent before the walk
through the mount propagation tree observed it.

the same manual checks for VERIFY\_READ vs VERIFY\_WRITE, relying on the MMU

again on some odd arch in the future.

arm64: Preventing READ\_IMPLIES\_EXEC propagation
commit 48f99c8ec0b25756d0283ab058826ae07d14fad7 upstream.
Like arch/arm/, we inherit the READ\_IMPLIES\_EXEC personality flag across
fork(). This is undesirable for a number of reasons:
\* ELF files that don't require executable stack can end up with it
anyway
\* We end up performing un-necessary I-cache maintenance when mapping
what should be non-executable pages
\* Restricting what is executable is generally desirable when defending
against overflow attacks
This patch clears the personality flag when setting up the personality for
newly spwaned native tasks. Given that semi-recent AArch64 toolchains emit
a non-executable PT\_GNU\_STACK header, userspace applications can already
not rely on READ\_IMPLIES\_EXEC so shouldn't be adversely affected by this
change.

powerpc/kexec: Fix radix to hash kexec due to IAMR/AMOR
commit 1e2a516e89fc412a754327522ab271b42f99c6b4 upstream.
This patch fixes a crash seen while doing a kexec from radix mode to
hash mode. Key 0 is special in hash and used in the RPN by default, we
set the key values to 0 today. In radix mode key 0 is used to control
supervisor<->user access. In hash key 0 is used by default, so the
first instruction after the switch causes a crash on kexec.
Commit 3b10d0095a1e ("powerpc/mm/radix: Prevent kernel execution of
user space") introduced the setting of IAMR and AMOR values to prevent
execution of user mode instructions from supervisor mode. We need to
clean up these SPR's on kexec.

s390: reduce ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE

Now that explicitly executed loaders are loaded in the mmap region, we

address space to avoid possible collisions with mmap or stack regions.
For 64-bit, align to 4GB to allow runtimes to use the entire 32-bit
address space for 32-bit pointers. On 32-bit use 4MB, which is the
traditional x86 minimum load location, likely to avoid historically
requiring a 4MB page table entry when only a portion of the first 4MB
would be used (since the NULL address is avoided). For s390 the
position could be 0x10000, but that is needlessly close to the NULL
address.

binfmt\_elf: use ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE only for PIE
commit eab09532d40090698b05a07c1c87f39fdbc5fab5 upstream.
The ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE position was originally intended to keep loaders
away from ET\_EXEC binaries. (For example, running "/lib/ld-linux.so.2
/bin/cat" might cause the subsequent load of /bin/cat into where the
loader had been loaded.)
With the advent of PIE (ET\_DYN binaries with an INTERP Program Header),
ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE continued to be used since the kernel was only looking
at ET\_DYN. However, since ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE is traditionally set at the
top 1/3rd of the TASK\_SIZE, a substantial portion of the address space
is unused.
For 32-bit tasks when RLIMIT\_STACK is set to RLIM\_INFINITY, programs are
loaded above the mmap region. This means they can be made to collide
(CVE-2017-1000370) or nearly collide (CVE-2017-1000371) with
pathological stack regions.
Lowering ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE solves both by moving programs below the mmap
region in all cases, and will now additionally avoid programs falling
back to the mmap region by enforcing MAP\_FIXED for program loads (i.e.
if it would have collided with the stack, now it will fail to load
instead of falling back to the mmap region).
To allow for a lower ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE, loaders (ET\_DYN without INTERP)
are loaded into the mmap region, leaving space available for either an
ET\_EXEC binary with a fixed location or PIE being loaded into mmap by
the loader. Only PIE programs are loaded offset from ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE,
which means architectures can now safely lower their values without risk
of loaders colliding with their subsequently loaded programs.
For 64-bit, ELF\_ET\_DYN\_BASE is best set to 4GB to allow runtimes to use
the entire 32-bit address space for 32-bit pointers.
Thanks to PaX Team, Daniel Micay, and Rik van Riel for inspiration and
suggestions on how to implement this solution.

fs/dcache.c: fix spin lockup issue on nlru->lock
commit b17c070fb624cf10162cf92ea5e1ec25cd8ac176 upstream.
\_\_list\_lru\_walk\_one() acquires nlru spin lock (nlru->lock) for longer
duration if there are more number of items in the lru list. As per the
current code, it can hold the spin lock for upto maximum UINT\_MAX
entries at a time. So if there are more number of items in the lru
list, then "BUG: spinlock lockup suspected" is observed in the below
path:
spin\_bug+0x90
do\_raw\_spin\_lock+0xfc
\_raw\_spin\_lock+0x28
list\_lru\_add+0x28
dput+0x1c8
path\_put+0x20

path\_lookupat+0x100
filename\_lookup+0x6c
user\_path\_at\_empty+0x54
SyS\_faccessat+0xd0
el0\_svc\_naked+0x24
This nlru->lock is acquired by another CPU in this path -
d\_lru\_shrink\_move+0x34
dentry\_lru\_isolate\_shrink+0x48
\_\_list\_lru\_walk\_one.isra.10+0x94
list\_lru\_walk\_node+0x40

do\_emergency\_remount+0xb0
process\_one\_work+0x228
worker\_thread+0x2e0
kthread+0xf4
ret\_from\_fork+0x10
Fix this lockup by reducing the number of entries to be shrinked from
the lru list to 1024 at once. Also, add cond\_resched() before
processing the lru list again.

mm/list\_lru.c: fix list\_lru\_count\_node() to be race free
commit 2c80cd57c74339889a8752b20862a16c28929c3a upstream.
list\_lru\_count\_node() iterates over all memcgs to get the total number of
entries on the node but it can race with memcg\_drain\_all\_list\_lrus(),
which migrates the entries from a dead cgroup to another. This can return
incorrect number of entries from list\_lru\_count\_node().
Fix this by keeping track of entries per node and simply return it in
list\_lru\_count\_node().

kernel/extable.c: mark core\_kernel\_text notrace
commit c0d80ddab89916273cb97114889d3f337bc370ae upstream.
core\_kernel\_text is used by MIPS in its function graph trace processing,
so having this method traced leads to an infinite set of recursive calls
such as:

compiler, clang: always inline when CONFIG\_OPTIMIZE\_INLINING is disabled
commit 9a04dbcfb33b4012d0ce8c0282f1e3ca694675b1 upstream.
The motivation for commit abb2ea7dfd82 ("compiler, clang: suppress
warning for unused static inline functions") was to suppress clang's
warnings about unused static inline functions.
For configs without CONFIG\_OPTIMIZE\_INLINING enabled, such as any non-x86
architecture, `inline' in the kernel implies that
\_\_attribute\_\_((always\_inline)) is used.
Some code depends on that behavior, see
https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/6/13/918:
net/built-in.o: In function `\_\_xchg\_mb':
arch/arm64/include/asm/cmpxchg.h:99: undefined reference to `\_\_compiletime\_assert\_99'
arch/arm64/include/asm/cmpxchg.h:99: undefined reference to `\_\_compiletime\_assert\_99
The full fix would be to identify these breakages and annotate the
functions with \_\_always\_inline instead of `inline'. But since we are
late in the 4.12-rc cycle, simply carry forward the forced inlining
behavior and work toward moving arm64, and other architectures, toward
CONFIG\_OPTIMIZE\_INLINING behavior.

tools/lib/lockdep: Reduce MAX\_LOCK\_DEPTH to avoid overflowing lock\_chain/: Depth
commit 98dcea0cfd04e083ac74137ceb9a632604740e2d upstream.
liblockdep has been broken since commit 75dd602a5198 ("lockdep: Fix
lock\_chain::base size"), as that adds a check that MAX\_LOCK\_DEPTH is
within the range of lock\_chain::depth and in liblockdep it is much
too large.
That should have resulted in a compiler error, but didn't because:
- the check uses ARRAY\_SIZE(), which isn't yet defined in liblockdep
so is assumed to be an (undeclared) function
- putting a function call inside a BUILD\_BUG\_ON() expression quietly
turns it into some nonsense involving a variable-length array
It did produce a compiler warning, but I didn't notice because
liblockdep already produces too many warnings if -Wall is enabled
(which I'll fix shortly).
Even before that commit, which reduced lock\_chain::depth from 8 bits
to 6, MAX\_LOCK\_DEPTH was too large.

parisc/mm: Ensure IRQs are off in switch\_mm()
commit 649aa24254e85bf6bd7807dd372d083707852b1f upstream.
This is because of commit f98db6013c55 ("sched/core: Add switch\_mm\_irqs\_off()
and use it in the scheduler") in which switch\_mm\_irqs\_off() is called by the
scheduler, vs switch\_mm() which is used by use\_mm().
This patch lets the parisc code mirror the x86 and powerpc code, ie. it
disables interrupts in switch\_mm(), and optimises the scheduler case by
defining switch\_mm\_irqs\_off().

parisc: Report SIGSEGV instead of SIGBUS when running out of stack
commit 247462316f85a9e0479445c1a4223950b68ffac1 upstream.
When a process runs out of stack the parisc kernel wrongly faults with SIGBUS
instead of the expected SIGSEGV signal.
This example shows how the kernel faults:
do\_page\_fault() command='a.out' type=15 address=0xfaac2000 in libc-2.24.so[f8308000+16c000]
trap #15: Data TLB miss fault, vm\_start = 0xfa2c2000, vm\_end = 0xfaac2000
The vma->vm\_end value is the first address which does not belong to the vma, so
adjust the check to include vma->vm\_end to the range for which to send the
SIGSEGV signal.
This patch unbreaks building the debian libsigsegv package.

KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix typo in XICS-on-XIVE state saving code
commit 00c14757f6abacd78cad9b2690a0e1f42e4b76c8 upstream.
This fixes a typo where the wrong loop index was used to index
the kvmppc\_xive\_vcpu.queues[] array in xive\_pre\_save\_scan().
The variable i contains the vcpu number; we need to index queues[]
using j, which iterates from 0 to KVMPPC\_XIVE\_Q\_COUNT-1.
The effect of this bug is that things that save the interrupt
controller state, such as "virsh dump", on a VM with more than
8 vCPUs, result in xive\_pre\_save\_queue() getting called on a
bogus queue structure, usually resulting in a crash like this:

KVM: ARM64: fix phy counter access failure in guest.
commit 02d50cdaff36c135d222015cffdca3ff11d168ea upstream.
When reading the cntpct\_el0 in guest with VHE (Virtual Host Extension)
enabled in host, the "Unsupported guest sys\_reg access" error reported.
The reason is cnthctl\_el2.EL1PCTEN is not enabled, which is expected
to be done in kvm\_timer\_init\_vhe(). The problem is kvm\_timer\_init\_vhe
is called by cpu\_init\_hyp\_mode, and which is called when VHE is disabled.
This patch remove the incorrect call to kvm\_timer\_init\_vhe() from
cpu\_init\_hyp\_mode(), and calls kvm\_timer\_init\_vhe() to enable
cnthctl\_el2.EL1PCTEN in cpu\_hyp\_reinit().

commit 5ea59db8a375216e6c915c5586f556766673b5a7 upstream.
An earlier change to this function (3bdae810721b) fixed a leak in the
case of an unsuccessful call to brcmf\_sdiod\_buffrw(). However, the
glom\_skb buffer, used for emulating a scattering read, is never used
or referenced after its contents are copied into the destination
buffers, and therefore always needs to be freed by the end of the
function.

[ Upstream commit c70d68150f71b84cea6997a53493e17bf18a54db ]
If we have more than 32 unicast MAC addresses assigned to an interface
we will read beyond the end of the address table in the driver when
adding filters. The next 256 entries store multicast addresses, so we
will end up attempting to insert duplicate filters, which is mostly
harmless. If we add more than 288 unicast addresses we will then read
past the multicast address table, which is likely to be more exciting.

cxgb4: fix BUG() on interrupt deallocating path of ULD

Since the introduction of ULD (Upper-Layer Drivers), the MSI-X
deallocating path changed in cxgb4: the driver frees the interrupts
of ULD when unregistering it or on shutdown PCI handler.
Problem is that if a MSI-X is not freed before deallocated in the PCI
layer, it will trigger a BUG() due to still "alive" interrupt being
tentatively quiesced.
The below trace was observed when doing a simple unbind of Chelsio's
adapter PCI function, like:
"echo 001e:80:00.4 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/cxgb4/unbind"

net/mlx5e: Initialize CEE's getpermhwaddr address buffer to 0xff
[ Upstream commit d968f0f2e4404152f37ed2384b4a2269dd2dae5a ]
Latest change in open-lldp code uses bytes 6-11 of perm\_addr buffer
as the Ethernet source address for the host TLV packet.
Since our driver does not fill these bytes, they stay at zero and
the open-lldp code ends up sending the TLV packet with zero source
address and the switch drops this packet.
The fix is to initialize these bytes to 0xff. The open-lldp code
considers 0xff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff as the invalid address and falls back to
use the host's mac address as the Ethernet source address.

rds: tcp: use sock\_create\_lite() to create the accept socket
[ Upstream commit 0933a578cd55b02dc80f219dc8f2efb17ec61c9a ]
There are two problems with calling sock\_create\_kern() from
rds\_tcp\_accept\_one()
1. it sets up a new\_sock->sk that is wasteful, because this ->sk
is going to get replaced by inet\_accept() in the subsequent ->accept()
2. The new\_sock->sk is a leaked reference in sock\_graft() which
expects to find a null parent->sk
Avoid these problems by calling sock\_create\_lite().

vrf: fix bug\_on triggered by rx when destroying a vrf
[ Upstream commit f630c38ef0d785101363a8992bbd4f302180f86f ]
When destroying a VRF device we cleanup the slaves in its ndo\_uninit()
function, but that causes packets to be switched (skb->dev == vrf being
destroyed) even though we're pass the point where the VRF should be
receiving any packets while it is being dismantled. This causes a BUG\_ON
to trigger if we have raw sockets (trace below).
The reason is that the inetdev of the VRF has been destroyed but we're
still sending packets up the stack with it, so let's free the slaves in
the dellink callback as David Ahern suggested.
Note that this fix doesn't prevent packets from going up when the VRF
device is admin down.

liquidio: fix bug in soft reset failure detection
[ Upstream commit 05a6b4cae8c0cc1680c9dd33a97a49a13c0f01bc ]
The code that detects a failed soft reset of Octeon is comparing the wrong
value against the reset value of the Octeon SLI\_SCRATCH\_1 register,
resulting in an inability to detect a soft reset failure. Fix it by using
the correct value in the comparison, which is any non-zero value.

vxlan: fix hlist corruption
[ Upstream commit 69e766612c4bcb79e19cebed9eed61d4222c1d47 ]
It's not a good idea to add the same hlist\_node to two different hash lists.
This leads to various hard to debug memory corruptions.

ipv6: dad: don't remove dynamic addresses if link is down
[ Upstream commit ec8add2a4c9df723c94a863b8fcd6d93c472deed ]
Currently, when the link for $DEV is down, this command succeeds but the
address is removed immediately by DAD (1):
ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid\_lft 3600 preferred\_lft 1800
In the same situation, this will succeed and not remove the address (2):
ip addr add 1111::12/64 dev $DEV
ip addr change 1111::12/64 dev $DEV valid\_lft 3600 preferred\_lft 1800
The comment in addrconf\_dad\_begin() when !IF\_READY makes it look like
this is the intended behavior, but doesn't explain why:
\* If the device is not ready:
\* - keep it tentative if it is a permanent address.
\* - otherwise, kill it.
We clearly cannot prevent userspace from doing (2), but we can make (1)
work consistently with (2).
addrconf\_dad\_stop() is only called in two cases: if DAD failed, or to
skip DAD when the link is down. In that second case, the fix is to avoid
deleting the address, like we already do for permanent addresses.

Subject: brcmfmac: fix possible buffer overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx()

From: Arend van Spriel <arend.vanspriel@xxxxxxxxxxxx>

[ Upstream commit 8f44c9a41386729fea410e688959ddaa9d51be7c ]

The lower level nl80211 code in cfg80211 ensures that "len" is between
25 and NL80211_ATTR_FRAME (2304).  We subtract DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN (24) from
"len" so thats's max of 2280.  However, the action_frame->data[] buffer is
only BRCMF_FIL_ACTION_FRAME_SIZE (1800) bytes long so this memcpy() can
overflow.

	memcpy(action_frame->data, &buf[DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN],
	       le16_to_cpu(action_frame->len));

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2930)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Out-of-bounds kernel heap access vulnerability was found in xfrm, kernel's IP framework for transforming packets. An error dealing with netlink messages from an unprivileged user leads to arbitrary read/write and privilege escalation. (CVE-2017-7184, Important)
* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets are implemented in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handling synchronization. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2017-1000111, Important)
* An exploitable memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The append path can be erroneously switched from UFO to non-UFO in ip\_ufo\_append\_data() when building an UFO packet with MSG\_MORE option. If unprivileged user namespaces are available, this flaw can be exploited to gain root privileges. (CVE-2017-1000112, Important)
* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)
* Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in brcmf\_cfg80211\_mgmt\_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to v4.13-rc1. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted NL80211\_CMD\_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is unlikely. (CVE-2017-7541, Moderate)
* An integer overflow vulnerability in ip6\_find\_1stfragopt() function was found. A local attacker that has privileges (of CAP\_NET\_RAW) to open raw socket can cause an infinite loop inside the ip6\_find\_1stfragopt() function. (CVE-2017-7542, Moderate)
* A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux kernel in inet\_diag\_msg\_sctp{,l}addr\_fill() and sctp\_get\_sctp\_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace. (CVE-2017-7558, Moderate)
* The mq\_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to possibly cause a situation where a value may be used after being freed (use-after-free) which may lead to memory corruption or other unspecified other impact. (CVE-2017-11176, Moderate)
* A divide-by-zero vulnerability was found in the \_\_tcp\_select\_window function in the Linux kernel. This can result in a kernel panic causing a local denial of service. (CVE-2017-14106, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Chaitin Security Research Lab for reporting CVE-2017-7184; Willem de Bruijn for reporting CVE-2017-1000111; and Andrey Konovalov for reporting CVE-2017-1000112. The CVE-2017-7558 issue was discovered by Stefano Brivio (Red Hat).

Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements included in this advisory. To see the complete list of bug fixes and enhancements, refer to the following KnowledgeBase article: <https://access.redhat.com/node/3212921.>

## Solution

# Android Security Bulletin—November 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published November 6, 2017 | Updated November 8, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2017-11-06 or later address
all of these issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check and update
your Android version](//support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705).

Android partners were notified of all issues in the 2017-11-01 and 2017-11-05
patch levels at least a month before publication. Android partners were notified
of all issues in the 2017-11-06 patch level within the last month. Source code
patches for these issues have been released to the Android Open Source Project
(AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin also includes
links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in Media
framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to
execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google Play
Protect mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and Google Play Protect, which improve the
security of the Android platform.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air update (OTA) and
firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[November 2017
Pixel / Nexus Security Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2017-11-01).

## Announcements

* We have launched a new
  [Pixel / Nexus Security
  Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel), which contains information on additional security
  vulnerabilities and functional improvements that are addressed on supported
  Pixel and Nexus devices. Android device manufacturers may choose to address
  these issues on their devices. See [Common questions and
  answers](#questions) for additional information.
* Security patches for the KRACK vulnerabilities are provided under the
  2017-11-06 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [Google Play Protect](//www.android.com/play-protect). These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through [Google Play Protect](//www.android.com/play-protect) and warns
  users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile Services](//www.android.com/gms), and is
  especially important for users who install apps from outside of Google
  Play.

chipset manufacturers where applicable.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see [Check
& update your Android version](//support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-11-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-11-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-11-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-11-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.
* Security patch levels of 2017-11-06 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-11-06 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-11-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-11-05]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-11-06]

**2. Why does this bulletin have three security patch levels?**

This bulletin has three security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2017-11-01 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues
  reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the 2017-11-05 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, the 2017-11-01 security patch level,
  as well as fixes for all issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2017-11-06 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer
site](//developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device/partner security bulletins, such as the Pixel / Nexus bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android devices.
Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in the device/partner
security bulletins are not required for declaring a security patch level.
Android device and chipset manufacturers are encouraged to document the presence
of other fixes on their devices through their own security websites, such as the
[Samsung](//security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb), [LGE](//lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates.html), or [Pixel / Nexus](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel) security bulletins.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2918)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* Out-of-bounds kernel heap access vulnerability was found in xfrm, kernel's IP framework for transforming packets. An error dealing with netlink messages from an unprivileged user leads to arbitrary read/write and privilege escalation. (CVE-2017-7184, Important)
* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets are implemented in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handling synchronization. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2017-1000111, Important)
* An exploitable memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The append path can be erroneously switched from UFO to non-UFO in ip\_ufo\_append\_data() when building an UFO packet with MSG\_MORE option. If unprivileged user namespaces are available, this flaw can be exploited to gain root privileges. (CVE-2017-1000112, Important)
* Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in brcmf\_cfg80211\_mgmt\_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to v4.13-rc1. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted NL80211\_CMD\_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is unlikely. (CVE-2017-7541, Moderate)
* An integer overflow vulnerability in ip6\_find\_1stfragopt() function was found. A local attacker that has privileges (of CAP\_NET\_RAW) to open raw socket can cause an infinite loop inside the ip6\_find\_1stfragopt() function. (CVE-2017-7542, Moderate)
* A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux kernel in inet\_diag\_msg\_sctp{,l}addr\_fill() and sctp\_get\_sctp\_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace. (CVE-2017-7558, Moderate)
* The mq\_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to possibly cause a situation where a value may be used after being freed (use-after-free) which may lead to memory corruption or other unspecified other impact. (CVE-2017-11176, Moderate)
* A divide-by-zero vulnerability was found in the \_\_tcp\_select\_window function in the Linux kernel. This can result in a kernel panic causing a local denial of service. (CVE-2017-14106, Moderate)
* A flaw was found where the XFS filesystem code mishandles a user-settable inode flag in the Linux kernel prior to 4.14-rc1. This can cause a local denial of service via a kernel panic. (CVE-2017-14340, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Chaitin Security Research Lab for reporting CVE-2017-7184; Willem de Bruijn for reporting CVE-2017-1000111; and Andrey Konovalov for reporting CVE-2017-1000112. The CVE-2017-7558 issue was discovered by Stefano Brivio (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-14340 issue was discovered by Dave Chinner (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-693.5.2 source tree, which provides number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1489085)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2931)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* Out-of-bounds kernel heap access vulnerability was found in xfrm, kernel's IP framework for transforming packets. An error dealing with netlink messages from an unprivileged user leads to arbitrary read/write and privilege escalation. (CVE-2017-7184, Important)
* A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way the raw packet sockets are implemented in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handling synchronization. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2017-1000111, Important)
* An exploitable memory corruption flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The append path can be erroneously switched from UFO to non-UFO in ip\_ufo\_append\_data() when building an UFO packet with MSG\_MORE option. If unprivileged user namespaces are available, this flaw can be exploited to gain root privileges. (CVE-2017-1000112, Important)
* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)
* Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in brcmf\_cfg80211\_mgmt\_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to v4.13-rc1. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted NL80211\_CMD\_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is unlikely. (CVE-2017-7541, Moderate)
* An integer overflow vulnerability in ip6\_find\_1stfragopt() function was found. A local attacker that has privileges (of CAP\_NET\_RAW) to open raw socket can cause an infinite loop inside the ip6\_find\_1stfragopt() function. (CVE-2017-7542, Moderate)
* A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux kernel in inet\_diag\_msg\_sctp{,l}addr\_fill() and sctp\_get\_sctp\_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace. (CVE-2017-7558, Moderate)
* The mq\_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to possibly cause a situation where a value may be used after being freed (use-after-free) which may lead to memory corruption or other unspecified other impact. (CVE-2017-11176, Moderate)
* A divide-by-zero vulnerability was found in the \_\_tcp\_select\_window function in the Linux kernel. This can result in a kernel panic causing a local denial of service. (CVE-2017-14106, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Chaitin Security Research Lab for reporting CVE-2017-7184; Willem de Bruijn for reporting CVE-2017-1000111; and Andrey Konovalov for reporting CVE-2017-1000112. The CVE-2017-7558 issue was discovered by Stefano Brivio (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-693.5.2 source tree, which provides number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1489084)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1473198#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-20 08:26:38 UTC  ``` Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to v4.13-rc1. It can be triggered by sending crafted NL80211_CMD_FRAME packet via netlink.  This flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely, as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.

brcmfmac: fix possible buffer overflow in brcmf\_cfg80211\_mgmt\_tx()

```
The lower level nl80211 code in cfg80211 ensures that "len" is between
25 and NL80211_ATTR_FRAME (2304).  We subtract DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN (24) from
"len" so thats's max of 2280.  However, the action_frame->data[] buffer is
only BRCMF_FIL_ACTION_FRAME_SIZE (1800) bytes long so this memcpy() can
overflow.

	memcpy(action_frame->data, &buf[DOT11_MGMT_HDR_LEN],
	       le16_to_cpu(action_frame->len));

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1470659#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-13 12:13:50 UTC  ``` The mq_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to possibly cause a situation where a value may be used after being freed (Use after free) which may lead to memory corruption or other unspecified other impact.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f991af3daabaecff34684fd51fac80319d1baad1>  Mitre advisory: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11176>  What is use after free: <https://access.redhat.com/use-after-free-flaw-type>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1470659#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-13 12:14:42 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1470660](show_bug.cgi?id=1470660 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-11176 kernel: Use-after-free in sys_mq_notify() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1470659#c2)  Fedora Update System    2017-07-23 22:55:03 UTC  ``` kernel-4.11.11-200.fc25 has been pushed to the Fedora 25 stable repository.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2863)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Kernel memory corruption due to a buffer overflow was found in brcmf\_cfg80211\_mgmt\_tx() function in Linux kernels from v3.9-rc1 to v4.13-rc1. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted NL80211\_CMD\_FRAME packet via netlink. This flaw is unlikely to be triggered remotely as certain userspace code is needed for this. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is unlikely. (CVE-2017-7541, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, removal of a rport during ISCSI target scanning could cause a kernel panic. This was happening because addition of STARGET\_REMOVE to the rport state introduced a race condition to the SCSI code. This update adds the STARGET\_CREATED\_REMOVE state as a possible state of the rport and appropriate handling of that state, thus fixing the bug. As a result, the kernel panic no longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1472127)
* Previously, GFS2 contained multiple bugs where the wrong inode was assigned to GFS2 cluster-wide locks (glocks), or the assigned inode was cleared incorrectly. Consequently, kernel panic could occur when using GFS2. With this update, GFS2 has been fixed, and the kernel no longer panics due to those bugs. (BZ#1479397)
* Previously, VMs with memory larger than 64GB running on Hyper-V with Windows Server hosts reported potential memory size of 4TB and more, but could not use more than 64GB. This was happening because the Memory Type Range Register (MTRR) for memory above 64GB was omitted. With this update, the /proc/mtrr file has been fixed to show correct base/size if they are more than 44 bit wide. As a result, the whole size of memory is now available as expected under the described circumstances. (BZ#1482855)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

brcmfmac: fix possible buffer overflow in brcmf\_cfg80211\_mgmt\_tx()The lower level nl80211 code in cfg80211 ensures that "len" is between
25 and NL80211\_ATTR\_FRAME (2304). We subtract DOT11\_MGMT\_HDR\_LEN (24) from
"len" so thats's max of 2280. However, the action\_frame->data[] buffer is
only BRCMF\_FIL\_ACTION\_FRAME\_SIZE (1800) bytes long so this memcpy() can
overflow.
memcpy(action\_frame->data, &buf[DOT11\_MGMT\_HDR\_LEN],
le16\_to\_cpu(action\_frame->len));

                 CVE-2017-11176 CVE-2017-1000365

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-7346

    Li Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual GPUs does
    not properly check user-controlled values in the
    vmw_surface_define_ioctl() functions for upper limits. A local user
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-7482

    Shi Lei discovered that RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code does
    not properly verify metadata, leading to information disclosure,
    denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-7533

    Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao discovered a race condition between inotify
    events and VFS rename operations allowing an unprivileged local
    attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

CVE-2017-7541

    A buffer overflow flaw in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n PCIe SoftMAC WLAN
    driver could allow a local user to cause kernel memory corruption,
    leading to a denial of service or potentially privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-7542

    An integer overflow vulnerability in the ip6_find_1stfragopt()
    function was found allowing a local attacker with privileges to open
    raw sockets to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-9605

    Murray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual
    GPUs does not properly initialize memory, potentially allowing a
    local attacker to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
    kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.

CVE-2017-10810

    Li Qiang discovered a memory leak flaw within the VirtIO GPU driver
    resulting in denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2017-10911 / XSA-216

    Anthony Perard of Citrix discovered an information leak flaw in Xen
    blkif response handling, allowing a malicious unprivileged guest to
    obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.

CVE-2017-11176

    It was discovered that the mq_notify() function does not set the
    sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. An attacker
    can take advantage of this flaw during a user-space close of a
    Netlink socket to cause a denial of service or potentially cause
    other impact.

CVE-2017-1000365

    It was discovered that argument and environment pointers are not
    taken properly into account to the imposed size restrictions on
    arguments and environmental strings passed through
    RLIMIT_STACK/RLIMIT_INFINITY. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw in conjunction with other flaws to execute arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed in
a subsequent DSA.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
