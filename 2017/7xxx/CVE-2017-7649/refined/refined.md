Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the Eclipse Kura installer's network management configuration. It disables the host system's firewall and takes over its management. However, it only configures firewall rules for IPv4 and not IPv6. IPv6 is left in auto-configuration mode, accepting router advertisements automatically and assigning a MAC address based IPv6 address. This leaves the Equinox console port (5002) exposed without firewall protection under IPv6.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incomplete Firewall Configuration:** The installer does not set up firewall rules for IPv6, leaving the system vulnerable through this protocol.
*   **Exposed Equinox Console:** Port 5002, used by the Equinox console, is left open and accessible without any authentication via unencrypted telnet.
*   **Unencrypted Telnet Access:** The Equinox console allows unencrypted telnet access, exposing the system to eavesdropping and replay attacks.
*   **Lack of User Credentials:** The console can be accessed without requiring user credentials.
*   **Root Privileges:** The Kura process runs as root which allows an attacker to gain full control over the device when exploiting the console access.
*   **Predictable IPv6 Address:** The IPv6 address can be "guessed" by knowing the MAC address of the network port, simplifying network scanning and discovery for attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain:
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands through the Equinox console.
*   **Full Control over Device:** Since the Kura process runs with root privileges, the attacker gains full control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, leveraging IPv6 connectivity.
*   **Telnet Protocol:** The attacker connects to the exposed port (5002) using the telnet protocol.
*   **Equinox Console:** The attacker utilizes the Equinox console to execute commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*   **IPv6 Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the device using IPv6.
*   **Knowledge of MAC address:** Knowing the MAC address of the vulnerable device's network interface is helpful in deducing the device's IPv6 address.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Kura version 2.1.0.
*   The issue affects the Kura installer (deb, sh or rpm files), not the Kura artifacts.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is calculated to be 9.2.
*   The vulnerability affects network enabled distributions where Kura takes over management of the firewall. Distributions that do not change the firewall configuration (NN distributions) are not vulnerable.
