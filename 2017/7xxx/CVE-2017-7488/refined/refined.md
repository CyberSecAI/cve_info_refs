{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The authconfig utility could generate a PAM configuration where the system would handle existing and non-existing logins differently when SSSD is used for authentication against a remote server. This different handling leaked information about the existence of a user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Leak. The system's response time and behavior during login attempts differed depending on whether the user account existed, allowing an attacker to enumerate valid user accounts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with physical or network access to the machine could enumerate users via a timing attack.",
  "Attack vectors": "Physical or network access to the target machine.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires either physical access or network access to the machine that's configured to use SSSD with the vulnerable PAM configuration.",
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was caused by an incorrect PAM configuration generated by authconfig. The fix involves modifying the PAM configuration to skip pam_unix only for known non-local users who are not system users. The fix was implemented in authconfig version 6.2.8-30.el7"
