Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7585:

**Verification:**

The commit message `src/flac.c: Improve error handling` along with the changelog entry for libsndfile version 1.0.28 (`Fix buffer overruns in FLAC and ID3 handling code`) directly relate to the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7585. The Gentoo Security Advisory also explicitly lists CVE-2017-7585 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in libsndfile version 1.0.28.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the FLAC and ID3 handling code of libsndfile, specifically within `src/flac.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The code did not properly validate buffer sizes when processing FLAC and ID3 metadata, leading to a buffer overflow condition when parsing crafted files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted audio file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.
- **Denial of Service:** Malformed files could also cause a denial of service condition if the application crashes due to the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Parsing:** The primary attack vector is through the processing of specially crafted audio files containing malicious FLAC or ID3 metadata.
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a malicious file to an application using the vulnerable libsndfile library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malformed audio file containing malicious FLAC or ID3 data.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open or process the malicious file using a vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves improved error handling, indicating a lack of proper validation before the fix was introduced.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The commit diff shows changes to `src/flac.c`, specifically in the `flac_read_loop` and `flac_buffer_copy` functions related to handling FLAC data.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker by enticing a user to open a specially crafted file.
