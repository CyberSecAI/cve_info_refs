Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7953:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the comment fields of INFOR EAM V11.0 Build 201410. Specifically, the application fails to prevent users from inserting arbitrary JavaScript code into comment fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is persistently stored within the application's database (in this case, within comments).

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  **Credential theft:** An attacker can potentially steal user cookies, which may contain session tokens and potentially lead to account takeover, including administrative accounts.
-  **Data leakage:** Sensitive data displayed on the page could be extracted by the injected script and sent to a malicious server.
- **Malware distribution:**  The vulnerability can be exploited to redirect users to malicious websites or prompt them to download malware.
- **Full control:**  By gaining administrative access, an attacker could have full control over the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user inserts a comment containing JavaScript code.
- Any other authenticated user who views the comment will have the script executed within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account for the EAM application and be able to add comments.
- The attacker does not need to have any special privileges or be in a specific network position besides being an authenticated user.
