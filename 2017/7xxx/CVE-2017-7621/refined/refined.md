- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The eMLi web application does not properly validate or encode user input within the output it generates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts into the application, potentially leading to:
    - Account hijacking
    - Website defacement
    - Stealing credentials
    - Sensitive data leaks
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL with an embedded script that is executed when a user visits the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that is then visited by a user of the application. The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the application as a student in the student portal before exploiting the vulnerability.
