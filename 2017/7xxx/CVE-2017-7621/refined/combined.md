### Cross Site Scripting Vuulnerability in core-eMLi in eMLi V1.0 allows an Attacker to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end user.

###

### **What is Cross Site Scripting ?**

           Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

### Impact Scenario :

     1. Account Hijacking
     2. Website Defacement
     3. Stealing Credentials
     4. Sensitive Data Leak

**Affected Versions :**

                    eMLi : School Management - 1.0
               eMLi : College Campus Management - 1.0

eMLi : University Management - 1.0

**Vulnerability Reproduction Steps(POC):**

             Step 1: Visit URL of any Affected Versions

### **Step 2:** Login to student portal**.**

Step 3:  Replace URL with this
> [host] /core-emli/code/student\_
>
> portal/home.php?page=%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x%3Cscript%3Ealert%28String.fromCharCode%2888%2C%2083%2C%2083%29%29%3C%2fscript%3E

            Step 4: The final URL which we have generated will generate a dialog box with XSS label on webpage. An Attacker can get whole access to whole system with specially crafted malicious script.
