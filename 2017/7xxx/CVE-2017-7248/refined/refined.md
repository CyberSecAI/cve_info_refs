Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE-2017-7248** is related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Gazelle torrent tracker software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the `type` HTTP GET parameter. This parameter is passed to the `transcode.php` file located in the `sections/better` directory of the Gazelle software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the output, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, which will be executed in the victim's browser in the context of the vulnerable website. This can potentially lead to various attacks, including:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.
    - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information on the page or related to the user.
    - Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `type` parameter. 
- Specifically, the vulnerable URL is: `http://localhost/.../Gazelle-master/sections/better/transcode.php?type=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user of the Gazelle website.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned, the vulnerability can be exploited by a regular user.
