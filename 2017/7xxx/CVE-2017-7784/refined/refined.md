{
  "CVE-2017-7784": {
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when reading an image observer during frame reconstruction after the observer has been freed. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs because an image observer is accessed after it has been freed, during frame reconstruction.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"

    "Attack vectors": [
      "Triggering a specific sequence of DOM manipulations, including image loading and frame reconstruction"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the DOM, including triggering image loading and frame reconstruction."
