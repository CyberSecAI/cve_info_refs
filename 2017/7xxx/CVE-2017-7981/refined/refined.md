Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `SyntaxHighlighter` plugin of PHPWiki, which is used as a plugin in Tuleap.
*   The vulnerable plugin passes the `syntax` argument directly to the PHP `proc_open()` function, which executes operating system commands. This lack of sanitization allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By crafting a specific input within the `syntax` parameter of the `SyntaxHighlighter` plugin, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute code on the server hosting the Tuleap application.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** As the code executes with the permissions of the webserver user (codendiadm in the provided example), it could lead to a full system compromise if not properly contained.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:**  With the ability to execute arbitrary commands, attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wiki Page Editing:** The attack vector involves editing or creating a PHPWiki page within a Tuleap project.
*   **SyntaxHighlighter Plugin:** The specific vulnerability resides in how the `SyntaxHighlighter` plugin handles user-supplied input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Tuleap platform.
*   **Wiki Access:** The attacker must have the ability to edit wiki pages within a project in Tuleap. This can include unprivileged users who have access to a project wiki.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction beyond visiting a malicious wiki page.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable code is within the `SyntaxHighlighter` plugin in PHPWiki versions prior to 1.5.5. It uses the `proc_open()` function with unsanitized input from the `syntax` parameter.
*   **Exploitation Example:** An attacker would insert a string like `<?plugin SyntaxHighlighter syntax="c;id" a ?>` into the wiki page content. This example shows the execution of the "id" command on the server.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability is present in Tuleap versions 8.3 to 9.6.99.86 due to the included version of PHPWiki (1.3.10).

**CVSS Score:**

*   The reported CVSSv3 score is 8.8 (from the Tuleap tracker)  or 9.4 (from the github/exploit-db)
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) or (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:U/RC:C), indicating a high severity vulnerability. The CVSS score of 9.4 reflects a scope change.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by removing the vulnerable plugins and upgrading the version of PHPWiki.
