Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7154:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `process_policy` syscall within the macOS kernel. Specifically, when calling this syscall with `PROC_POLICY_SCOPE_PROCESS`, `PROC_POLICY_ACTION_GET`, `PROC_POLICY_RESOURCE_USAGE`, and `PROC_POLICY_RUSAGE_CPU`, an uninitialized field from the kernel stack is copied to userspace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Memory Exposure:** The core issue is the lack of initialization of the `ppattr_cpu_attr` field within the `cpuattr` structure. Due to a conditional check within the kernel, this field may remain uninitialized under certain circumstances.
*   **Information Leak:**  The uninitialized memory is copied from the kernel stack to a user-controlled buffer, leading to a potential information leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Stack Leak:** An attacker can read arbitrary data from the kernel stack by triggering this vulnerability. The leaked memory could contain sensitive information.
*   **Local Denial of Service (DoS) or Kernel Memory Read:** The Apple advisory states "A local user may be able to cause unexpected system termination or read kernel memory"
*   **Potential for further exploits:** The information leakage could potentially aid an attacker in developing further exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user with the ability to make system calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the ability to execute code and make system calls.
*   No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability, although the leaked kernel stack may contain information useful for privilege escalation attempts.

**Technical Details (from exploit-db):**

*   The exploit-db entry describes the exact sequence of calls leading to the vulnerability: `process_policy` -> `handle_cpuuse` -> `proc_get_task_ruse_cpu` -> `task_get_cpuusage`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when `task_get_cpuusage` does not set any of the `TASK_RUSECPU_FLAGS_*` flags, causing `proc_get_task_ruse_cpu()` to not write data into `*policyp`, thus keeping `cpuattr.ppattr_cpu_attr` uninitialized.
*   The `copyout` function then copies the uninitialized value to userspace.
*   The provided C code demonstrates a proof-of-concept exploit that triggers the leak.

**Affected Platforms:**

*   The vulnerability affects macOS and is fixed in macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 and Security Updates 2017-002 for Sierra and 2017-005 for El Capitan.
* The vulnerability also affects iOS and tvOS according to the Apple security advisories and is fixed in iOS 11.2 and tvOS 11.2.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `exploit-db` entry provides a very detailed technical analysis and a functional exploit.

In summary, CVE-2017-7154 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the macOS kernel where an uninitialized field is exposed from kernel stack memory to user space.
