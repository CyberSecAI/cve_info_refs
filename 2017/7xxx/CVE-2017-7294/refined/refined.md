      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `vmw_surface_define_ioctl()` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c`. User-controlled values `req->mip_levels[i]` are not checked for an upper limit. These are used to calculate `num_sizes`. Both `num_sizes` and the array are `uint32_t`, so it is possible to cause an overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds write and/or kernel lockup.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write",
        "Lack of proper input sanitization for user-provided data",
         "Use of user-controlled values without checking their upper limit"
      ],
      "impact": "Out-of-bounds write can lead to privilege escalation, although it is considered unlikely. Kernel lock-up can cause a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can send a crafted ioctl request to the `vmw_surface_define_ioctl` function via the `drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c` driver.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local user able to make system calls."
