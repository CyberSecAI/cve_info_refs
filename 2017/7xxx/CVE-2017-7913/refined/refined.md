Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7913:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Plaintext storage of passwords in the application's configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password):** The application stores password parameters in cleartext within its configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can obtain credentials by accessing the configuration file and reading the plaintext passwords. This could grant unauthorized access to the device or associated systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based attacks, where an attacker gains access to the device's filesystem or configuration files. This could be achieved through remote access vulnerabilities or through network breaches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Moxa OnCell device and the ability to read the configuration file containing the passwords. This could involve compromising the network hosting the devices, exploiting a different vulnerability to access device files or if the device itself was accessible from an insecure network.
