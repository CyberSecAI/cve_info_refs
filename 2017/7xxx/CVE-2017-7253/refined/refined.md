Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
1.  **Information Disclosure:** The Dahua IP camera allows unauthenticated access to a list of all users via a request to an "abstract URI".
2.  **Authentication Bypass:** After obtaining usernames, the attacker can leverage a flaw in the login process to bypass authentication and log in with administrator credentials. This seems to involve a login challenge response that is improperly handled allowing a second login request to succeed using the previously obtained session ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unrestricted access to user information, likely including usernames and possibly other details.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Flawed implementation of the login mechanism that does not properly handle login challenges and session management. This allows an attacker to reuse a session id to gain admin access after initially only a low privilege login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker gains full control of the target IP camera. This allows them to:
    *   View live video feeds.
    *   Manipulate camera settings and configuration.
    *   Potentially use the camera to further compromise the network it is connected to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Dahua IP camera.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit involves sending specific HTTP requests to the camera's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the IP camera over a network.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests.
*   **No prior authentication is needed to get a user list and a session id:** The first stage of the attack does not require authentication.
* **Low privilege access is required to get session ID and login:** A low privilege login is required to get a session ID, before re-logging in with admin credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text mentions that more information will be provided after 90 days.
* The exploit relies on the default low-privilege credentials, indicating that this attack is easier if the default credentials have not been changed.
