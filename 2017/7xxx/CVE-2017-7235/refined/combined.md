## Description

[![@franciscouzo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1223983?v=4&size=48)](/franciscouzo)[franciscouzo](https://github.com/franciscouzo)opened [on Mar 22, 2017](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape/issues/97#issue-215943723)

My recommendation would be to remove the dependency on `js2py`, but it looks like you don't want to go that way (Please see [this comment](https://github.com/PiotrDabkowski/Js2Py/issues/45#issuecomment-258724406)), at least disable the `pyimport` statement, since it gives arbitrary code execution to any website that's scraped. And add the disclaimer that this library runs arbitrary code back to the README (which was removed in this [commit](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape/commit/90bf1696d20a2cb1803fca9c0bf9e7835c10cda6)).

You should also request a CVE ID.
