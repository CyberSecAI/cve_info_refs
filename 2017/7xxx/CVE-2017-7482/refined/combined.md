## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-04-27 15:18:07 UTC  ``` When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an rxrpc-type key, the length of a variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to overrun the allocated buffer space.  The data is padded to the nearest four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra four-byte aligned padding.  This can lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer accessing or reading past the end of the buffer.  The read functionality could allow for a 3 byte infoleak and the write flaw could allow for an uncontrolled 3 byte write to kernels slab memory.  This could lead to memory corruption and possible privilege escalation although no known exploit exists at the time of writing.  Discussion an a CVE-ID assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q2/602>  Upstream fix <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5f2f97656ada8d811d3c1bef503ced266fcd53a0>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-04-27 15:24:24 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Shi Lei (Qihoo 360 Gear Team)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c3)  Wade Mealing    2017-05-19 03:26:10 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,6 and 7 as the module is not enabled on these systems.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG-2.  Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c6)  Wade Mealing    2017-06-26 08:06:23 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1464888](show_bug.cgi?id=1464888 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-7482 kernel: net/rxrpc: overflow in decoding of krb5 principal [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c8)  Evgenii Shatokhin    2017-06-29 12:12:54 UTC  ``` As far as I can see in the kernel sources for the version 3.10.0-514.26.1 in RHEL 7, the affected code (from net/rxrpc/ar-key.c) is only built when CONFIG_AF_RXRPC is set. However, that kernel and at least some earlier ones have "# CONFIG_AF_RXRPC is not set" in their config files.  So RHEL 7 is actually not affected by this issue, right? Or, perhaps, I am missing something.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c9)  Wade Mealing    2017-07-04 01:13:48 UTC  ``` You're 100% right, I had originally grepped the config for CONFIG_RX_RPC not CONFIG_AF_RX_RPC.  Kernel-rt/MRG-2 still seems to use this as a module it remains affected.  Closing trackers for 6 and 7 adjusting statement.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c10)  Justin M. Forbes    2018-01-29 17:17:40 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with 4.11.8 stable updates   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-03-26 07:45:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2019:0641 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0641](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0641)   ``` |  |

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# CVE-2017-7482 Linux kernel: krb5 ticket decode len check.

Gday,

David Howells has written a great description, so rather than reword what
he's written here is a quote directly from the git commit.

```

---
    When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into
an
    rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a
    variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to
    overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest
    four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This
could
    lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going
    over the end of the buffer.

    Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the
padded
    length.

possibly corrupt 3 bytes of memory,

                 CVE-2017-1000365

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2014-9940

    A use-after-free flaw in the voltage and current regulator driver
    could allow a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially
    escalate privileges.

CVE-2017-7346

    Li Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual GPUs does
    not properly check user-controlled values in the
    vmw_surface_define_ioctl() functions for upper limits. A local user
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-7482

    Shi Lei discovered that RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code does
    not properly verify metadata, leading to information disclosure,
    denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-7533

    Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao discovered a race condition between inotify
    events and VFS rename operations allowing an unprivileged local
    attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

CVE-2017-7541

    A buffer overflow flaw in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n PCIe SoftMAC WLAN
    driver could allow a local user to cause kernel memory corruption,
    leading to a denial of service or potentially privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-7542

    An integer overflow vulnerability in the ip6_find_1stfragopt()
    function was found allowing a local attacker with privileges to open
    raw sockets to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-7889

    Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler reported that the mm subsystem does
    not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection mechanism,
    allowing a local attacker with access to /dev/mem to obtain
    sensitive information or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-9605

    Murray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual
    GPUs does not properly initialize memory, potentially allowing a
    local attacker to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
    kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.

CVE-2017-10911 / XSA-216

    Anthony Perard of Citrix discovered an information leak flaw in Xen
    blkif response handling, allowing a malicious unprivileged guest to
    obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.

CVE-2017-11176

    It was discovered that the mq_notify() function does not set the
    sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. An attacker
    can take advantage of this flaw during a userspace close of a
    Netlink socket to cause a denial of service or potentially cause
    other impact.

CVE-2017-1000363

    Roee Hay reported that the lp driver does not properly bounds-check
    passed arguments, allowing a local attacker with write access to the
    kernel command line arguments to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000365

    It was discovered that argument and environment pointers are not
    taken properly into account to the imposed size restrictions on
    arguments and environmental strings passed through
    RLIMIT_STACK/RLIMIT_INFINITY. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw in conjunction with other flaws to execute arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-04-27 15:18:07 UTC  ``` When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an rxrpc-type key, the length of a variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to overrun the allocated buffer space.  The data is padded to the nearest four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra four-byte aligned padding.  This can lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer accessing or reading past the end of the buffer.  The read functionality could allow for a 3 byte infoleak and the write flaw could allow for an uncontrolled 3 byte write to kernels slab memory.  This could lead to memory corruption and possible privilege escalation although no known exploit exists at the time of writing.  Discussion an a CVE-ID assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q2/602>  Upstream fix <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5f2f97656ada8d811d3c1bef503ced266fcd53a0>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-04-27 15:24:24 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Shi Lei (Qihoo 360 Gear Team)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c3)  Wade Mealing    2017-05-19 03:26:10 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,6 and 7 as the module is not enabled on these systems.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG-2.  Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c6)  Wade Mealing    2017-06-26 08:06:23 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1464888](show_bug.cgi?id=1464888 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-7482 kernel: net/rxrpc: overflow in decoding of krb5 principal [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c8)  Evgenii Shatokhin    2017-06-29 12:12:54 UTC  ``` As far as I can see in the kernel sources for the version 3.10.0-514.26.1 in RHEL 7, the affected code (from net/rxrpc/ar-key.c) is only built when CONFIG_AF_RXRPC is set. However, that kernel and at least some earlier ones have "# CONFIG_AF_RXRPC is not set" in their config files.  So RHEL 7 is actually not affected by this issue, right? Or, perhaps, I am missing something.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c9)  Wade Mealing    2017-07-04 01:13:48 UTC  ``` You're 100% right, I had originally grepped the config for CONFIG_RX_RPC not CONFIG_AF_RX_RPC.  Kernel-rt/MRG-2 still seems to use this as a module it remains affected.  Closing trackers for 6 and 7 adjusting statement.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c10)  Justin M. Forbes    2018-01-29 17:17:40 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with 4.11.8 stable updates   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1446288#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-03-26 07:45:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2019:0641 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0641](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0641)   ``` |  |

rxrpc: Fix several cases where a padded len isn't checked in ticket decodeThis fixes CVE-2017-7482.
When a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an
rxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a
variable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to
overrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest
four-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra. This could
lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going
over the end of the buffer.
Fix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded
length.

![Edge computing wave illustration](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/ohc-grid-pattern-548x226.jpg)

### Clarify your cloud vision

Put open source flexibility to work for hybrid cloud. This approach empowers IT to bridge diverse environments and use each one to its fullest―without binding future resources. It enables you to respond to shifts in demand, industry changes, or your own IT priorities.

[See what it takes](/en/topics/cloud/open-hybrid-cloud-approach)

![a trusted leader in innovation](https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/companyinfo_trustedleader_v2.svg)

### Open hybrid cloud

We believe in the power of open hybrid cloud. Standalone cloud deployments based on proprietary technology inhibit clouds from interacting with one another. An open hybrid cloud strategy brings the interoperability, workload portability, and flexibility of open source software to hybrid enterprise environments.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-7346

    Li Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual GPUs does
    not properly check user-controlled values in the
    vmw_surface_define_ioctl() functions for upper limits. A local user
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-7482

    Shi Lei discovered that RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code does
    not properly verify metadata, leading to information disclosure,
    denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-7533

    Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao discovered a race condition between inotify
    events and VFS rename operations allowing an unprivileged local
    attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

CVE-2017-7541

    A buffer overflow flaw in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n PCIe SoftMAC WLAN
    driver could allow a local user to cause kernel memory corruption,
    leading to a denial of service or potentially privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-7542

    An integer overflow vulnerability in the ip6_find_1stfragopt()
    function was found allowing a local attacker with privileges to open
    raw sockets to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-9605

    Murray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual
    GPUs does not properly initialize memory, potentially allowing a
    local attacker to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
    kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.

CVE-2017-10810

    Li Qiang discovered a memory leak flaw within the VirtIO GPU driver
    resulting in denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2017-10911 / XSA-216

    Anthony Perard of Citrix discovered an information leak flaw in Xen
    blkif response handling, allowing a malicious unprivileged guest to
    obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.

CVE-2017-11176

    It was discovered that the mq_notify() function does not set the
    sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. An attacker
    can take advantage of this flaw during a user-space close of a
    Netlink socket to cause a denial of service or potentially cause
    other impact.

CVE-2017-1000365

    It was discovered that argument and environment pointers are not
    taken properly into account to the imposed size restrictions on
    arguments and environmental strings passed through
    RLIMIT_STACK/RLIMIT_INFINITY. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw in conjunction with other flaws to execute arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed in
a subsequent DSA.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
