  "summary": "CVE-2017-7482 is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code where it doesn't properly verify metadata. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "details": [
    {
      "type": "vulnerability",
      "description": "The Kerberos 5 ticket decoding process in RXRPC keys doesn't account for padding, which can cause the size-remaining variable to wrap, leading to out-of-bounds access.",
      "affected_component": "net/rxrpc/key.c",
      "attack_vector": "Decoding Kerberos 5 tickets when using RXRPC keys.",
      "impact": "Information disclosure (3 byte infoleak), memory corruption, denial of service, possible privilege escalation, uncontrolled 3 byte write to kernel slab memory.",
      "root_cause": "The code incorrectly assumes the size of a field when decoding Kerberos 5 tickets.  The data is padded to the nearest four-byte boundary, and the code doesn't check for this extra four-byte aligned padding.",
      "remediation": "Apply the patch referenced in the upstream fix: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5f2f97656ada8d811d3c1bef503ced266fcd53a0"

      "condition": "Vulnerable code is only built when CONFIG_AF_RXRPC is set.",
      "note": "Kernel-rt/MRG-2 uses this as a module and remains affected."
