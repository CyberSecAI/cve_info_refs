Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper privilege evaluation within the OpenText Documentum Content Server when processing crafted RPC save-commands. Specifically, the server doesn't adequately check the privileges required to create and save certain objects, allowing a user with limited privileges to create a malicious object that can elevate their own privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Privilege Checks:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks when saving objects using RPC calls. This allows a user to create an object that should normally require higher privileges.
- **Insecure Object Creation:** The provided Python scripts demonstrate the creation of a `dm_registered` object with specific properties that are usually restricted to superusers. The crafted object manipulates the `dm_user_s` table, which stores user privilege information.
- **SQL Injection (Indirect):** While not a direct SQL injection, the vulnerability allows an attacker to indirectly execute SQL queries with elevated privileges by manipulating the object creation process, which later executes SQL to update user privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A regular user can escalate their privileges to that of a superuser (also referred to as "p0wned" in the exploit scripts). This gives the attacker full control over the Documentum Content Server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** With superuser privileges, the attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete any data within the system, install malicious software, and perform other harmful actions.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could exfiltrate sensitive documents, configuration files, and user information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network by sending specially crafted RPC save-commands to the server.
- **RPC Interface:** The attack vector is through the documented and intended RPC interface of Documentum Content Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Documentum Content Server.
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs a valid, though low-privileged, user account on the Documentum system.
- **Knowledge of RPC protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious RPC calls, which is provided in the provided python exploits.
- **Python programming capabilities:** Attacker needs to be able to use provided python exploits or re-implement them.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was initially discovered in 2013, and previous attempts by the vendor to remediate it were unsuccessful, as indicated in the description.
- The provided Python scripts (`CVE-2017-7220-01.py` and `CVE-2017-7220-02.py`) serve as Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits.
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of Documentum Content Server, as stated in the security advisory.
- The CVSS v3 Base Score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High), highlighting the potential severity of this vulnerability.
