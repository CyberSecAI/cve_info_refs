Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `frame-ancestors` directive within Content Security Policy (CSP). Specifically, when a CSP `frame-ancestors` directive includes origins with paths (e.g., `https://example.com/path`), the browser incorrectly performs comparisons against the entire path instead of just the origin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Origin Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a cross-origin information leak. By including paths in the `frame-ancestors` directive, a website could inadvertently reveal path information to a malicious iframe. The iframe can check if it is loaded within a specific path of a permitted origin, thus leaking this path information.

*   **Incorrect CSP Enforcement:** The browser's CSP enforcement mechanism improperly handles paths within the `frame-ancestors` directive leading to unexpected behavior and security flaws.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential for attackers to learn the specific paths of resources within a website, even when Referrer Policy mechanisms are used to limit referrer information.
*   **Spoofing:** Although not directly, by knowing specific paths within a target origin, it can be easier to create pages that can appear legit or bypass other security mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Iframe:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage with an embedded iframe.
*   **Vulnerable Website:** The target website has a CSP using `frame-ancestors` with paths included in the allowed origins.
*   **Path Leakage:** The malicious iframe can determine the path of the parent page by checking if the frame loads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and control its content.
*   **Knowledge of the Target Website's CSP:** The attacker needs to know that the target website uses a `frame-ancestors` directive with paths in it.
*   **No Direct Code Execution:** The vulnerability doesn't allow direct code execution, it is an information disclosure issue which might help in other exploits.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the browser's enforcement code compares the full URI, including the path, instead of stripping the path and comparing only the origin.
*   The fix involves modifying the CSP enforcement logic to only compare origins when processing `frame-ancestors` directives.
*   The fix ensures that paths are ignored when determining if a frame is allowed to load per the `frame-ancestors` directive.
*   The issue was addressed by modifying the CSP parser and the enforcement mechanism to handle paths correctly. Specifically, the patch ensures that path comparison is ignored when enforcing the `FRAME_ANCESTORS_DIRECTIVE`.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 55.
