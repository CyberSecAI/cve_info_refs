{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an invalid Unicode property lookup within the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library when handling code values exceeding the Unicode maximum (0x10ffff) in non-UTF mode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially trigger a crash or denial-of-service by processing a crafted input using the PCRE library. This could occur when the library attempts to look up a Unicode property for a code point that is out of range in a non-UTF mode context.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted input file processed by PCRE"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to provide a crafted input to an application using the vulnerable PCRE library."
