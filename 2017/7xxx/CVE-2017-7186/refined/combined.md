# PCRE2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201710-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in PCRE2, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libpcre2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **10.30** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **10.30** |

### Background

PCRE2 is a project based on PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions)
which has a new and revised API.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PCRE2. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or have
other unspecified impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PCRE2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre2-10.30"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

# PCRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201710-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the PCRE Library, the
worst of which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libpcre** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **8.41** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **8.41** |

### Background

The PCRE Library provides functions for Perl-compatible regular
expressions.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in The PCRE Library.
Please review the references below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition or
other unspecified impacts via a specially crafted file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PCRE users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre-8.41"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

# libpcre: invalid memory read in match (pcre\_exec.c)

Posted on [March 14, 2017](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2017/03/14/libpcre-invalid-memory-read-in-match-pcre_exec-c/ "4:47 pm") by [ago](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/author/ago/ "View all posts by ago")

**Description**:

[libpcre](http://www.pcre.org) is a perl-compatible regular expression library.

A fuzz on libpcre1 through the pcretest utility revealed an invalid read in the library. For who is interested in a detailed description of the bug, will follow a feedback from upstream:

> This was a genuine bug in the 32-bit library. Thanks for finding it. The crash was caused by trying to find a Unicode property for a code value greater than 0x10ffff, the Unicode maximum, when running in non-UTF mode (where character values can be up to 0xffffffff). The bug was in both PCRE1 and PCRE2. I have fixed both of them.

The complete ASan output:

```
# pcretest -32 -d $FILE
==14788==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x7f1bbffed4df (pc 0x7f1bbee3fe6b bp 0x7fff8b50d8c0 sp 0x7fff8b50d3a0 T0)
