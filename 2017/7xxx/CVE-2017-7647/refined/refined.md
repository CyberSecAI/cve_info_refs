- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the CMC (Command and Control) restricted shell, allowing for arbitrary command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary command injection vulnerability. An authenticated user can execute arbitrary commands from the CMC restricted shell.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user interacts with the CMC restricted shell by injecting malicious commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the CMC restricted shell.
