Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7303:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing check for null section pointers when following `sh_link` fields in the `strip` utility within the binutils package. Specifically, the `find_link` function in `elf.c` attempts to access members of an `Elf_Internal_Shdr` structure without verifying if the pointer to the structure is valid, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The core vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `find_link` function within `elf.c`. This occurs when the `sh_link` field of a section header points to a non-existent or invalid section.
- **Lack of input validation/sanitization:** The `strip` utility fails to validate if section header references, like `sh_link`, point to valid locations in memory before accessing them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, causing the `strip` utility to crash. This can be triggered by processing a crafted, malformed ELF file, thereby causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious ELF file:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing the `strip` utility with a specifically crafted ELF file. This ELF file will have an invalid `sh_link` field which leads to a null pointer dereference when the `strip` utility attempts to process it.
- **File manipulation:** An attacker can create or modify ELF files to include the malicious structure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed ELF file as input to the `strip` utility. This can be achieved in a number of ways such as providing the file directly, or having the target application process untrusted files.
