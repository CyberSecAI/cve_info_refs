Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-7800:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the handling of WebSockets during disconnection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Use-after-free: The object holding the WebSocket connection can be prematurely freed before the disconnection operation is completed. This leads to the possibility of accessing memory that has already been deallocated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Exploitable crash: The use-after-free condition results in a crash, which can potentially be exploited by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by gaining control over the execution flow.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the disconnection phase of a WebSocket connection. This could be caused by:
    *   A malicious webpage containing JavaScript that triggers the vulnerability in Firefox/Thunderbird via a WebSocket connection
    *  A malformed websocket message causing the disconnection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker would need the ability to establish a WebSocket connection with the vulnerable application (Firefox or Thunderbird) and control the timing or sequence of actions that trigger the disconnect operation. This could be done by creating a malicious website that is accessed via a vulnerable browser or by crafting a malicious message that can trigger a disconnection.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in multiple Red Hat products including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 as well as Firefox and Thunderbird.
*   The fix for the vulnerability involves updating Firefox and Thunderbird to version 52.3.0 ESR (Firefox) and 52.3.0 (Thunderbird), respectively.
*  The vulnerability was reported by Looben Yang.
*   Multiple sources indicate the impact of this vulnerability is 'Critical'.
*   The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory MFSA2017-19 and MFSA2017-20 specifically mention this CVE ID.
