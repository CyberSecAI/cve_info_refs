|  | An issue was discovered in Contiki Operating System 3.0. |
|  | Use-after-free vulnerability in httpd-simple.c in cc26xx-web-demo httpd, where upon a connection |
|  | close event, the http\_state structure was not deallocated properly, |
|  | resulting in a null pointer dereference in the output processing |
|  | function. This resulted in a board crash, which can be used to perform |
|  | denial of service. |

|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | [Suggested description] |
|  | An issue was discovered in Contiki Operating System 3.0. |
|  | A Persistent XSS vulnerability is present in the MQTT/IBM Cloud Config page (aka mqtt.html) of |
|  | cc26xx-web-demo. |
|  | The cc26xx-web-demo features a webserver that runs on a constrained |
|  | device. That particular page allows a user to remotely configure that |
|  | device's operation by sending HTTP POST requests. The vulnerability |
|  | consists of improper input sanitisation on the text fields on the |
|  | MQTT/IBM Cloud config page, allowing for JavaScript code injection. |
|  |  |
