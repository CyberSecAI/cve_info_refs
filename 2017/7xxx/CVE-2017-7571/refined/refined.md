The provided content is related to CVE-2017-7571.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection on the `/public/rolechangeadmin/USER_ID` endpoint in Faveo Helpdesk version Community 1.9.3.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The application does not properly validate the origin of requests to change user roles. This allows an attacker to forge a request that, when executed by an authenticated user, changes the user's role in the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can manipulate the role of an "agent" user to "admin" without their knowledge, leading to privilege escalation. This allows the attacker to gain full access to the backend of the application and compromise the entire web application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page (CSRF PoC) that makes a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker tricks an authenticated "agent" user into loading this page, for instance by sending a link via email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to trick an authenticated "agent" user to load the malicious HTML page while being authenticated in the Faveo Helpdesk application.
