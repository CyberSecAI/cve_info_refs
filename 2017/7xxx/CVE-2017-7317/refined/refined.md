The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Humax Digital HG100R devices, and one of them is related to CVE-2017-7317.

**CVE-2017-7317:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The default credentials for the router's web application are not declared in the manual, and they can be found within the router's backup file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the fact that root credentials can be extracted from the backup file which is downloadable without authentication and are not explicitly mentioned in the user manual. This allows unauthorized access to the router's web interface.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain full access to the router's web interface by extracting root credentials from the backup file, leading to complete control over the device.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can download the backup file (`GatewaySettings.bin`) from the router via HTTP.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have network access to the router's web interface to download the backup file. Basic knowledge of using `wget` and `strings` commands is also needed to obtain the credentials.
