- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an absolute path traversal, which allows an attacker to manipulate file paths to access restricted files or directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to absolute path traversal (CWE-36), allowing an attacker to access files or directories outside of the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to traverse the file system and gain access to files or directories, potentially leading to the device becoming unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
