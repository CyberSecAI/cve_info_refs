## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Synopsis

Moderate: rh-postgresql95-postgresql security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2677)

## Topic

An update for rh-postgresql95-postgresql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-postgresql95-postgresql (9.5.9). (BZ#1484637, BZ#1484642, BZ#1484648)

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that authenticating to a PostgreSQL database account with an empty password was possible despite libpq's refusal to send an empty password. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to gain access to database accounts with empty passwords. (CVE-2017-7546)
* An authorization flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled access to the pg\_user\_mappings view on foreign servers. A remote, authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to retrieve passwords from the user mappings defined by the foreign server owners without actually having the privileges to do so. (CVE-2017-7547)
* An authorization flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled large objects. A remote, authenticated attacker with no privileges on a large object could potentially use this flaw to overwrite the entire content of the object, thus resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-7548)

Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Ben de Graaff, Jelte Fennema, and Jeroen van der Ham as the original reporters of CVE-2017-7546; Jeff Janes as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7547; and Chapman Flack as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7548.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

If the postgresql service is running, it will be automatically restarted after installing this update.

# E.21. Release 9.6.4

**Release date:** 2017-08-10

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.6.3. For information about new features in the 9.6 major release, see [Section E.25](release-9-6.html).

## E.21.1. Migration to Version 9.6.4

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.6.X.

However, if you use foreign data servers that make use of user passwords for authentication, see the first changelog entry below.

Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.6.3, see [Section E.22](release-9-6-3.html).

## E.21.2. Changes

* Further restrict visibility of pg\_user\_mappings.umoptions, to protect passwords stored as user mapping options (Noah Misch)

  The fix for CVE-2017-7486 was incorrect: it allowed a user to see the options in her own user mapping, even if she did not have USAGE permission on the associated foreign server. Such options might include a password that had been provided by the server owner rather than the user herself. Since information\_schema.user\_mapping\_options does not show the options in such cases, pg\_user\_mappings should not either. (CVE-2017-7547)

  By itself, this patch will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd databases. If you wish to apply this change in an existing database, you will need to do the following:

  1. Restart the postmaster after adding allow\_system\_table\_mods = true to postgresql.conf. (In versions supporting ALTER SYSTEM, you can use that to make the configuration change, but you'll still need a restart.)
  2. In each database of the cluster, run the following commands as superuser:

     ```
     SET search_path = pg_catalog;
     CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW pg_user_mappings AS
         SELECT
             U.oid       AS umid,
             S.oid       AS srvid,
             S.srvname   AS srvname,
             U.umuser    AS umuser,
             CASE WHEN U.umuser = 0 THEN
                 'public'
             ELSE
                 A.rolname
             END AS usename,
             CASE WHEN (U.umuser <> 0 AND A.rolname = current_user
                          AND (pg_has_role(S.srvowner, 'USAGE')
                               OR has_server_privilege(S.oid, 'USAGE')))
                         OR (U.umuser = 0 AND pg_has_role(S.srvowner, 'USAGE'))
                         OR (SELECT rolsuper FROM pg_authid WHERE rolname = current_user)
                         THEN U.umoptions
                      ELSE NULL END AS umoptions
         FROM pg_user_mapping U
              LEFT JOIN pg_authid A ON (A.oid = U.umuser) JOIN
             pg_foreign_server S ON (U.umserver = S.oid);
     ```
  3. Do not forget to include the template0 and template1 databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later. To fix template0, you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections. In PostgreSQL 9.5 and later, you can use

     ```
     ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;
     ```

     and then after fixing template0, undo that with

     ```
     ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;
     ```

     In prior versions, instead use

     ```
     UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';
     UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';
     ```
  4. Finally, remove the allow\_system\_table\_mods configuration setting, and again restart the postmaster.
* Disallow empty passwords in all password-based authentication methods (Heikki Linnakangas)

  libpq ignores empty password specifications, and does not transmit them to the server. So, if a user's password has been set to the empty string, it's impossible to log in with that password via psql or other libpq-based clients. An administrator might therefore believe that setting the password to empty is equivalent to disabling password login. However, with a modified or non-libpq-based client, logging in could be possible, depending on which authentication method is configured. In particular the most common method, md5, accepted empty passwords. Change the server to reject empty passwords in all cases. (CVE-2017-7546)
* Make `lo_put()` check for UPDATE privilege on the target large object (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)

  `lo_put()` should surely require the same permissions as `lowrite()`, but the check was missing, allowing any user to change the data in a large object. (CVE-2017-7548)
* Correct the documentation about the process for upgrading standby servers with pg\_upgrade (Bruce Momjian)

  The previous documentation instructed users to start/stop the primary server after running pg\_upgrade but before syncing the standby servers. This sequence is unsafe.
* Fix concurrent locking of tuple update chains (Álvaro Herrera)

  If several sessions concurrently lock a tuple update chain with nonconflicting lock modes using an old snapshot, and they all succeed, it was possible for some of them to nonetheless fail (and conclude there is no live tuple version) due to a race condition. This had consequences such as foreign-key checks failing to see a tuple that definitely exists but is being updated concurrently.
* Fix potential data corruption when freezing a tuple whose XMAX is a multixact with exactly one still-interesting member (Teodor Sigaev)
* Avoid integer overflow and ensuing crash when sorting more than one billion tuples in-memory (Sergey Koposov)
* On Windows, retry process creation if we fail to reserve the address range for our shared memory in the new process (Tom Lane, Amit Kapila)

  This is expected to fix infrequent child-process-launch failures that are probably due to interference from antivirus products.
* Fix low-probability corruption of shared predicate-lock hash table in Windows builds (Thomas Munro, Tom Lane)
* Avoid logging clean closure of an SSL connection as though it were a connection reset (Michael Paquier)
* Prevent sending SSL session tickets to clients (Tom Lane)

  This fix prevents reconnection failures with ticket-aware client-side SSL code.
* Fix code for setting [tcp\_keepalives\_idle](runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-TCP-KEEPALIVES-IDLE) on Solaris (Tom Lane)
* Fix statistics collector to honor inquiry messages issued just after a postmaster shutdown and immediate restart (Tom Lane)

  Statistics inquiries issued within half a second of the previous postmaster shutdown were effectively ignored.
* Ensure that the statistics collector's receive buffer size is at least 100KB (Tom Lane)

  This reduces the risk of dropped statistics data on older platforms whose default receive buffer size is less than that.
* Fix possible creation of an invalid WAL segment when a standby is promoted just after it processes an XLOG\_SWITCH WAL record (Andres Freund)
* Fix walsender to exit promptly when client requests shutdown (Tom Lane)
* Fix SIGHUP and SIGUSR1 handling in walsender processes (Petr Jelinek, Andres Freund)
* Prevent walsender-triggered panics during shutdown checkpoints (Andres Freund, Michael Paquier)
* Fix unnecessarily slow restarts of walreceiver processes due to race condition in postmaster (Tom Lane)
* Fix leakage of small subtransactions spilled to disk during logical decoding (Andres Freund)

  This resulted in temporary files consuming excessive disk space.
* Reduce the work needed to build snapshots during creation of logical-decoding slots (Andres Freund, Petr Jelinek)

  The previous algorithm was infeasibly expensive on a server with a lot of open transactions.
* Fix race condition that could indefinitely delay creation of logical-decoding slots (Andres Freund, Petr Jelinek)
* Reduce overhead in processing syscache invalidation events (Tom Lane)

  This is particularly helpful for logical decoding, which triggers frequent cache invalidation.
* Remove incorrect heuristic used in some cases to estimate join selectivity based on the presence of foreign-key constraints (David Rowley)

  In some cases where a multi-column foreign key constraint existed but did not exactly match a query's join structure, the planner used an estimation heuristic that turns out not to work well at all. Revert such cases to the way they were estimated before 9.6.
* Fix cases where an INSERT or UPDATE assigns to more than one element of a column that is of domain-over-array type (Tom Lane)
* Allow window functions to be used in sub-SELECTs that are within the arguments of an aggregate function (Tom Lane)
* Ensure that a view's CHECK OPTIONS clause is enforced properly when the underlying table is a foreign table (Etsuro Fujita)

  Previously, the update might get pushed entirely to the foreign server, but the need to verify the view conditions was missed if so.
* Move autogenerated array types out of the way during ALTER ... RENAME (Vik Fearing)

  Previously, we would rename a conflicting autogenerated array type out of the way during CREATE; this fix extends that behavior to renaming operations.
* Fix dangling pointer in ALTER TABLE when there is a comment on a constraint belonging to the table (David Rowley)

  Re-applying the comment to the reconstructed constraint could fail with a weird error message, or even crash.
* Ensure that ALTER USER ... SET accepts all the syntax variants that ALTER ROLE ... SET does (Peter Eisentraut)
* Allow a foreign table's CHECK constraints to be initially NOT VALID (Amit Langote)

  CREATE TABLE silently drops NOT VALID specifiers for CHECK constraints, reasoning that the table must be empty so the constraint can be validated immediately. But this is wrong for CREATE FOREIGN TABLE, where there's no reason to suppose that the underlying table is empty, and even if it is it's no business of ours to decide that the constraint can be treated as valid going forward. Skip this "optimization" for foreign tables.
* Properly update dependency info when changing a datatype I/O function's argument or return type from opaque to the correct type (Heikki Linnakangas)

  CREATE TYPE updates I/O functions declared in this long-obsolete style, but it forgot to record a dependency on the type, allowing a subsequent DROP TYPE to leave broken function definitions behind.
* Allow parallelism in the query plan when COPY copies from a query's result (Andres Freund)
* Reduce memory usage when ANALYZE processes a tsvector column (Heikki Linnakangas)
* Fix unnecessary precision loss and sloppy rounding when multiplying or dividing money values by integers or floats (Tom Lane)
* Tighten checks for whitespace in functions that parse identifiers, such as `regprocedurein()` (Tom Lane)

  Depending on the prevailing locale, these functions could misinterpret fragments of multibyte characters as whitespace.
* Use relevant #define symbols from Perl while compiling PL/Perl (Ashutosh Sharma, Tom Lane)

  This avoids portability problems, typically manifesting as a "handshake" mismatch during library load, when working with recent Perl versions.
* In libpq, reset GSS/SASL and SSPI authentication state properly after a failed connection attempt (Michael Paquier)

  Failure to do this meant that when falling back from SSL to non-SSL connections, a GSS/SASL failure in the SSL attempt would always cause the non-SSL attempt to fail. SSPI did not fail, but it leaked memory.
* In psql, fix failure when COPY FROM STDIN is ended with a keyboard EOF signal and then another COPY FROM STDIN is attempted (Thomas Munro)

  This misbehavior was observed on BSD-derived platforms (including macOS), but not on most others.
* Fix pg\_dump and pg\_restore to emit REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW commands last (Tom Lane)

  This prevents errors during dump/restore when a materialized view refers to tables owned by a different user.
* Improve pg\_dump/pg\_restore's reporting of error conditions originating in zlib (Vladimir Kunschikov, Álvaro Herrera)
* Fix pg\_dump with the --clean option to drop event triggers as expected (Tom Lane)

  It also now correctly assigns ownership of event triggers; before, they were restored as being owned by the superuser running the restore script.
* Fix pg\_dump with the --clean option to not fail when the public schema doesn't exist (Stephen Frost)
* Fix pg\_dump to not emit invalid SQL for an empty operator class (Daniel Gustafsson)
* Fix pg\_dump output to stdout on Windows (Kuntal Ghosh)

  A compressed plain-text dump written to stdout would contain corrupt data due to failure to put the file descriptor into binary mode.
* Fix `pg_get_ruledef()` to print correct output for the ON SELECT rule of a view whose columns have been renamed (Tom Lane)

  In some corner cases, pg\_dump relies on `pg_get_ruledef()` to dump views, so that this error could result in dump/reload failures.
* Fix dumping of outer joins with empty constraints, such as the result of a NATURAL LEFT JOIN with no common columns (Tom Lane)
* Fix dumping of function expressions in the FROM clause in cases where the expression does not deparse into something that looks like a function call (Tom Lane)
* Fix pg\_basebackup output to stdout on Windows (Haribabu Kommi)

  A backup written to stdout would contain corrupt data due to failure to put the file descriptor into binary mode.
* Fix pg\_rewind to correctly handle files exceeding 2GB (Kuntal Ghosh, Michael Paquier)

  Ordinarily such files won't appear in PostgreSQL data directories, but they could be present in some cases.
* Fix pg\_upgrade to ensure that the ending WAL record does not have [wal\_level](runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-LEVEL) = minimum (Bruce Momjian)

  This condition could prevent upgraded standby servers from reconnecting.
* Fix pg\_xlogdump's computation of WAL record length (Andres Freund)
* In postgres\_fdw, re-establish connections to remote servers after ALTER SERVER or ALTER USER MAPPING commands (Kyotaro Horiguchi)

  This ensures that option changes affecting connection parameters will be applied promptly.
* In postgres\_fdw, allow cancellation of remote transaction control commands (Robert Haas, Rafia Sabih)

  This change allows us to quickly escape a wait for an unresponsive remote server in many more cases than previously.
* Increase MAX\_SYSCACHE\_CALLBACKS to provide more room for extensions (Tom Lane)
* Always use -fPIC, not -fpic, when building shared libraries with gcc (Tom Lane)

  This supports larger extension libraries on platforms where it makes a difference.
* In MSVC builds, handle the case where the openssl library is not within a VC subdirectory (Andrew Dunstan)
* In MSVC builds, add proper include path for libxml2 header files (Andrew Dunstan)

  This fixes a former need to move things around in standard Windows installations of libxml2.
* In MSVC builds, recognize a Tcl library that is named tcl86.lib (Noah Misch)
* In MSVC builds, honor PROVE\_FLAGS settings on vcregress.pl's command line (Andrew Dunstan)

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2678)

## Topic

An update for rh-postgresql94-postgresql is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-postgresql94-postgresql (9.4.14). (BZ#1484635, BZ#1484638, BZ#1484644)

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that authenticating to a PostgreSQL database account with an empty password was possible despite libpq's refusal to send an empty password. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to gain access to database accounts with empty passwords. (CVE-2017-7546)
* An authorization flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled access to the pg\_user\_mappings view on foreign servers. A remote, authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to retrieve passwords from the user mappings defined by the foreign server owners without actually having the privileges to do so. (CVE-2017-7547)
* An authorization flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled large objects. A remote, authenticated attacker with no privileges on a large object could potentially use this flaw to overwrite the entire content of the object, thus resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-7548)

Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Ben de Graaff, Jelte Fennema, and Jeroen van der Ham as the original reporters of CVE-2017-7546; Jeff Janes as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7547; and Chapman Flack as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7548.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

If the postgresql service is running, it will be automatically restarted after installing this update.

# 2017-08-10 Security Update Release

Posted on **2017-08-10** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported versions of our database system, including 9.6.4, 9.5.8, 9.4.13, 9.3.18, and 9.2.22. This release fixes three security issues. It also patches over 50 other bugs reported over the last three months. Users who are affected by the below security issues should update as soon as possible. Users affected by [CVE-2017-7547](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7547) will need to perform additional steps after upgrading to resolve the issue. Other users should plan to update at the next convenient downtime.

## Security Issues

Three security vulnerabilities have been closed by this release:

* [CVE-2017-7546](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7546): Empty password accepted in some authentication methods
* [CVE-2017-7547](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7547): The "pg\_user\_mappings" catalog view discloses passwords to users lacking server privileges
* [CVE-2017-7548](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7548): lo\_put() function ignores ACLs

## CVE-2017-7546: Empty password accepted in some authentication methods

libpq, and by extension any connection driver that utilizes libpq, ignores empty passwords and does not transmit them to the server. When using libpq or a libpq-based connection driver to perform password-based authentication methods, it would appear that setting an empty password would be the equivalent of disabling password login. However, using a non-libpq based connection driver could allow a client with an empty password to log in.

To fix this issue, this update disables empty passwords from being submitted in any of the password-based authentication methods. The server will reject any empty passwords from being set on accounts.

## CVE-2017-7547: The "pg\_user\_mappings" catalog view discloses passwords to users lacking server privileges

This fix pertains to the usage of the foreign data wrapper functionality, particularly for the user mapping feature.

Before this fix, a user had access to see the options in pg\_user\_mappings even if the user did not have the USAGE permission on the associated foreign server. This meant that a user could see details such as a password that might have been set by the server administrator rather than the user.

This fix will only fix the behavior in newly created clusters utilizing initdb. To fix this issue on existing systems, you will need to follow the below steps. For more details, please see the [release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/release-9-6-4.html).

1. In your postgresql.conf file, add the following:

   ```
   allow_system_table_mods = true

   ```
2. After adding that line, you will need to restart your PostgreSQL cluster.
3. In **each** database of the cluster, run the following commands as a superuser:

   ```
   SET search_path = pg_catalog;
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW pg_user_mappings AS
   SELECT
       U.oid       AS umid,
       S.oid       AS srvid,
       S.srvname   AS srvname,
       U.umuser    AS umuser,
       CASE WHEN U.umuser = 0 THEN
           'public'
       ELSE
           A.rolname
       END AS usename,
       CASE WHEN (U.umuser <> 0 AND A.rolname = current_user
                    AND (pg_has_role(S.srvowner, 'USAGE')
                         OR has_server_privilege(S.oid, 'USAGE')))
                   OR (U.umuser = 0 AND pg_has_role(S.srvowner, 'USAGE'))
                   OR (SELECT rolsuper FROM pg_authid WHERE rolname = current_user)
                   THEN U.umoptions
                ELSE NULL END AS umoptions
   FROM pg_user_mapping U
   LEFT JOIN pg_authid A ON (A.oid = U.umuser)
   JOIN pg_foreign_server S ON (U.umserver = S.oid);

   ```
4. You also need to run the command on your *template0* and *template1* databases, otherwise the vulnerability will exist in future databases that you create.

   First, you will need to allow *template0* to accept connections. In PostgreSQL 9.5 you can run the following:

   ```
   ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;

   ```

   In PostgreSQL 9.4 and below, you will have to run this command:

   ```
   UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = true WHERE datname = 'template0';

   ```

   Then, in your *template0* and *template1* databases, run the commands as describe in Step 3

   When you are done, you will need to disallow connections from *template0*. In PostgreSQL 9.5, you can run the following:

   ```
   ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;

   ```

   In PostgreSQL 9.4 and below, you will have to run the following:

   ```
   UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = false WHERE datname = 'template0';

   ```
5. Remove the following line from your postgresql.conf file:

   ```
   allow_system_table_mods = false

   ```
6. Restart your PostgreSQL cluster

For more details, please see the [release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/release-9-6-4.html).

## CVE-2017-7548: lo\_put() function ignores ACLs

The lo\_put() function should require the same permissions as lowrite(), but there was a missing permission check which would allow any user to change the data in a large object.

To fix this, the lo\_put() function was changed to check the UPDATE privileges on the target object.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

This update also fixes a number of bugs reported in the last few months. Some of these issues affect only version 9.6, but many affect all supported versions:

* pg\_upgrade: corrected the documentation about the process for upgrading standby servers to ensure the primary and standbys synchronized safely. Also includes a fix to ensure the last WAL record does not have "wal\_level = minimum" which would prevent standbys from connecting upon restart
* Fix for issue with a concurrent locking race condition that could cause some of the updates to fail
* Several fixes for low probability data corruption scenarios
* Fix to prevent crash when sorting more than one billion tuples in-memory
* Fix on Windows to retry creating a process if shared memory addresses could not be allocated, typically caused from antivirus software interference
* Fix in libpq to ensure that failed connection attempts using GSS/SASL and SSPI authentication are reset properly
* Fixes for SSL connection handling and logging
* Fix to allow window functions to be used in sub-SELECT statements that are within the arguments of an aggregate function
* Allow parallelism in the query plan when COPY when copying from a query
* Several fixes to ALTER TABLE
* Fix to ensure that ALTER USER ... SET and ALTER ROLE ... SET accepts the same syntax variants
* Fixes for the statistics collector, ensuring statistics requests made just after a postmaster shutdown request will be written to disk
* Fix possible creation of an invalid WAL segment during standby promotion
* Several walsender / walreceiver fixes, particularly around signal handling and shutdowns / restarts
* Several logic decoding fixes, including removing leakage of small subtransactions to disk
* Allow a CHECK constraints to be initially NOT VALID when executing CREATE FOREIGN TABLE
* Fixes to postgres\_fdw for applying changes promptly after ALTER SERVER / ALTER USER MAPPING commands and improving ability to escape from an unresponsive server
* Several fixes for pg\_dump and pg\_restore, including a fix for pg\_dump output to stdout on Windows
* Fix pg\_basebackup output to stdout on Windows, similar to the fix for pg\_dump
* Fix pg\_rewind to correctly handle files exceeding 2GB, though files of such size should rarely appear in a data directory
* Several fixes for building PostgreSQL with Microsoft Visual C (MSVC), primarily around sourcing libraries

## EOL Warning for Version 9.2

PostgreSQL version 9.2 will be End-of-Life in September, 2017. The project expects to only release one more update for that version. We urge users to start planning an upgrade to a later version of PostgreSQL as soon as possible. See our Versioning Policy for more information.

## Updating

All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use pg\_upgrade in order to apply this update release; you may simply shut down PostgreSQL and update its binaries.
