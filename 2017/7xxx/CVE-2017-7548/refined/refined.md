Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7548:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `lo_put()` function in PostgreSQL did not properly check Access Control Lists (ACLs) before allowing a user to modify a large object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is a lack of proper privilege checks within the `lo_put()` function. This function was intended to enforce the same permissions as `lowrite()`, but a check was missing allowing unauthorized users to modify large objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker, even without specific privileges on a large object, could overwrite the entire content of the object using `lo_put()`. This can result in a denial-of-service condition for applications or users relying on that large object's integrity.
- **Data Integrity:** The ability to overwrite large object contents can lead to data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the PostgreSQL database server but does not need any particular privilege on the large object being modified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to connect to the PostgreSQL server.
- The attacker must have a valid user account (any user, not necessarily with special privileges) on the database instance.
- No special privileges on the targeted large object is needed for the exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects PostgreSQL versions from 9.2 to 9.6.4.
- Patches for this vulnerability are included in versions 9.6.4, 9.5.8, 9.4.13, 9.3.18 and 9.2.22
