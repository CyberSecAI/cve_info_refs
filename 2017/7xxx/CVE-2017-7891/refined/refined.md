The content is related to CVE-2017-7891.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when processing the `rebanid` parameter in the `admin.comms.php` file. The application directly prints the unsanitized user input onto the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially leading to:
- Session hijacking by stealing administrator cookies.
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `rebanid` parameter containing Javascript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript, and then trick a user with administrator privileges to click on the malicious link.
