Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7240:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue present in the embedded web server ("PST10 WebServer") of Miele Professional PG 85 series washer-disinfectors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The web server fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in file paths, allowing an attacker to use special elements such as "../" to navigate outside the intended webroot and access sensitive files on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can read sensitive data and files on the device's file system.
*   **Credential Theft:** By accessing files such as `/etc/shadow` (as shown in the provided exploit), an attacker could obtain password hashes that may be cracked for further access to the system and potentially its software.
*   **Unauthorized access**: Attackers can gain access to machine software and perform unauthorized actions.
*   **System Compromise:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially modify sensitive data, execute unauthorized code or commands, and even cause a system crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network requests to the affected web server.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Miele device or have access to the internal network where the device is located. The vulnerability is not directly accessible from the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to communicate with the affected Miele device on the network.
*   No special skills are required to exploit the vulnerability besides knowledge of the device's IP address and the path traversal technique.
*   The attacker can exploit the vulnerability with low skill level.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered on a Miele PG 8528 model but also affects PG 8527, PG 8535 and PG 8536 models.
*   The affected web server typically listens on port 80.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit demonstrates access to the `/etc/shadow` file using a crafted URL containing `../` sequences.
*  The vulnerability was publicly disclosed after Miele failed to respond to multiple notifications.
*   Miele has released software updates to address the vulnerability and is contacting customers individually.
*   Public exploits for this vulnerability are available.
