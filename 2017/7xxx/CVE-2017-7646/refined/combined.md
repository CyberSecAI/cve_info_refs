# LEM v6.3.1 HOT FIX 4 IS NOW AVAILABLE

[![jhynds](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/cfs-filesystemfile/__key/communityserver-components-imagefileviewer/communityserver-components-avatars-00-00-02-30-09/4UD0M34SO0CC.png_2D00_32x32x2.png?_=637496304615828699)](/members/jhynds)

[over 7 years ago](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/products/security-event-manager-sem/f/forum/33491/lem-v6-3-1-hot-fix-4-is-now-available)

**Download Available:**

<http://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/Release/HotFix/SolarWinds-LEM-v6.3.1-Hotfix4.zip>

**Hotfix 4 addresses the following issues:**

* Multiple vulnerability issues
* Agent-Manager connection timeouts
* Incorrect free disk space values when raw logging is enabled
* Some log connectors running slowly

**To Install Hotfix 4 on the LEM Appliance:**

**1. Using the LEM Console or an SSH client (such as PuTTY), log in to CMC.**

a.  At the cmc> prompt, enter: manager

b.  At the cmc::manager# prompt, enter: hotfix

**2. Follow the instructions on your screen, providing the network path to your Hotfix 4 files and the appropriate credentials with Read access to this path.**

1. 1. a. For example: \\server\share\unzipped\_hotfix\_folder\hotfix
   2. b. If you receive a message stating that no upgrades were found, ensure that you entered the correct path to the files. When completed, a cmc: prompt appears.

**3. Reboot the appliance.**

a.  Exit the cmc::manager# prompt or at the cmc# prompt, enter: appliance

b.  At the prompt, enter: reboot

**To install Hotfix 4 on the LEM Agents**, **u****se one of the following methods:**

1. Use the auto-upgrade feature to automatically upgrade Agents if the feature is enabled.

2. If the auto-upgrade feature is disabled, or if there are communication issues between agents and the LEM Manager, follow the manual installation steps included in the "Install Hotfix 4 on Agents (manual steps)" section of the ReadMe included in the hotfix download.

**Mitigation** **and Upgrades**

To mitigate these issues, SolarWinds recommends upgrading to the latest version of LEM, v6.3.1 & applying Hotfix 4. SolarWinds also recommends [changing the CMC password](https://support.solarwinds.com/Success_Center/Log_Event_Manager_%28LEM%29/Changing_the_CMC_password) to ensure default credentials are not in use.

**Vulnerability Overview**

As of the date of this announcement, SolarWinds is not aware of any instance where a vulnerability remedied in Hotfix 4 has been actively exploited.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers for the vulnerabilities remedied are not available at the time of this announcement, but will be added once assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority.

**Credit Statement**

SolarWinds would like to credit Baker Hamilton at [Bishop Fox](https://www.bishopfox.com/), Matt Bergin & Hank Leininger at [KoreLogic](https://www.korelogic.com/) & [Mehmet Ince](https://www.mehmetince.net/) for reporting these vulnerabilities.

To report a potential vulnerability to SolarWinds, please email PSIRT@solarwinds.com

**Descriptions**

**CMC command injection** – allows an attacker to inject commands to escape the restricted shell.

**Arbitrary command injection** – allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands from the CMC restricted shell - CVE-2017-7647

**Access Control** – allows an authenticated used to browse the LEM server’s filesystem and read contents of arbitrary files - CVE-2017-7646

**Postgres Database Service** – allows hardcoded credentials access to the Postgres database service via IPv6. IPv4 is not affected by this vulnerability.

**Arbitrary File Read** – allows an attacker to edit the SSH logon banner & read arbitrary files.

**Privilege Escalation** – allows an attacker to run certain commands as a privileged user - CVE-2017-5198 & CVE-2017-5199.

**Cumulative Hotfix**

The following fixes from Hotfix 1, Hotfix 2, and Hotfix 3 are also included in this Hotfix:

* Scheduled nDepth search results limited to 50,000 events.
* Fixed ImportCert error when importing certificate after command failure.
* Fixed an issue that display the IP address instead of the FQDN/hostname in 'All Installed Agents'.
* Fixed an issue when an L4 Database appliance started with only 128MB of memory.
* Updates the Java platform to the latest version.
* Fixed an out-of-memory issue that occurs when sending alerts to the console. The fix improves performance when a large number of events are sent to the console.
* Fixed agent-manager communication issues - periodic disconnect and others.
* Fixed an issue with nDepth log retention (logging missing date in raw records).
* Fixed an issue that prevents logging in to LEM if using UserPrincipalName with a custom alias or SAMAccountName with NETBIOS.
* Added the ability to use sub-alias LDAP environments.
* Removed field limitations in the normalized alert database.
* Fixed a log rotate issue that causes connectors to stop working if log lines are too long.
* Fixed a single sign-on SSO issue that occurs if a Kerberos ticket is unusually long because a user belongs to many groups.
* Added the ability to configure custom LDAP groups for authentication.
* Set an agent memory limit for agents upgraded from older versions.
* Fixed other agent-manager communication issues.
* Additional improvements to assist customer support, including improved logging & added diagnostics.
* The threat-feeds server certificate changed - LEM cannot download thread-feeds IPs.
* Unable to use a domain containing a dash in the LDAP configuration.
* Unable to recover a password when HTTP is disabled.
* Exceptions during a fast evaluation are not logged.

**Notes:**

* This fix is applicable to LEM 6.3.1 only

  Hey Jamie, some of the formatting of those cumulative hotfix notes is a little wacky, might be some copy/paste gremlins in there. ![emoticons_wink.png](/resized-image/__size/300x0/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/34/2158.emoticons_5F00_wink.png)
