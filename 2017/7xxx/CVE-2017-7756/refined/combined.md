This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Thunderbird.
Support for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update
we're now following the 52.x releases.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:52.2.1-4~deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:52.2.1-4~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_12\_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.81 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1.Create a malicious BCRYPT.dll file and save it in your "Downloads" directory.
2.Download 'Firefox Setup Stub 53.0.exe' and save it in your "Downloads" directory.
3.Execute 'Firefox Setup Stub 53.0.exe' from your "Downloads" directory.
4.Malicious dll file gets executed.
Actual results:
trojan DLL loads cmd.exe and alert the dialog
Expected results:
DLL file on a Windows computer is placed in the default downloads directory with the Firefox installer, the Firefox installer will load this DLL when it is launched. In circumstances where the installer is run by an administrator privileged account, this allows for the downloaded DLL file to be run with administrator privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code execution from a privileged account.

Thanks for the report. I'm not able to reproduce this using the provided DLL, because we don't load bcrypt.dll in the installer. Normally when we get DLL hijacking issues for DLL's we don't load, it's due to another application injecting them into every process. Since bcrypt.dll is a Windows file, that explanation is less likely, but still possible (a DLL being injected could be loading bcrypt.dll). Reporter, would you mind checking for any applications you might have doing something like that?
Additionally, this only constitutes a privilege elevation if UAC is disabled or can be bypassed, because the downloaded .exe does not try to elevate; it extracts a different one into a temp folder and that one is the one that elevates, so that happens in a separate process.Flags: needinfo?(bogus)

Hello,
I came across this. I also reported that the alert went up when I tried another Windows 10 PC. So I have not examined other dll yet.
I checked it with "Dependency Walker" on my PC, but BCPYCT.DLL has been loaded in several places.
How can I send dwi file?Flags: needinfo?(bogus)

According to "Dependency Walker" in my environment the following dll is also read from the directory where the installer was placed. It is unconfirmed whether exploit is possible
ADVPACK.DLL
APPHELP.DLL
CRYPTSP.DLL
DBGHELP.DLL
DWRITE.DLL
MPR.DLL
MSIMG32.DLL
NETUTILS.DLL
POLICYMANAGER.DLL
SSPICLI.DLL
WINSTA.DLL

Okay, I do see BCRYPT.DLL in Dependency Walker. Looks like it gets pulled in ADVAPI32.DLL. But I don't see it actually get loaded at runtime, which is why the exploit doesn't work. Something is different between our Windows 10 systems that's causing this behavior, and I'm not immediately sure what it could be.

Hello
I also tried dlls other than BCRYPT.DLL but I could not run it.
And on my Windows 8.1 PC, it was not possible to run using BCRYPT.DLL.
However, in my Windows 8.1 PC it was possible to inject with BCRYPTPRIMITIVES.DLL.
In the case of Windows 8.1, it is easy to understand because an error dialog will appear if you place an empty BCRYPTPRIMITIVES.DLL in the same folder as Firefox Setup Stub 53.0.exe (this may be your own environment as well).
Also, other applications like PuTTY seem to have DLL hijacking vulnerability by BCRYPT.DLL.

I hope this will help solve the problem.

I'm attaching a modified installer that I've built. Would you mind checking to see if this installer is still vulnerable? On my machine, it does not attempt to load any modules from anywhere but the system directory, but since we know yours is behaving a bit differently I'd like to get confirmation before I start implementing that fix for real.

I found that the crashreporter.exe also had a vulnerability to load bcrypt.dll as well as the reported vulnerability.
Since it is difficult to put dll in the same directory as crashreporter.exe, I think it is very difficult to attack in practice, but a similar report in the past have been reported([https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=945192](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)")) so I report.

Attached patch

[Patch](attachment.cgi?id=8865037&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8865037&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1361326&attachment=8865037)

This patch makes two changes:
1) Alters the linker settings the 7-zip SFX stub is built with so that only strictly required libraries are linked and all possible DLL's are delay-loaded. kernel32 and msvcrt cannot be delay-loaded, but they are not subject to this vulnerability.
2) Invokes SetDefaultDllDirectories() early at runtime, before any delay-loading occurs, to ensure that DLL's are only loaded from system32 directory, since the SFX stub uses only DLL's which are found there. This applies to our directly required DLL's and also to their dependencies, which are the actual sources of the vulnerabilities here.
The patch also contains a binary rebuilt with those changes, since this binary is kept in-tree rather than compiled at application build-time.

Thanks for pointing this out; to save you the effort, I've filed [bug 1362596](/show_bug.cgi?id=1362596 "NEW - Crash reporter is vulnerable to DLL hijacking on Windows") for getting the crash reporter fixed and indicated there that credit for finding it belongs to you.

Looks good from a code perspective. You might consider using decltype as was done here

I assume this works with Win2K and above so we can provide unsupported messages. If not then you should run this by product to get their buy in.
Kamil has provided testing for these types of changes in the past as you can also see in [bug 945192](/show_bug.cgi?id=945192 "VERIFIED FIXED - The updater.exe loads the bcrypt.dll and other dll's from the working and binary directory when not using the service (Application Update)") and in other bugs.

Couldn't use decltype because VC6 isn't aware of it and wouldn't compile.

I didn't test on Win2k, but I did build it with Visual C++ 6, so it should be working.

I went through three different Win 10 machines and I couldn't reproduce the original issue so there's no way that I can verify that the installer in [comment#6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361326#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking Firefox installer") has fixed the issue. Here's the process that I went through on all three Win 10 machines, please let me know if there's something that I've missed:
\* downloaded the fx53 stub installer [1] and place it into the Downloads folder
\* renamed the stub installer (Firefox Setup Stub 53.0.exe) into installer.exe
\* launched the Process Monitor (Procmon.exe) from the Microsofts Sys Internals Suite and used the following filters
\*\* Process Name - is - installer.exe
\*\* Operation - is - Load Image
\*\* Path - contains - .dll
\* launched the fx53 stub installer (installer.exe) and recorded all the DLL's being loaded
\* segregated all the listed DLL's into Known/Unknown categories using the WinObj.exe tool [2]
\* create an empty file using on of the DLL's names [2] and place it into the Downloads folder alongside installer.exe (fx stub)
\* launch installer.exe
I went through every single DLL that's listed [2] but I couldn't reproduce the issue nor did I receive an error messages of fx attempting to load the DLL from the Downloads folder. I also attempted using the original bcrypt.dll from [comment#0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361326#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking Firefox installer") and the DLL names listed under [comment#3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361326#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking Firefox installer") without any luck.
Matt, let me know if there's something that I've missed or of there's something else that I can try here to see if I can reproduce the original bug.

Load Image events only get generated when an image is successfully loaded, which means they have to be valid DLL's, empty files won't work. Remove the Operation filter and you should start seeing a few CreateFile events for DLL's in the Downloads folder.Flags: needinfo?(mhowell)

(In reply to Matt Howell [:mhowell] from [comment #16](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361326#c16 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking Firefox installer"))

I removed the "Operation - is - Load Image" filter from procmon.exe and went through all the DLLs [1] once again on two different Win 10 x64 machines. None of the DLLs that I created alongside the fx53 stub installer were being loaded from the Downloads folder. However, OLEACCRC.DLL was always attempting to load via the Downloads folder on both machines, example:
\* installer.exe - QueryOpen - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - FAST IO DISALLOWED
\* installer.exe - CreateFile - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - NAME NOT FOUND
Once I created OLEACCRC.DLL inside the Downloads folder and ran the fx53 stub installer, I received the following:
\* QueryOpen - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - FAST IO DISALLOWED
\* CreateFile - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
\* QueryBasicInformationFile - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
\* CloseFile - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
\* IRP\_MJ\_CLOSE - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
\* CreateFile - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
\* CreateFileMapping - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - FILE LOCKED WITH ONLY READERS
\* QueryStandardInformationFile - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
\* FASTIO\_RELEASE\_FOR\_SECTION\_SYNCHRONIZATION - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
\* CloseFile - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
\* IRP\_MJ\_CLOSE - C:\Users\kamil\Downloads\OLEACCRC.DLL - SUCCESS
Using the installer from [comment#6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361326#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking Firefox installer"), I don't see the above behaviour and OLEACCRC.DLL isn't being listed under procmon.exe as being loaded from the Downloads folder.
Matt, as I can't reproduce the issue with the other DLL's [1], is this sufficient verification using OLEACCRC.DLL? I have two more Win 10 machines that I could go through if needed.

It's a little curious that OLEACCRC is the only DLL you're seeing trying to load from that directory, but not curious enough for me to call it a problem, since it does always appear among the ones I see on my machines, and even one DLL is enough to open up the exploit. And everything else that you've described is what I expect to see. I'm calling that verified and requesting sec-approval. Thanks a lot for the help!Flags: needinfo?(mhowell)

Patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
I think you would pretty much have to already be aware of the attack in order to recognize what this patch is doing.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think so, the patch hardly adds any comments and the commit message is deliberately unspecific.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I haven't tried, but I would expect this patch to apply cleanly to all current trees, because of how infrequently this code is touched. I don't see any real risk involved there.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely; it's been manually tested, and the change is too limited to introduce much risk.

I went through the verification process using the STR from [comment#15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361326#c15 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking Firefox installer") and [comment#17](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361326#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking Firefox installer") using the following builds with Win 10 x64 Pro VM:

\* fx54.0b13, buildid: 20170601133324, changeset: cb4a4275b365 - PASSED
Once the fxesr52.2 installer becomes available when we get closer to the release date, I'll go through the same verification process as mentioned above.

Liz, do you know if we have stub installers for esr builds? I took a look at the 52.2.0esr folder [1] but I couldn't find any. Previous versions don't seem to have them either which makes me wonder if stub installers are even created for esr builds. This makes verifying this issue against 52.2.0esr difficult as we need a stub installer as per the original STR form [comment#0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1361326#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - DLL Hijacking Firefox installer").

The full installer should also be vulnerable; I haven't tested it specifically, but the patched code is used in both installers.

#### [#CVE-2017-7760: File manipulation and privilege escalation via callback parameter in Mozilla Windows Updater and Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7760)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

#### [#CVE-2017-7765: Mark of the Web bypass when saving executable files](#CVE-2017-7765)

Reporter
Jonathan Birch and Microsoft Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7766: File execution and privilege escalation through updater.ini, Mozilla Windows Updater, and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7766)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

An attack using manipulation of `updater.ini` contents, used by the Mozilla Windows Updater, and privilege escalation through the Mozilla Maintenance Service to allow for arbitrary file execution and deletion by the Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7767: Privilege escalation and arbitrary file overwrites through Mozilla Windows Updater and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7767)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to overwrite arbitrary files with junk data using the Mozilla Windows Updater, which runs with the Maintenance Service's privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7768: 32 byte arbitrary file read through Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7768)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

I was unable to reproduce the crash on various presumably affected asan builds using the test case from [Comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1366595#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stack-use-after-scope in NS_strlen while logging errors in XHR"), with and without the fuzzPriv extension, on Ubuntu 16.04 x64. Here's what I've used:
\* 55.0a1 linux64-asan from 2017-04-10 (20170410233251)
\* 55.0a1 linux64-asan from 2017-05-09 (20170509120348)
\* 55.0a1 linux64-asan from 2017-05-21 (20170521163721)
Since I couldn't reproduce the crash, I can't confirm if this is fixed or not.
Abhishek Arya, could you please verify this on the latest asan builds of 54.0b [1], 55.0a1 [2] and 52.2.0esr [3]?

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1348645](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1348645)

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7762: Addressbar spoofing in Reader mode](#CVE-2017-7762)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

* [Bug 1358248](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358248)

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

#### [#CVE-2017-7765: Mark of the Web bypass when saving executable files](#CVE-2017-7765)

Reporter
Jonathan Birch and Microsoft Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7766: File execution and privilege escalation through updater.ini, Mozilla Windows Updater, and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7766)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

An attack using manipulation of `updater.ini` contents, used by the Mozilla Windows Updater, and privilege escalation through the Mozilla Maintenance Service to allow for arbitrary file execution and deletion by the Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Byron Campen, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Benjamin Bouvier, Bob Clary, Jon Coppeard, and Michael Layzell reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

                 CVE-2017-7776 CVE-2017-7777 CVE-2017-7778

Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer overflows
and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code, denial of service or domain spoofing.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 52.x releases.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Attached file
[testcase.html](attachment.cgi?id=8858813)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8858813&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/57.0.2987.133 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Tested on:
- Mozilla Firefox 52.0.2 (32-bit) on Windows 10
- Nightly 55.0a1 (2017-04-10) (64-bit) on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Details:
dom/canvas/WebGLTexture.h:
..
313 ImageInfo& ImageInfoAtFace(uint8\_t face, uint32\_t level) {
314 MOZ\_ASSERT(face < mFaceCount);
315 MOZ\_ASSERT(level < kMaxLevelCount);
316 size\_t pos = (level \* mFaceCount) + face;
317 return mImageInfoArr[pos];
318 }
..
By supplying a sufficiently large value to 'level' (see the third parameter of gl.texParameterf() in the provided testcase file), it is possible to cause an out-of-bounds array access in line 317. This may result in a bogus ImageInfo object being returned to the calling function, possibly leading to an exploitable state.

Note that the attached testcase doesn't always crash instantaneously for me. Took a few seconds sometimes.

[GDB backtrace of ImageInfoAtFace()](attachment.cgi?id=8861383)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8861383&action=edit)

I took a look at this bug, and maybe have some relevant information.
First off, attached is my gdb backtrace when hitting the function ImageInfoAtFace() which triggered immediately after I continued the execution with gdb once I set the breakpoint.
From what I can tell is that |mBaseMipmapLevel| holds the value of |level| passed to the quoted function by the reporter.
Further
> gl.texParameterf(gl.TEXTURE\_CUBE\_MAP, gl.TEXTURE\_BASE\_LEVEL, 0x50);
in the testcase seems to set that member variable here [1]
The vulnerable function seems to be triggered by calling
> gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 1);
in the testcase.
In my debug build (the one I used for debugging), the MOZ\_ASSERTS, are present [2] and would cause a crash.
However since those are not MOZ\_RELEASE\_ASSERT, the reporter probably didn't hit them with his testcase.
As a side note, there are different code path that validate |mBaseMipmapLevel| to be less than |kMaxLevelCount| which in my build is 31. However in this particular code path (shown in my gdb backtrace and in the reporters windbg output) |mBaseMipmapLevel| is not validated, thus leading to the out-of-bound array access.
Also, I would consider increasing the security rating, because the object read by the out-of-bound is of the class ImageInfo [3].
Given that |mBaseMipmapLevel| is of type uint32\_t [4], the accessible memory range is pretty big (on 64 bit, and the entire memory range on 32 bit) so crafting a malicious ImageInfo object and let it be accessed by this out-of-bounds shouldn't be too hard.

I prefer to use "if (mBaseMipmapLevel >= kMaxLevelCount)", this also follows the same style here, <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ebbcdaa5b5802ecd39624dd2acbdda8547b8384d/dom/canvas/WebGLTexture.h#342>

I'm giving this sec-approval for checkin into trunk on May 22 (not earlier).
The Aurora flag doesn't matter as Aurora doesn't exist anymore so I'll clear that.
