  "CVE-2017-7807": {
    "description": "A mechanism that uses AppCache to hijack a URL in a domain using fallback by serving the files from a sub-path on the domain. This has been addressed by requiring fallback files be inside the manifest directory.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the AppCache mechanism allowing a fallback URL to be set from a sub-path of a domain, which can be used to hijack URLs within the entire domain if the attacker can inject a malicious manifest.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure AppCache fallback mechanism",
      "Lack of proper URL validation for fallback paths"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can potentially hijack URLs on a domain and serve malicious content from a subpath of the domain using a crafted AppCache manifest, leading to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Injecting a malicious AppCache manifest in a domain",
      "Serving the manifest from a subpath of the targeted domain"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious appcache manifest file at a location reachable by the victim's browser. They must be able to trick a user to visit a page that references that malicious manifest.",
      "Additional Details": "The fix restricts fallback resources to be inside the manifest directory, resolving the issue."
