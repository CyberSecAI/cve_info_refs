{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `dm_bp_transition` docbase method in OpenText Documentum Content Server does not properly validate user input, allowing arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation in the `dm_bp_transition` docbase method allows execution of arbitrary code.",
      "The application fetches and executes a user-provided script without sufficient validation.",
       "The vulnerability is exploitable even after vendor attempts to patch by SQL injection.",
       "Insufficient input sanitization which can be bypassed by using whitespace characters."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with superuser privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can create a malicious basic procedure in the repository.",
      "The attacker can pass the procedure's identifier as an argument to the vulnerable `dm_bp_transition` method.",
      "SQL injection can be used to bypass checks on the object type of the provided ID.",
      "Using alternative whitespace characters to bypass keyword checks."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have access to create objects in the Documentum repository. A low privileged user can exploit this."
