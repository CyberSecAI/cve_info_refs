{
  "CVE-2017-7922": {
    "Root cause": "The privileges for SNMP community strings are not properly restricted.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker may gain access to sensitive information and possibly make unauthorized configuration changes.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based exploitation via SNMP.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the network and have knowledge of the SNMP community strings to exploit the vulnerability. Exploitation does not require user interaction but does require valid credentials (low privileged)",
     "Additional Details": "The default SNMP community strings ('public' and 'private' for read-only and read-write respectively) are commonly known and if not changed, facilitate exploitation.  The advisory recommends changing these to a strong, random string of at least 8 characters. Additionally, the advisory notes that exploits for this vulnerability are publicly available."
