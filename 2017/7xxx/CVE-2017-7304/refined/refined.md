The provided content is related to CVE-2017-7304.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an invalid `sh_link` field in an ELF file's section header. The `strip` utility attempts to follow this invalid link without proper validation, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Invalid pointer dereference
- Lack of input validation in `copy_special_section_fields` function within `elf.c`. Specifically, the code does not check if the `sh_link` field in the section header is a valid index before dereferencing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The `strip` utility crashes when processing a crafted ELF file, causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted ELF file: An attacker can create an ELF file with an invalid `sh_link` field in a section header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted ELF file as input to the `strip` utility.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in `binutils` version 2.28 and possibly earlier versions.
- The vulnerability was triggered by a fuzzer (AFLFast).
- The vulnerability was addressed in commit `4f3ca05b487e9755018b4c9a053a2e6c35d8a7df` which introduced a check for invalid `sh_link` field before dereferencing.
- The crash occurs within the `copy_special_section_fields` function, when trying to find the link (`sh_link`).
- The `copy_special_section_fields` function is called by `_bfd_elf_copy_private_bfd_data`, `copy_object` and `copy_file` functions.
