{
  "CVE-2017-7782": {
    "Description": "An error in the `WindowsDllDetourPatcher` where a RWX (\"Read/Write/Execute\") 4k block is allocated but never protected, violating DEP protections.",
    "Root cause": "The `WindowsDllDetourPatcher` allocates a 4k block with RWX permissions, but never changes the permissions to make it W^X compliant.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The allocated memory region is not protected by DEP (Data Execution Prevention).",
      "RWX memory is allocated which allows code execution from the memory page."
    ],
    "Impact": "Bypassing DEP protection which can be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of an attacker controlled process with another vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious code could repurpose the memory page to store and execute shellcode.",
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Malicious code needs to find another vulnerability to leverage this vulnerability."
  }
}
