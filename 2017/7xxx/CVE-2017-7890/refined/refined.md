  "CVE-2017-7890": {
    "related_to_cve": true,
    "description": "The GIF decoding function `gdImageCreateFromGifCtx` in `gd_gif_in.c` in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd), as used in PHP before 5.6.31 and 7.x before 7.1.7, does not zero colorMap arrays before use. A specially crafted GIF image could use the uninitialized tables to read ~700 bytes from the top of the stack, potentially disclosing sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `gdImageCreateFromGifCtx` function of the GD Graphics Library due to the failure to zero color map arrays before use.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "buffer over-read",
      "information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can potentially disclose sensitive information from the server's stack memory by supplying a specially crafted GIF image.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Supplying a malicious GIF file"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted GIF to the vulnerable application."
