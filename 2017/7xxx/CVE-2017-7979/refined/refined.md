Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7979:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Linux kernel's traffic control (tc) subsystem handles user-provided "cookies" when initializing actions. Specifically, commit `1045ba77a` introduced code in `net/sched/act_api.c`'s `tcf_action_init_1` function that unconditionally parsed a nested attribute array (`tb`) for cookie data, even when a different parsing method was intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Attribute Parsing:** The code unconditionally uses `nla_parse_nested` with `TCA_ACT_MAX` enum, which is intended for the case when `name == NULL`, but in other cases, the attributes are passed to `->init` for parsing using other `TCA_*` enums. This leads to a clash of `TCA_ACT_COOKIE` enum values.
*   **Memory Corruption:**  When the `tc filter add` command fails due to the parsing issue, the `cklen` variable could become negative. Although the size check `TC_COOKIE_MAX_SIZE` passes due to `cklen` being signed and the check being with signed value, it later becomes unsigned in `kmemdup()`, leading to potential memory corruption during memory allocation.
*   **Refcount underflow:** There is a potential refcount underflow, possibly due to incorrect handling of memory allocation.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The memory corruption can ultimately lead to kernel crashes, including NULL pointer dereferences in `__free_pages`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows a local attacker to trigger kernel crashes and system hangs through specific `tc` commands, effectively causing a DoS.
*   **Kernel Panic:** Exploitation leads to kernel panics and system crashes.
*   **System Instability:** The system becomes unstable after triggering the vulnerability, leading to various errors such as general protection faults, and seemingly unrelated crash dumps.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by executing specific `tc` commands on the local system.
*   **Unprivileged Users:** The provided examples show it can be triggered from within an unprivileged LXD container, increasing the attack surface.
*   **Network Configuration:** The commands are related to configuring network traffic control, which is a common task.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **Ability to run `tc`:** The attacker must be able to execute `tc` commands.
*   **No special privileges needed:** The issue can be triggered from within an unprivileged LXD container, highlighting that root access or other elevated privileges are not necessary.

**Additional details:**

* The issue is triggered when adding a basic traffic control filter with specific rate limiting.
* The vulnerability was introduced in commit `1045ba77a`.
* The issue was reproducible on multiple kernel versions including Ubuntu's Zesty kernel.
* The fix involves allocating action cookies earlier, and marking `nla_memdup_cookie()` static.
