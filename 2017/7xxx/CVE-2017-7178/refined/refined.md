{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Deluge web UI plugin does not properly check for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) when handling requests to the `/json` endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSRF vulnerability in the web UI plugin. Specifically, requests made to the `/json` endpoint are not checked for CSRF.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a logged-in user into sending forged requests to the Deluge web UI. This can allow the attacker to make Deluge download and install a malicious plugin, leading to remote code execution with the privileges of the user running Deluge.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious web page can send forged requests to the Deluge web UI via the `/json` endpoint, exploiting the lack of CSRF protection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in Deluge web UI user into visiting a malicious web page. The attacker also needs to provide a malicious Deluge plugin for the victim to install."
