## Summary

**Name:** WSP dissector infinite loop

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2017-21

## Details

### Description

The WSP dissector could go into an infinite loop.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark

someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 2.2.6, 2.0.12 or later.
