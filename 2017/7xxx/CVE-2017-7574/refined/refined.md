- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded encryption key in SoMachine Basic's Project Protection feature. This feature is intended to prevent unauthorized access to project files by encrypting them with a user-defined password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the hardcoded key used for AES-CBC encryption. This allows anyone with access to this key to decrypt the project XML file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully decrypts the project file gains access to the user-defined project password, enabling them to open and modify the project using SoMachine Basic.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious user gaining access to a protected SoMachine Basic project file and exploiting the hardcoded key to decrypt it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs access to a protected project file and knowledge of the hardcoded encryption key.
