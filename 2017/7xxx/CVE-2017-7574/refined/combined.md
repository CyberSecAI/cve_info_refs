Security Notification – SoMachine Basic - Version B

16-June-2017

Overview

Schneider Electric has become aware of research and a vulnerability identified against
SoMachine Basic software that exposes a weakness in the encryption used to protect
SoMachine Basic project files.

Vulnerability Overview

The Project Protection feature, which prompts the user for a password, is intended to prevent
unauthorized users from opening the protected project file.  AES-CBC encryption is used on the
project XML file, however the key used to encrypt the file is hardcoded and cannot be changed.

A malicious user able to decrypt the XML file can then gain access to the user defined project
password visible within the decrypted data.  After reading the user password, the project can be
opened and modified with SoMachine Basic.

Overall CVSS Score: 10 (Critical)

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L
