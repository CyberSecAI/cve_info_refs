Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7519:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a format string flaw in the `libradosstriper` library. This library improperly parses user input, treating it as format string specifiers intended for `printf` family functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `libradosstriper` library processes arbitrary `printf` placeholders present in user-provided input, leading to a format string vulnerability. This allows attackers to control the format string passed to `printf` or similar functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting crafted format string specifiers, an attacker could cause the application using `libradosstriper` to crash or terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing untrusted input containing format string specifiers. This input could come from various sources, depending on how the application uses `libradosstriper`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is processed by the vulnerable `libradosstriper` library and that contains format string specifiers.

**Additional details:**
- Red Hat states this issue did not affect the versions of ceph as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3 and 2 as they did not ship libradosstriper.
- The upstream tracker for this issue is  <http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/20240>

In summary, CVE-2017-7519 is a format string vulnerability in `libradosstriper` that can be exploited by providing crafted input containing `printf` placeholders, leading to a denial-of-service.
