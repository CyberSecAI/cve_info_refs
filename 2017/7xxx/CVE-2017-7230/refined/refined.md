{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the handling of GET requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when handling a GET request, specifically when processing the URI path.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the target system. The provided exploit uses this to establish a reverse shell, granting the attacker control over the vulnerable machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request with an overly long URI to the vulnerable service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service on port 80. No prior authentication is needed."
