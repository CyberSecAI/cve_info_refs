Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The provided information indicates the presence of multiple vulnerabilities in ImageWorsener, including CVE-2017-7940, but does not provide a root cause specific to CVE-2017-7940. The github issue #18 does, however, describe a memory leak related to GIF processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201706-06) states that there are "multiple vulnerabilities" in ImageWorsener.
- The advisory lists CVE-2017-7940 as one of these vulnerabilities.
- The github issue #18 describes a memory leak in `imagew-cmd` when processing certain GIF files. It traces the leak to a specific allocation within the `iwgif_read_image` function and related functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The Gentoo advisory states that a remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition or have other unspecified impacts by enticing a user to process a specially crafted image file.
- The github issue #18 describes a direct memory leak, indicating a potential for a denial of service if the leak is triggered repeatedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves enticing a user to process a specially crafted image file (likely a GIF based on the github issue) using ImageWorsener.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver this crafted file to the user, such as via email, a web page or other mechanism.

- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a crafted image file to the victim.
- The user then needs to process the crafted file with the vulnerable version of `imageworsener`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The github issue #18 provides more specific details about a memory leak in GIF processing that may be related to the CVE-2017-7940.
- The Gentoo advisory indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The issue was fixed in ImageWorsener version 1.3.1.
