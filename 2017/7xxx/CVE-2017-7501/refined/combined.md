This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Don't follow symlinks on file creation ([CVE-2017-7501](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3xgr-x5gv-64gh "CVE-2017-7501"))

```
Open newly created files with O_EXCL to prevent symlink tricks.
When reopening hardlinks for writing the actual content, use append
mode instead. This is compatible with the write-only permissions but
is not destructive in case we got redirected to somebody elses file,
verify the target before actually writing anything.

As these are files with the temporary suffix, errors mean a local
user with sufficient privileges to break the installation of the package
anyway is trying to goof us on purpose, don't bother trying to mend it
(we couldn't fix the hardlink case anyhow) but just bail out.

Based on a patch by Florian Festi.

# RPM: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201811-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in RPM, the worst of which
could allow a remote attacker to escalate privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/rpm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.14.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.14.1** |

### Background

The Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package
management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying,
querying, and updating computer software packages.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in RPM. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing the user to process a specially crafted
RPM file, could escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code, or cause a
Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All RPM users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/rpm-4.14.1"

```

## Description

It was found that versions of rpm before 4.13.0.2 use temporary files with predictable names when installing an RPM. An attacker with ability to write in a directory where files will be installed could create symbolic links to an arbitrary location and modify content, and possibly permissions to arbitrary files, which could be used for denial of service or possibly privilege escalation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
