Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of predictable temporary file names during the installation of RPM packages. Specifically, the `rpm` tool creates temporary files with predictable names when writing the content of a file in the package being installed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The software uses predictable names for temporary files created during the installation process, making it easier for an attacker to anticipate the file path.
- **Symlink Following:** Before the fix, the code does not verify if the destination is a symlink. It just opens it and tries to write content there.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Modification:** An attacker can exploit this weakness to create symbolic links with the same name as the temporary files in locations where the `rpm` tool is trying to write. When `rpm` creates the temporary file, it will be created at the path pointed to by the symlink. This allows an attacker to potentially modify the content of arbitrary files on the system by redirecting the output of `rpm` to a file of their choice.
- **Arbitrary Permission Changes:** By creating carefully crafted symbolic links, an attacker could potentially modify the permissions of arbitrary files.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The ability to modify file content and permissions can lead to a denial of service by corrupting critical system files, making the system unusable or unstable.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying critical system files, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges to root or other privileged accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system and the ability to write to the directory where the package will be installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user who has the privilege to write in the directory where the target file will be installed by `rpm`.
- **Timing:**  The attacker needs to time the creation of the symlink before rpm attempts to write to the temporary file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is fixed by ensuring the creation of new files use the `O_EXCL` flag, which fails if the file already exists. The patch also modifies the way it reopens files for writing the content, using `a` (append mode) instead of `w` (write mode). Additionally, the code now verifies the target file is what it expects before writing anything.
- The fix includes a check of the target file using `linkSane`.
- The provided commit message describes the fix as "Don't follow symlinks on file creation."
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201811-22) also references this CVE, indicating the vulnerability is exploitable remotely by enticing a user to process a malicious RPM file. This might suggest other attack vectors, even though the GitHub advisory says the attack vector is local.
- The GitHub advisory indicates that this vulnerability exists in versions of `rpm` prior to 4.13.0.2. The Gentoo advisory indicates that it affects versions before 4.14.1. The commit identified as a fix is from 2017, predating both of these numbers.
