Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The BGP dissector in Wireshark contains a flaw that can lead to an infinite loop when processing certain malformed BGP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An infinite loop in the BGP dissector. This is due to a flaw in how the dissector handles specific malformed BGP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. This can occur whether Wireshark is dissecting live network traffic or processing a malformed packet capture file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a specially crafted malformed BGP packet onto the network. If a user is using Wireshark to capture and analyze this traffic, the vulnerability can be triggered.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can create a malicious packet trace file (.pcap) containing the crafted BGP packet, and entice a user to open it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject network traffic or provide a malicious packet capture file to a user running a vulnerable version of Wireshark.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network, they could send the packet or file over the internet, so long as it eventually gets processed by a vulnerable Wireshark installation.
