  "CVE-2017-7308": {
    "description": "The packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6 does not properly validate certain block-size data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer signedness error and out-of-bounds write), or gain privileges (if the CAP_NET_RAW capability is held), via crafted system calls.",
    "root_cause": "Integer signedness error in the validation of block-size data within the packet_set_ring function. The check `(int)(req->tp_block_size - BLK_PLUS_PRIV(req_u->req3.tp_sizeof_priv)) <= 0` allows bypassing if `tp_sizeof_priv` is crafted to cause a signed integer overflow when subtracted from `tp_block_size`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer signedness error",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash), or gain privileges if the attacker has the CAP_NET_RAW capability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation using crafted system calls to AF_PACKET socket interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with CAP_NET_RAW capability or the ability to create such a socket in a user namespace (if unprivileged user namespaces are enabled)."
