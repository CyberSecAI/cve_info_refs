Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a divide-by-zero error in the `iwgif_record_pixel` function within the `imagew-gif.c` file of the ImageWorsener library. This occurs during the processing of specially crafted GIF images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Divide-by-Zero:** The core vulnerability is a division operation where the divisor can be zero, leading to a floating-point exception (FPE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the application due to the FPE, causing a denial of service. 
- **Unspecified Impact:**  The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions "other unspecified impact", which could indicate potential for further exploitation depending on the context and environment, though no specific details are given in the provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious GIF Image:** The primary attack vector is the processing of a specially crafted GIF image by the ImageWorsener tool or library. This image is designed to trigger the divide-by-zero condition.
- **Remote Attacker:** A remote attacker could entice a user to process such a malicious GIF file to cause a DoS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide/trick a user into opening a malicious GIF image:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a GIF file to the victim such that the victim will process it with the vulnerable software.
- **No specific position required:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing the file, not by any network interaction.

**Additional details:**

- The issue was discovered using a fuzzer (American Fuzzy Lop)
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.1 of ImageWorsener.
- The problematic code is located within the `iwgif_record_pixel` function of `src/imagew-gif.c`

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-7962 is a divide-by-zero vulnerability in the ImageWorsener library's GIF decoding functionality. By providing a malicious GIF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service. The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.3.1.
