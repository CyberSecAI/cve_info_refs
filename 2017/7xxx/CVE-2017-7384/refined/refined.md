Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `ExternalInterface.call` function within the `flippdf` software. This function is used to execute JavaScript code by calling the `eval` function on `window.location.href`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The software uses the value of the `currentHTMLURL` parameter without proper sanitization or encoding. Specifically, it attempts to retrieve the `currentHTMLURL` parameter and if that fails, it gets the `window.location.href` and passes that to the `eval` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code by crafting a malicious URL using the `currentHTMLURL` parameter, leading to XSS when the SWF file is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable website.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This could allow an attacker to perform actions like:
    *   Cookie hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to phishing sites
    *   Compromising user accounts
    *   Injecting malware through drive-by-exploits

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that include a malicious payload within the `currentHTMLURL` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks on a link containing the malicious URL and then scrolls to the next page of the flipbook.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the XSS vulnerability in the `flippdf` software.
*   **Ability to Create Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious JavaScript payload encoded in the `currentHTMLURL` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering (Likely):** The attacker would typically need to entice a user to click the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the `bookContent.swf` file which is part of the flippdf software used to convert pdf files to flash/html5 for online magazines/brochures/ebooks
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the user navigates to the next page of the flipbook.
*   The vulnerability affects thousands of websites, including government sites, universities, banks, military sites, and major companies.
*   The researcher reported the vulnerability to the software vendor, but it was not fixed.
*   The vulnerability is similar to the `flashmediaelement.swf` XSS vulnerability (CVE-2016-4566).
*   Google dorking was used to find vulnerable instances of the software.
