Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7991:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the `api` function of the `eaasController.php` file in Exponent CMS. The application improperly handles user-supplied input in the `apikey` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection. The application takes the `apikey` parameter, which is base64 encoded and URL decoded, and then unserializes it via the `expUnserialize` function, without proper sanitization or input validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to potentially read or modify database information, which can lead to sensitive data exposure.
*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, leading to various impacts such as data modification, deletion, or privilege escalation.
*   **Denial of Service:** As demonstrated in the proof of concept, injecting a `sleep()` command can cause the server to become unresponsive, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to `index.php` with the `module=eaas`, `action=api`, and the crafted, base64 encoded, and serialized SQL injection string within the `apikey` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication or privileged access.
*   **Knowledge of URL structure:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of the vulnerable URLs, specifically the `module`, `action`, and `apikey` parameters.
*   **Ability to encode and serialize data:** The attacker has to base64 encode and serialize the malicious SQL string.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Exponent CMS version 2.4.1 and earlier.
*   The vulnerable file is `/framework/modules/eaas/controllers/eaasController.php`.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) URL is provided: `http://localhost:88/exponent/index.php?module=eaas&action=api&apikey=czoxNjoiYWFhJ29yIHNsZWVwKDIpIyI7`
    *   This PoC shows an example where the attacker injects `aaa'or sleep(2)#` to cause the site to sleep.
*   The fix for the vulnerability was implemented by adding the line `preg_match('/[^a-zA-Z\_][^a-zA-Z0-9\_]\*/', $key, $matches);` and `$key = $matches[0];` which uses a regular expression to filter the input.
