{
  "cve": "CVE-2017-7493",
  "description": "Improper access control issues in the host directory sharing via 9pfs support in QEMU could allow a guest user to escalate their privileges inside the guest when using the mapped-file security mode.",
  "affected_component": "QEMU's 9pfs (Plan 9 File System) implementation, specifically when using the 'mapped-file' security mode.",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control when handling metadata in the 'mapped-file' security mode of QEMU's 9pfs implementation. The code attempts to hide the metadata directory from the client, but it fails to prevent access or modification of it through other operations.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper access control",
    "Insecure handling of metadata files",
    "Privilege escalation due to unrestricted access to metadata."
  ],
   "impact": "A malicious guest user can leverage this flaw to escalate their privileges within the guest operating system, potentially gaining root access or other administrative rights.",
   "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves a malicious guest user attempting to access or modify the metadata files through various 9pfs operations.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user with access to the guest operating system.",
  "affected_operations": [
    "local_mknod()",
    "local_mkdir()",
    "local_open2()",
    "local_symlink()",
    "local_link()",
    "local_unlinkat()",
    "local_renameat()",
    "local_rename()",
    "local_name_to_path()"
  ],
   "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the code fails to properly restrict access to the metadata directory, which can be manipulated by the guest user via multiple operations. The fix involves making the above listed functions return EINVAL when the path corresponds to the metadata directory."
