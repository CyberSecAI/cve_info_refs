Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a combination of factors:

*   **Default Credentials:** The SolarWinds Log & Event Manager (LEM) appliance ships with a default password for the `cmc` user via SSH, and this password is not changed during initial web interface configuration, leaving it vulnerable.
*   **Restricted Shell Escape:** The restricted shell provided via SSH contains a command injection vulnerability within the `restrictssh` command. This command takes user-supplied input and uses it to modify the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file without proper sanitization.
*   **Outdated Kernel:** The underlying Linux kernel is old and vulnerable to known privilege escalation exploits, specifically `dirtyc0w`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Default Password Vulnerability:** The use of default credentials for the cmc user via SSH.
*   **Command Injection:** A command injection vulnerability in the `restrictssh` command within the restricted shell, allowing the injection of arbitrary commands into the ssh configuration file.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An outdated Linux kernel is susceptible to local privilege escalation vulnerabilities like `dirtyc0w`.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `restrictssh` command does not sanitize user input, leading to the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Shell Access:** An attacker can escape the restricted `cmc` shell and obtain a full shell.
*   **Root Access:** With a full shell, an attacker can exploit the outdated kernel to gain root access.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker achieves complete control of the SolarWinds LEM appliance.
*   **Data Breach:** With root access, an attacker can access sensitive data, including system logs and possibly credentials used by the system.
*   **Data Manipulation/Loss:** An attacker with root access can alter system logs, configuration, and other data, causing data loss or manipulating security events.
*   **Lateral Movement:** This can allow an attacker to move laterally into the network.
*   **Credential Theft:** The attacker can capture admin login credentials in plain text from network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the LEM appliance to connect via SSH.
*   **SSH:** The initial attack vector is via SSH, using the default password of the `cmc` user.
*   **Restricted Shell:** The command injection is done through the restricted `cmc` shell by exploiting the `restrictssh` command.
*   **Local Exploit:** The root privilege escalation is achieved by using a known local exploit (`dirtyc0w`) for the outdated kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the SolarWinds LEM appliance.
*   **SSH Client:** The attacker needs a tool to connect via SSH.
*   **Default Credentials:** The attacker requires knowledge of the default password for the `cmc` user via SSH, which is publicly available.
*   **Knowledge of Command Injection:** The attacker needs the knowledge to inject commands into the `restrictssh` feature.
*   **Exploit:**  The attacker needs knowledge and access to an exploit for the `dirtyc0w` vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The article also mentions that the vendor released a hotfix to address the issues described and credits the researchers for discovering the vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker is able to capture clear text credentials for the web interface after obtaining root access. This is done by sniffing network traffic, invalidating existing user sessions by restarting the service, and then analyzing the AMF encoded traffic.
