Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **incorrect default permissions** assigned to a directory and files created during the installation of Schneider Electric's Wonderware InduSoft Web Studio. Specifically, the installer creates `C:\Bin\x86\` and two files within it. These are added to the system's PATH.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File/Directory Permissions:** The newly created directory and files located in `C:\Bin\x86\` have permissions that allow manipulation by non-administrator users.
*   **PATH Inclusion:** Because this directory and its files are included in the system's PATH, non-admin users can modify or replace the files with malicious ones, creating a privilege escalation vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an authenticated user with non-administrator privileges can escalate their privileges to that of a higher-level user/administrator. This is achieved by writing malicious files/DLLs to the affected directory, which will be executed by the system.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. The attacker needs to have an account on the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid user credentials for an account on the target system, but does not need administrator level permissions.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions).
*   The CVSS v3 base score assigned is 7.3 (High) according to ICS-CERT, however, Schneider Electric gives a higher CVSS v3 score of 8.4.
*   The vulnerability affects Wonderware InduSoft Web Studio v8.0 Patch 3 and prior versions.
*   The fix is available in Wonderware InduSoft Web Studio v8.0 + Service Pack 1 and newer versions.
*   There is no known public exploit specifically targeting this vulnerability.
