{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A recursive call between two functions in pdfunite leads to stack exhaustion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uncontrolled recursion leading to stack exhaustion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to program crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted PDF file that triggers the recursive calls.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF file as input to the pdfunite utility."
