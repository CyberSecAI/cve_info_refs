Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability arises from insufficient checks within Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird's Phishing and Malware Protection feature. Specifically, file downloads initiated using `blob:` and `data:` URLs bypassed the usual security checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Bypassed Security Checks:** The core weakness is the failure to properly apply the phishing and malware protection mechanisms to downloads triggered via `blob:` and `data:` URLs. The application reputation checks that were implemented were not properly processing these unusual URL schemes, specifically skipping the nsIURL interface verification.
*   **Unprotected File Downloads:** This created a situation where malicious files could be downloaded without triggering the intended warnings or blocks.
*   **Missing URL Normalization:** The processing of `data:` URLs lacked proper handling/normalization which allowed it to bypass protections. 

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malware Infection:** Attackers could use this to trick users into downloading and executing malicious files, potentially leading to system compromise.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could use this to redirect users to spoofed websites, leading to credentials compromise or other forms of phishing.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** A remote attacker could create a malicious web page containing the malicious `blob:` or `data:` URL download links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need to be present on the local network and can operate remotely through an internet-accessible web server.
*   **Web Server Hosting:** The attacker needs a web server or hosting platform to serve the malicious webpage.
*  **Social Engineering:** The attacker requires a method of luring a user to the malicious link.

**Additional Details from Content:**
*   **Mozilla Bugzilla:**  Bug 1376036 was filed by francois, with a fix ultimately being targeted for Firefox 56.
*   **Red Hat Advisories:** Red Hat identified the issue as CVE-2017-7814 and included it in security advisories RHSA-2017:2831 (Firefox) and RHSA-2017:2885 (Thunderbird).
*  **Debian Security Advisories:** DSA 3987-1 and DSA 4014-1 contain the fix for this vulnerability in Firefox and Thunderbird respectively.
* **Chrome Comparison:** The content notes that Chrome also processes `blob:` and `data:` URLs, and that this was taken into account when developing the fix.
*   **Patch Details:** The patch involved modifying `ApplicationReputation.cpp` to correctly process `blob:` and `data:` URLs by implementing proper origin checks and hashing of the content before submitting to remote lookup.
*   **Use-After-Free:** It is important to note that this vulnerability was one of several security fixes included in Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2017-22 and 2017-23, including a number of use-after-free issues. CVE-2017-7814 was addressed alongside use-after-free bugs, a buffer overflow, and other security issues in the same security advisories.

In summary, CVE-2017-7814 highlights a bypass vulnerability in download protection, allowing malicious file downloads via unconventional URLs. The fix addressed the lack of appropriate URL scheme processing and ensured proper application of security checks for such downloads.
