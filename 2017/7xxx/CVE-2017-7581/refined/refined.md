Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the TYPO3 News module. The module allows users to filter news based on various criteria. The vulnerability arises because user-controlled input is used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `order` parameter, used in the `ORDER BY` clause, is vulnerable when the `overrideDemand` setting is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `order` parameter, used in the SQL `ORDER BY` clause, is directly derived from user input without sufficient validation when the `overrideDemand` is set to `1`. The `orderByAllowed` parameter which is meant to whitelist allowed values for the `order` parameter can be overridden by sending `OrderByAllowed` instead to bypass the unset filter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract usernames and password hashes of backend users from the `be_users` table.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Successful exploitation can lead to further attacks, such as privilege escalation, modification of data and potentially complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted POST requests to the TYPO3 News module endpoint. Specifically, the `tx_news_pi1[overwriteDemand][order]` and `tx_news_pi1[overwriteDemand][OrderByAllowed]` POST parameters are used to inject SQL code into the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the TYPO3 website to send malicious POST requests.
- **Knowledge of the Target:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable TYPO3 installation and its News module endpoint.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to construct malicious SQL injection payloads.
- **Understanding of application logic:** The attacker needs to understand the application logic to bypass restrictions like the filter on parameters.
- **Bypass WAF Filters:** The attacker needs to understand WAF rules to bypass restrictions regarding spaces, commas and comments.

**Additional Details:**
- The `overrideDemand` setting must be set to `1` (which is the default) for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
- The article provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, how to bypass filters, and a working proof-of-concept exploit.
- It mentions how `orderByAllowed` is normally filtered, but can be bypassed using `OrderByAllowed`.
- It describes using a time based blind SQL injection by altering the order of the results with the `ORDER BY` clause.
- The exploit uses a blind SQL injection to extract the username and password.
- The article also notes that the vulnerability is still exploitable on TYPO3 6.x by using the `dateField` parameter instead of `OrderByAllowed`.
