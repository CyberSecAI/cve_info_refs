  "CVE-2017-7481": {
    "description": "An input validation flaw was found in Ansible, where it fails to properly mark lookup-plugin results as unsafe. If an attacker could control the results of lookup() calls, they could inject Unicode strings to be parsed by the jinja2 templating system, resulting in code execution. By default, the jinja2 templating language is now marked as 'unsafe' and is not evaluated.",
    "root_cause": "Ansible failed to properly mark lookup-plugin results as unsafe, leading to potential injection of Unicode strings into the jinja2 templating system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Input validation flaw",
      "Improper handling of unsafe data",
       "Lack of sanitization of lookup plugin results"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the Ansible server.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker with control over the results of `lookup()` calls can inject malicious code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the results of lookup() calls.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises because data returned from lookup() functions was not marked as unsafe. This allowed unicode strings to pass through to the jinja2 templating system without proper sanitization or escaping, leading to code execution. The fix involves ensuring that Jinja2 templating language is marked as unsafe by default and is not evaluated unless explicitly allowed by the user."
