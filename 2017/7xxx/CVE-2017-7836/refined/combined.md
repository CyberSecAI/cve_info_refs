## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 57

Announced
November 14, 2017
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 57

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

##### References

* [Bug 1406750](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406750)
* [Bug 1412252](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412252)

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

##### References

* [Bug 1408990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990)

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

##### References

* [Bug 1392026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026)

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1370497](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497)

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

##### References

* [Bug 1402363](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363)

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1401339](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339)

#### [#CVE-2017-7837: SVG loaded as <img> can use meta tags to set cookies](#CVE-2017-7837)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

SVG loaded through `<img>` tags can use `<meta>` tags within the SVG data to set cookies for that page.

##### References

* [Bug 1325923](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923)

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

##### References

* [Bug 1399540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540)

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

##### References

* [Bug 1402896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896)

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

##### References

* [Bug 1366420](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366420)

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.

##### References

* [Bug 1397064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064)

#### [#CVE-2017-7827: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 57](#CVE-2017-7827)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_12\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.113 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Introduction:
The pingsender executable dynamically loads libcurl, using dlopen and hardcoded library list.
According to the manpages, the order of execution for dlopen will be:
When path does not contain a slash character (i.e. it is just a leaf name), dlopen() searches the following until it finds a compatible Mach-O file:
$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, $DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, current working directory, $DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH.
Further:
Note: If DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH is not set, dlopen operates as if DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH was set to $HOME/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib.
The vulnerable file is located on: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/pingsender/pingsender_unix_common.cpp>
The offending dlopen code dlopen is in line 105
mLib = dlopen(libname, RTLD\_NOW);
And in line 84 through 101:
const char\* libcurlNames[] = {
"libcurl.so",
"libcurl.so.4",
// Debian gives libcurl a different name when it is built against GnuTLS
"libcurl-gnutls.so.4",
// Older libcurl if we can't find anything better
"libcurl.so.3",
#ifndef HAVE\_64BIT\_BUILD
// 32-bit versions on 64-bit hosts
"/usr/lib32/libcurl.so",
"/usr/lib32/libcurl.so.4",
"/usr/lib32/libcurl-gnutls.so.4",
"/usr/lib32/libcurl.so.3",
#endif
// macOS
"libcurl.dylib",
"libcurl.4.dylib",
"libcurl.3.dylib"
};
By writing a malicious dylib, in ~/lib, an attacker can attain local execution privileges.
Further - on every subsequent telemetry request, the code will be executed.
Instruction to reproduce:
Save the C file and compile to generate a dyilib:
gcc -c poc.c
gcc -dynamiclib -current\_version 1.0 poc.o -o libcurl.dylib
Ensure that Enable Firefox Health Report is enabled On Firefox -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Data Choices
Open and close Firefox.
This is a bad security practice, you can read more about it (although on a Windows world) on:
<http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2014/01/unsafe-dll-loading-vulnerabilities.html>
Actual results:
Code was executed (Calculator was opened)
Expected results:
A list with the known paths should had been provided.

Yeah, this is going to be tricky on Linux. On Mac it's easy to hardcode the paths where Apple usually puts libcurl, but on Linux there's a plethora of possible places, some architecture dependent (e.g. on Debian). I'll look into this tomorrow, worst case we'll have a very long list.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(gsvelto)

Just checking - this isn't a sandbox escape right? I assume post-level3 (actually level2 even), that the content process would not have the ability to write to ~/lib?

I'm not familiar with Firefox sandbox architecture, but from what I read in the documentation:
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox/Deny_Filesystem_Access>
"Some directories are read/write protected, but this will not provide real security until the bulk of the $HOME directory is read/write protected.
On OS X, the Firefox Profile directory is stored within ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/. ~/Library is read/write protected with a few exceptions for some specific subdirectories. Access to $HOME and other areas of the filesystem is not restricted. i.e., the content process can read and write to/from anywhere the OS permits: $HOME and temporary directories. The ~/Library read/write prevention could be bypassed because the rest of the $HOME is read/write accessible. For example, a compromised process could add malicious commands to ~/.login-type files to copy data from ~/Library when a user logs in."

Unfortunately that wikipage hasn't been updated since october 2016 ( <https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Security/Sandbox/Deny_Filesystem_Access&action=history> ). Based on <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mozilla.dev.platform/sandbox|sort:date/mozilla.dev.platform/HJZg_RVZDao/I3I3yYuDAwAJ> , I think the situation is better than that, especially for 56 which we're shipping next week, but Paul will have more details.

"By writing a malicious dylib, in ~/lib, an attacker can attain local execution privileges."
If an attacker has the ability to put a malicious dylib in ~/lib they \_already\_ have local execution privileges. As Paul was getting at, this is mostly interesting as a potential vector for sandbox escapes, and the wiki quote shows we know our current protection is incomplete.

The Windows problem is worse. The "Current" directory is often easily writable depending on how you launch an executable, and the original search path looked there \_first\_. Even the "Safe" version eventually looked there. Only if you set the search path to "" can you mitigate the worst of the problem. Even then, if the attacker can write to the installation directory or any of the Windows directories they can usually inject into your process--but then again they could also just overwrite your program or one of the legitimate Windows .dlls.Group: firefox-core-security → toolkit-core-securityKeywords: [csectype-other](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-other&resolution=---),

Note that on Windows the pingsender doesn't load any DLL dynamically. This is Mac/Linux specific.

Well, I played a little bit with this, and there are two interesting scenarios in Mac:
a) CWD is the first directory where it's searched. (so potential sandbox escape...)
b) By doing dlopen, you're bypassing Mac gatekeeper (you're not getting the pesky "This binary was downloaded from the internet / was not signed" ) dialog box.
Although I'm happy that it's being taken into consideration (and worked on it quickly... BIG KUDOS!), I'm not sure about the moderate impact classification (due to the gatekeeper bypass by using Firefox signed and trusted binaries....)
Anyways, thanks for your attention. This is my first time disclosing to the Mozilla Foundation and I'm happily surprised by the time to patch.

Actually - I'm not sure about the potential sandbox escape, as I wrote before I'm not familiar with the sandbox, but I'm downloading and building Firefox from source now...

I've just tested it, double-checked what the pingsender was doing, and I cannot reproduce anymore.

Not really, dlopen() will pick the right library anyway so I thought it wasn't worth the fuss.

Yep, I was aware of that but couldn't find a reliable way to do it except for adding the entire list of architectures Debian supports to the list. I suppose we can add more as we need them. If there is an easy way to guess the right directory at runtime we could make it more robust though but I haven't investigated that either.

I'm inclined to question the need to hardcode paths on linux at all. There's no stupid fallback like DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH or the current working directory, and if an attacker can make you run pingsender with an altered LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, you're already owned.

I tend to agree but I'm no security expert so I'm not sure what are the current best practices as far as dlopen() is concerned.

I tend to agree.
0. If you could get libraries into a malicious directory that dlopen would search, probably you could just shadow something like libc that's DT\_NEEDED instead.
1. In particular, it looks like we wouldn't search $ORIGIN in official builds, so the search path should be entirely directories specified in system-level config or in the environment (which, as mentioned above, if that's a problem then you're already owned).
2. The only case I can think of that would cause a sandbox escape as of 57 is if Firefox is run from a subdirectory of /tmp (see also [bug 1386404](/show_bug.cgi?id=1386404 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop allowing Linux content processes to access /tmp")), \*and\* it's built with $ORIGIN in DT\_RUNPATH for some reason. However, in that case the attacker could just replace part of the Firefox install itself, so this change doesn't help.

Yes, but I'd suggest having glandium double-check my reasoning in [comment #26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339#c26 "RESOLVED FIXED - The pingsender executable dynamically loads libcurl, using dlopen and hardcoded library list.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

Jake Archibald at google noticed some weird behavior. See this demo:
<https://firefox-redirect-bug.glitch.me/>
Source code is at:
<https://glitch.com/edit/#!/firefox-redirect-bug?path=public/script.js:1:0>
In this case he is trying to fail a fetch() call by redirecting from an https:// origin to an http:// origin. This does produce the failure message:
Blocked loading mixed active content “<http://example.com/>”
But the fetch() succeeds and the 302 response is returned instead.
I instrumented FetchDriver a bit and its actually not seeing an AsyncOnChannelRedirect() call. Instead its just getting an OnStartRequest() with a channel with a successful mStatus.
Christoph, is this a problem with our AsyncOpen2() security checks? Or is it possible an http cache issue, Honza?
I'm marking this a secure bug since Jake told me that some sites include private information in redirects that should not be exposed to scripts.

In the short term I can fix this by failing the fetch if we get OnStartRequest with a redirect status when redirect mode is not manual.

Andrew, this patch makes us fail any unexpected 30x responses from necko at the FetchDriver. In general we should not see these, but it seems they can happen when the redirect is failed for things like mixed content.Assignee: nobody → bkellyStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

The problem with fixing this at the Fetch API layer, though, is that other necko consumers may have the same problem. It seems XHR probably needs to be fixed as well.

Okay, so we expose the content of a redirect when it goes from HTTPS to HTTP? That is somewhat problematic given <https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#atomic-http-redirect-handling>. The site would first need to be XSS'd successfully though before an attacker could steal such a token and the site would need to redirect to an HTTP service which seems less likely and would already reveal the token to network attackers as well. Unless I'm missing something I don't think this is severe.Flags: needinfo?(annevk)

At first, I was thinking it can't be a problem for AsyncOpen2(), since I was thinking we have tests for that. Now I looked at the code and compared CSP and MixedContentBlocker redirect handling. It seems for CSP, we explicitly Cancel() the old channel [1], while for MixedContent we don't do that [2]. Looking at the comments of AsyncOnChannelRedirect() [3] that shouldn't be a problem though, but also wanted to make sure. Nevertheless, the fetch should go through [2] and returning an error from within that function should prevent the channel from loading any data.
@Honza: Is the above a potential issue?
@ Kate (Tanvi is not accepting ni? requests): I thought we have tests for mixed content redirect handling, but I couldn't fine any in dom/security/test/mixedcontentblocker/. There are only wpt tests for redirect handling. If we don't have mixed content redirect tests, could you please file a bug for that? We definitely need those.

I believe nsCORSListenerProxy also does an explicit cancel:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsCORSListenerProxy.cpp#741>
I think the explicit cancel is probably what we want here as well.
Christoph, do you mind taking this bug however we decide we want it to go? I think it would be best to fix in the common code instead of in fetch, xhr, other consumers, etc.

So, necko's nsHttpChannel explicitly provides the redirect 30X response to the consumer (mListener) when the redirect is vetoed. This is by design and won't change.
What you want is to explicitly cancel the source channel to not get 30X but a gecko loading error code in OnStartRequest/OnStopRequest instead. What nsCORSListenerProxy does is correct.
What's suggested in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - when a redirect is blocked for mixed content blocking the original redirect response is returned instead") - to call Cancel(NS\_BINDING\_ABORTED) or similar error on the source channel - seems correct to me.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

It does seem problematic that each caller needs to account for this. Ideally that gets abstracted somehow so we don't get this leak if we ever introduce another way to load code.

The source channel cancellation MUST be handled above necko. We want to provide the content of the 30X response by default.

I think there is some confusion. There are kind of 3 layers here:
1. nsIChannel implementations
2. Security proxies and listeners that enforce CORS, mixed content, CSP, etc.
3. End client code like fetch(), xhr, document loading, etc.
Right now its up to layer (3) to cancel on the blocked redirect for mixed content. For things like CORS and CSP we cancel at layer (2). We just need to cancel at layer (2) for mixed content as well.
I think Honza is saying we can't do the cancellation at layer (1).

In the tree, the only mixed-content blocker blocker tests that include tests for redirection are in browser/base/content/test/siteIdentity/browser\_mcb\_redirect.js, and they don't cover this case.
Created [bug 1403406](/show_bug.cgi?id=1403406 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Mixed-content blocker should cancel the channel on redirect to insecure") for testing and adding the Cancel to MCB, but maybe it should be in this instead.Flags: needinfo?(kmckinley)

I'll fix the problem in this bug and will also add the required tests within this bug - thanks kate.

No particular reason. Mostly because we use NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_BAD\_URI when blocking redirects within nsCORSListenerProxy and nsCSPService.

bug\_1402363\_mcb\_redirect.patch
Approval Request Comment
Currently we don't block mixed content redirects. If an HTTPS page hits a 302 to HTTP, then mixed content blocker should block the load which we didn't do correctly.
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
[Bug 418354](/show_bug.cgi?id=418354 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mixed content detection does not take redirection into account") - Mixed content detection does not take redirection into account
[User impact if declined]:
End users might get a false impression, because the pages state seems to be secure but the underlying redirect from HTTPS to HTTP exposes the user to tampering and eavesdropping attacks.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
not yet.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Not really, but there is also the testpage from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - when a redirect is blocked for mixed content blocking the original redirect response is returned instead").
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
XXX
[Is the change risky?]:
Nope, not risky, we are just correctly cancelling the old channel on the network layer if redirect is blocked.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
see previous
[String changes made/needed]:
no

Maybe this bug is the reason we had to disable the mcb\_redirect tests when landing [Bug 418354](/show_bug.cgi?id=418354 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mixed content detection does not take redirection into account"), see:
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8507083&action=diff>
I filed [Bug 1404812](/show_bug.cgi?id=1404812 "NEW - Try to enable mixed content test: browser_mcb_redirect.js") to investigate.

Dan, what do you think? I would rather like to see that fixed in ESR52 as well, allowing mixed content redirects might be troublesome even though we only categorized this bug as sec-moderate.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb) → needinfo?(dveditz)
