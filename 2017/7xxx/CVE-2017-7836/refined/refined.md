{
  "CVE-2017-7836": {
    "Description": "The \"pingsender\" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges. *Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The pingsender executable dynamically loads libcurl using dlopen, searching a hardcoded list of library names and paths. This allows an attacker to place a malicious libcurl in a location where dlopen searches, and the malicious library will be loaded and executed by pingsender.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Unsafe dynamic library loading",
      "Privilege escalation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation; arbitrary code execution with Firefox privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with local system access can place a malicious libcurl library file in a directory where it will be loaded by Firefox's pingsender executable.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local system access; ability to write files to specific directories."
  },
  "CVE-2017-7835": {
    "Description": "Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.",
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "When a resource redirects from HTTPS to HTTP, the mixed content blocker fails to properly cancel the original request, resulting in the insecure resource loading. The redirect response is incorrectly returned to the client.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Mixed content bypass",
       "Insecure redirect handling"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Bypassing mixed content blocking, leading to the loading of insecure content (like scripts) on a secure page. This can expose users to tampering and eavesdropping attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "A website delivers a HTTPS page which loads a resource that redirects to a HTTP URL. The mixed content blocker should block the load, but due to the incorrect handling of the redirect, this blocking fails.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker controls a web server to provide a resource that redirects from HTTPS to HTTP."
