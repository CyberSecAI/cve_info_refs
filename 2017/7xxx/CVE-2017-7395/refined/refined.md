{
  "CVE-2017-7395": {
    "description": "In TigerVNC 1.7.1 (SMsgReader.cxx SMsgReader::readClientCutText), by causing an integer overflow, an authenticated client can crash the server.",
    "root_cause": "The length of the cut text sent by the client is read as a U32 but is then cast into an int. If the value exceeds 0x7fffffff, the resulting int becomes negative leading to an integer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow (CWE-190)"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated client can crash the server, leading to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated client needs to send a specially crafted `ClientCutText` message with a length value exceeding 0x7fffffff to trigger the overflow.",
     "additional_details": "The code failed to properly validate the converted integer length, causing the server to attempt an allocation using the negative value and subsequently crash."
