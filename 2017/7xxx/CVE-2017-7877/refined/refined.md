- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FlatCore CMS application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that are executed on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on the admin dashboard.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create a new administrator account, thus gaining full control over the application. Other admin actions are also vulnerable to CSRF (e.g. injecting javascript via the Global Headers).
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can create an HTML page with a form that automatically sends a request to the vulnerable application with malicious parameters. By tricking a logged-in administrator to load the page, the attacker can execute arbitrary actions within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged in admin user into accessing a malicious web page. This can be achieved through social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities in other applications.
