**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `XmlUtils` class within the `org.jbpm.migration` package of jbpm-designer. This class, when parsing XML files, was configured to perform expansion of external parameter entities by using a wrongly configured `DocumentBuilder`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core issue is an XXE vulnerability, which occurs when an XML parser processes external entities defined in a malicious XML document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read files accessible to the user running the application server.
- **Potential for Advanced Attacks:** The attacker could potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks, although the specific nature of these attacks is not detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker.
- **Malicious XML:** The attack vector involves parsing crafted XML files containing malicious external entity definitions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to Send Malicious XML:** The attacker must be able to send crafted XML files to be processed by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in BPM 7.1.0 but also affects Red Hat JBoss BRMS and BPM Suite
- The issue was resolved by removing the jPDL migration plugin and its use from the jbpm-designer.
- The fix for this issue is included in Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.4.7 and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.7, released via advisories RHSA-2017:3354 and RHSA-2017:3355 respectively.
