REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. While REDCap can be used to collect virtually any type of data in any environment (including compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, HIPAA, and GDPR), it is specifically geared to support online and offline data capture for research studies and operations. The REDCap Consortium, a vast support network of collaborators, is composed of thousands of active institutional partners in over one hundred countries who utilize and support their own individual REDCap systems. Please visit the [Join](https://projectredcap.org/partners/join/) page to learn how your non-profit organization can join the consortium, or explore the first section on our [FAQ](https://projectredcap.org/about/faq/) for other options to use REDCap.

# CVE-2017-7351: REDCap 7.0.0 - 7.0.10 SQL Injection

Jack Hall

08 Feb 2018

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in REDCap versions 7.0.0 – 7.0.10.  This has been designated [CVE-2017-7351](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-7351).

# What is REDCap?

According to [https://projectredcap.org](https://projectredcap.org/), 2018:

*“REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. While REDCap can be used to collect virtually any type of data (including 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, and HIPAA-compliant environments), it is specifically geared to support online or offline data capture for research studies and operations.”*

Redcap stands for Research Electronic Data CAPture and is used by a large variety of organisations around the world. At the time of writing, their website claims to have 2,669 institutions which collaborate in the development and use of this software.
The vast majority of the user-base for this application appear to be operating within either the Educational or Medical sectors.

# What is the vulnerability?

The vulnerability identified allows an attacker to inject code into the main database of the application. This unfiltered communication to the database provides the capability to access and read all information stored within.
Accessing the database *does* require a valid user account, however a user with any level of privilege can be used in order to carry out the attack.

# Why is this bad?

Despite an attacker only being capable of reading the information within the database, this could provide them with the means to escalate privileges within the application by dumping the usernames and password hashes stored within. Should they successfully manage to obtain this data, the attacker only needs to crack the hash in order to receive increased privileges.

# How do I fix this?

Fortunately, a mitigation for this vulnerability has already been implemented in version 7.0.11 of REDCap. If your institution is running an outdated version of the software then it is heavily advised that it is patched to the latest available version.

# The technical stuff

The file upload handler `SendITController:upload` on versions 7.0.X through 7.0.10 of REDCap does not perform sufficient sanitization on user input.
This allows an attacker to conduct blind, time-based SQL injection; providing sufficient time is provided, this could result in full enumeration of confidential data including usernames, password hashes, password reset questions and logs.
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires access to a registered account; however, that account requires no special privileges.
This proof of concept causes vulnerable versions of the application to hang for 5 seconds:
`route=SendItController:upload' AND SLEEP(5) AND '1'='1`
Identification of this vulnerability was performed on version 7.0.5, however REDCap confirmed that the handler was initially implemented in version 7.0.0, with the security mitigations being introduced in version 7.0.11.
