  "CVE-2017-7511": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Poppler. A remote attacker, by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF, could execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service condition.",
    "Root cause": "The provided patch shows that the vulnerability stems from a lack of checks before accessing pages. Specifically, the `pdfunite` utility in Poppler was crashing when trying to access properties of a page in a PDF document if the page parsing failed. This is due to the application not verifying that the page was successfully parsed before accessing it. This can lead to a crash and potentially other issues.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper validation/handling of page parsing failures in `pdfunite` leading to potential crash"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (crash) by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted PDF file"
    ],
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted PDF file and have the victim open it.",
    "Additional Information": "The patch introduces additional checks to ensure a page is valid before accessing itâ€™s data, preventing the crash. The commit message also mentions that the fix addresses bugs #101153 and #101149 which relate to crashes caused by broken or unparseable pages in pdfunite."
