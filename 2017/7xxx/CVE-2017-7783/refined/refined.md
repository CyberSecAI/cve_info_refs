Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7783:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2017-7783. The official description for CVE-2017-7783 is:

> "If a long user name is used in a username/password combination in a site URL (such as `http://UserName:Password@example.com`), the resulting modal prompt will hang in a non-responsive state or crash, causing a denial of service."

This description aligns with the information found within the provided documents.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient handling of long usernames within the URL's authentication scheme. Specifically:

- When a URL includes a username and password (e.g., `http://username:password@example.com`), the browser extracts the username to display in an authentication prompt.
- When this username is excessively long, the prompt's rendering logic fails, causing a hang or crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The browser failed to limit the length of the username extracted from the URL when generating the authentication prompt.
- **Denial of Service Vulnerability:** The uncontrolled input leads to a denial-of-service condition, where the browser becomes unresponsive.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit results in the browser becoming unresponsive or crashing. The user is effectively locked out from further browsing.
- **Forced Content Viewing:** As described in exploit-db content, an attacker can create a web page that, when visited, locks the victim's browser and forces the user to view content controlled by the attacker.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URLs:** Attackers can craft URLs with excessively long usernames and distribute them through various methods.
- **Embedded URLs:** Attackers could embed these crafted URLs in web pages, emails, or instant messages.
- **Forced redirects**: The exploit-db content demonstrates usage of javascript to force the victim browser to load the malicious URL, creating the DOS situation after a defined delay.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to create and distribute URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL with a long username and deliver the URL to the victim. This can be done through various channels like website links, emails, or other messaging platforms.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 55, by truncating the username to a displayable length.
-   The vulnerability was classified as "low" severity due to it being considered a denial-of-service issue and not resulting in direct data compromise.
-   The patch implemented a truncation of the username and host to prevent this attack.
