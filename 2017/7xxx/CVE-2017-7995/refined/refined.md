  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2017-7995",
    "description": "Xen PV guest before Xen 4.3 checked access permissions to MMIO ranges only after accessing them, allowing host PCI device space memory reads, leading to information disclosure. This is an error in the get_user function. NOTE: the upstream Xen Project considers versions before 4.5.x to be EOL.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from an access-before-verification issue in the `get_user` function of Xen hypervisor versions prior to 4.3. Specifically, memory mapped I/O (MMIO) ranges are accessed before access permissions are checked.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary vulnerability is that the access control check for MMIO memory regions happens after the access, not before.  This is a logic flaw in the get_user() function."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with control of a PV guest can potentially read memory from the host's PCI device space and may disclose sensitive information from hypervisor memory.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is local to the hypervisor. A malicious or compromised PV guest attempts to read MMIO memory regions.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have control of a Paravirtualized (PV) guest. Low privileges within the guest is sufficient to trigger this vulnerability.",
