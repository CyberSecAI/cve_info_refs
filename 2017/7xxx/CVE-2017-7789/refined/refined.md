{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The browser does not correctly handle multiple Strict-Transport-Security (STS) headers sent by the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The browser ignores all but the first STS header when multiple headers are sent.",
      "The browser does not adhere to the HSTS specification which mandates processing only the first STS header when multiple are present."
    ],
    "impact": "HSTS is not enabled for the connection, leading to a potential security risk. This means that the browser may not enforce HTTPS for subsequent connections to the website, leaving it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker could configure a web server or a proxy to send multiple STS headers, bypassing HSTS protection in the browser.",
      "An attacker could inject a malicious STS header through a compromised server or network equipment."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs the ability to control or manipulate the HTTP response headers sent by the web server or proxy.",
        "The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the user, as the attack works via HTTP responses."
      ]
