Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data passed through HTTP GET parameters to the `ocelot_info.php` script. Specifically, the `action` and `userid` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable website, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Other malicious actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameters:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with specially crafted `action` and/or `userid` parameters. The user needs to visit the manipulated URL for the XSS payload to trigger.
- The vulnerable URL is: `Gazelle-master/sections/tools/data/ocelot_info.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and get a user of the vulnerable application to click the link or have the link triggered.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) URLs demonstrating the exploit using the `alert()` JavaScript function:
    - `http://localhost/.../Gazelle-master/sections/tools/data/ocelot_info.php?action=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22`
    - `http://localhost/.../Gazelle-master/sections/tools/data/ocelot_info.php?userid=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22`

- Another github link provided includes code that was developed to address this vulnerability.
