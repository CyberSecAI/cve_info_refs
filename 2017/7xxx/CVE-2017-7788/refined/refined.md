Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7788:

**CVE-2017-7788: Sandboxed about:srcdoc iframes do not inherit CSP directives**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that when an `iframe` has a `sandbox` attribute and its content is specified using `srcdoc`, that content does not inherit the containing page's Content Security Policy (CSP). This occurs because the CSP was not being applied to the `about:srcdoc` iframe content when the iframe was sandboxed.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CSP Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of the Content Security Policy (CSP). CSP is a security mechanism designed to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks. By not inheriting the parent's CSP, the sandboxed `about:srcdoc` iframe is able to execute scripts or load content that would have otherwise been blocked.
    *  **Inconsistent CSP enforcement:**  The vulnerability creates an inconsistency in how CSP is enforced, depending on whether the iframe is sandboxed and using `srcdoc` or not.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the `srcdoc` iframe and have them execute, bypassing the intended security of the parent page's CSP.
    *  **Information Disclosure**: The lack of CSP enforcement could lead to information disclosure by loading resources that should have been blocked.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious web pages:** An attacker could create a malicious webpage with a sandboxed iframe with `srcdoc` attribute, injecting malicious content within the iframe using the `srcdoc` attribute.
    *   **Compromised websites:**  A compromised legitimate site could inject such iframes into their content to attack users.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to control or inject content into a webpage that can then load the vulnerable iframe.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious content within the `srcdoc` attribute.

The provided bug report also includes detailed information about the fix:

*   **Fix:** The fix involves modifying `nsScriptSecurityManager.cpp` to ensure that when a sandboxed iframe with `srcdoc` is created, the CSP of the parent is correctly inherited into the new iframe's principal. This was achieved by checking if a load is `about:srcdoc` or a data URI and applying the parent's CSP. A new `SetCSP` method was also implemented on the `BasePrincipal` class to allow the copying of CSPs between principals.

*   **Mitigation**: The `sandbox` attribute needs to have the `allow-same-origin` directive explicitly set to allow the `srcdoc` to inherit the CSP.

* **Additional notes**: The bug report also indicates that several similar issues were found, all related to the CSP not being correctly applied to sandboxed iframes with `srcdoc`, which reinforces the vulnerability.
