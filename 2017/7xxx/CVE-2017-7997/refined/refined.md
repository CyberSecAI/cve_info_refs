Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7997:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Gespage web application does not properly filter user-supplied parameters, allowing for SQL injection. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to stacked queries and comments in the SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user inputs passed via HTTP POST parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could retrieve sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could update or modify data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation**: By updating the admin password hash in the database, attackers can gain administrative access to the web application.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Through the SQLi, further attacks are possible, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP POST requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the target Gespage application.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web application, requiring a valid JSESSIONID cookie.

**Vulnerable parameters/pages:**
- `show_prn` parameter on `/ges/webapp/users/prnow.jsp`
- `show_month` parameter on `/ges/webapp/users/blhistory.jsp`
- `show_month` parameter on `/ges/webapp/users/prhistory.jsp`

**Exploitation methods:**
- **Time-based SQL injection:**  The vulnerability can be detected by injecting a `PG_SLEEP()` function into the SQL query.
- **Direct SQL Injection:** It is possible to inject arbitrary SQL queries to extract, modify, or add data into the database.
- **Password Change:**  A python script was provided in the exploit details that leverages the SQL injection to change the administrator password, allowing for full control of the application.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit uses stacked SQL queries and comments (`--`) to inject malicious code.
- The vulnerability affects Gespage versions up to 7.4.8.
- The exploit requires a valid `JSESSIONID` cookie for authentication.
-  A proof-of-concept and a python script is provided to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be further exploited with tools like `sqlmap`.

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS Base Score: 8.6
- CVSS Vector String: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
