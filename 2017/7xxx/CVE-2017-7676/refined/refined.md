Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7676:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in how the Apache Ranger policy resource matcher handled wildcard characters, specifically the asterisk '*'. The matcher would effectively ignore any characters placed after the wildcard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Wildcard Handling:** The policy resource matcher incorrectly processed wildcard characters ('*'), ignoring any subsequent characters. This resulted in policies applying to resources they were not intended to match.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect Policy Application:**  Due to the incorrect wildcard handling, policies could be applied to a broader range of resources than intended. This could lead to unintended access being granted or denied, potentially compromising data security and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Policy Definition:** The vulnerability is exploited when defining policies using wildcard characters followed by other characters (e.g., `my*test`, `test*.txt`). When such policies are evaluated, the intended resource matching will fail, and the policy may apply where not intended.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ranger Policy Configuration Access:** The attacker would need the ability to configure Ranger policies to create policies with wildcards. This typically requires administrative access to Apache Ranger.

**Summary:**

This CVE describes a vulnerability where the Apache Ranger policy resource matcher incorrectly handles wildcards ('*'). Characters after the wildcard are ignored, leading to unintended policy applications. This could have severe consequences depending on how policies are configured.
