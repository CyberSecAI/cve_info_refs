  "CVE-2017-7285": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the network stack of MikroTik Version 6.38.5 could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to exhaust all available CPU via a flood of TCP RST packets, preventing the affected router from accepting new TCP connections.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the MikroTik router's network stack processes TCP RST packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of TCP RST packets",
      "Lack of rate limiting or resource management for RST packets."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The router's CPU is exhausted, preventing it from accepting new TCP connections and effectively disrupting its functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker is able to send TCP RST packets to the target router.",
    "exploit_code": {
      "language": "Perl",
      "description": "The provided Perl script crafts and sends a continuous stream of TCP RST packets to the target, causing the DoS. The script takes source IP, source port, destination IP, and destination port as arguments."
    },
      "additional_information": "The exploit code also includes IP header creation, TCP header creation with the RST flag set, and checksum calculation. The attack involves sending a continuous flood of these specially crafted RST packets to exhaust CPU resources of the target router."
  }
