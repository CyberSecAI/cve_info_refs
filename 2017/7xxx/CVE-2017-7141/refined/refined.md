The provided content mentions CVE-2017-7141:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that turning off the "Load remote content in messages" setting in Mail did not apply to all mailboxes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent application of the "Load remote content" setting across mailboxes.

**Impact of exploitation:** The sender of an email could determine the IP address of the recipient, even if the recipient had disabled remote content loading. This would happen when the mail client fetches remote resources, which can reveal the client's IP.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by receiving a specially crafted email that includes remote content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs the ability to send an email to the victim.
