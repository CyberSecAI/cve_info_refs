Subject: CVE-2017-7467: minicom and prl-vzvncserver vt100.c escparms[] buffer overflow

Hi,

This is to announce a vulnerability that has just been fixed in minicom
2.7.1 released earlier today, and that had been found and fixed in
derived code in prl-vzvncserver (a Virtuozzo 7 component) earlier this
year.  minicom 2.7.1 is available for download at:

<https://alioth.debian.org/projects/minicom/>

The main bug is that in minicom's vt100.c escparms[] is declared as:

static void (*vt_keyb)(int, int);/* Gets called for NORMAL/APPL switch. */
static void (*termout)(const char *, int);/* Gets called to output a string. */

static int escparms[8];         /* Cumulated escape sequence. */
static int ptr;                 /* Index into escparms array. */
static long vt_tabs[5];         /* Tab stops for max. 32*5 = 160 columns. */

but is filled as:

  /* See if a number follows */
  if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {
    escparms[ptr] = 10*escparms[ptr] + c - '0';
    return;
  }
  /* Separation between numbers ? */
  if (c == ';') {
    if (ptr < 15)
      ptr++;
    return;
  }

Notice the 8 vs. 15 (meaning 16 elements) discrepancy.

At least in the Fedora 23 package of minicom, this lets me adjust or
replace the termout function pointer.  If the variables were put in .bss
in the other order (perhaps by a different compiler), then ptr could be
overwritten, which is likely also exploitable.

Here's how to reproduce:

mkfifo fifo
gdb /usr/bin/minicom

(gdb) r -oD fifo
Starting program: /usr/bin/minicom -oD fifo

On another terminal:

echo -ne "\033[0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;00000000000000000000001094795585;00000000000000000000001094795585" > fifo

Then press Enter in minicom, and:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
                                                    0x000055555555d31f in v_termout ()
(gdb) disass

(gdb) x/2x 0x5555557831e0
0x5555557831e0:	0x41414141	0x41414141

As you can see, I am able to control the address to branch to.  Moreover,
on typical 64-bit little-endian there's partial ASLR (PIE) bypass due to
ability to keep most significant 32 bits of the function pointer intact.

Thus, this bug likely allows for remote code execution.

In the PoC above, the decimal numbers (corresponding to the 32-bit
pointer halves) include leading zeroes (for exactly 32 digits in each
number) in order to completely shift out, one bit at a time, the
previous contents of the v_termout pointer.  This works due to the
multiplier 10 including 2 as a factor.

The fix included in minicom 2.7.1 is simply:

-	if (ptr < 15)
+	if (ptr < 7)

(I guess a later code revision could introduce a macro for this array's
size, or determine the array size by dividing two sizeof's.)

I'd like to thank Adam Lackorzynski, CC'ed here, for producing the new
minicom release promptly and in time for this announcement.

I first found the bug during Openwall's security audit of the
Virtuozzo 7 product, which contains derived downstream code in its
prl-vzvncserver component.  The corresponding Virtuozzo 7 fix is:

<https://src.openvz.org/projects/OVZ/repos/prl-vzvncserver/commits/6d95404e75b98f36b1cc85ee23df99dcf06ca13f>

We would like to thank the Virtuozzo company for funding the effort.

In prl-vzvncserver, the escparms[] overflow wasn't obviously exploitable
due to different nearby variables:

static int esc_s = 0;

#define ESC 27

static unsigned char vt_fg;             /* Standard foreground color. */
static unsigned char vt_bg;             /* Standard background color. */

static int escparms[8];         /* Cumulated escape sequence. */
static int ptr;                 /* Index into escparms array. */

static short newy1 = 0;         /* Current size of scrolling region. */
static short newy2 = 23;

but it also was clearly triggerable, as seen in an ASan-enabled build:

==45204== ERROR: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow on address 0x0000006164a0 at pc 0x40c922 bp 0x7fffffffa700 sp 0x7fffffffa6f0

  'escparms (vt100.c)' is ascii string ''

In VzLinux's build of prl-vzvncserver as of when this issue was
discovered, the following variables happened to follow escparms[] and
were close enough: esc_s, vt_fg, vt_bg.  Changing esc_s is benign - for
valid values, it could as well be done directly (with the proper
escapes), and the invalid values are unused.  Changing vt_fg or/and
vt_bg might have some other ill effects, although we'd expect only out
of bound reads, so at worst crashes.  That's because prl-vzvncserver's
console.c defines only a 16 entry colourMap.  In LibVNCServer, that
table appears to be used to initialize related tables with bigger
elements, but those inherit the size of 16.  Out of bound reads from
those tables in LibVNCServer might be triggered through having the color
numbers above 15 written to the frameBuffer (which console.c will
happily do once we overwrote vt_fg or/and vt_bg with such values) and
then accessed via certain parts of LibVNCServer's code.  We did not
actually test for these potential ill effects of overwriting vt_fg
or/and vt_bg.  Regardless, it is inappropriate and unsafe to rely on a
specific memory layout of a binary build, and of course the issue was
promptly fixed.

Some other issues inherited from minicom likely were exploitable in
prl-vzvncserver - namely, incomplete validation of cursor coordinates
in vt100.c.  In minicom itself, there's further validation in mc_*()
functions.  In prl-vzvncserver, there was no such validation in its
equivalent functions - and there are now more commits in the above
repository fixing those issues (besides the commit referenced above).
Specifically, a likely exploitable code path was triggered e.g. with:

echo -ne "\033[2147483648B"

but this appears to do little against minicom.(*)  In fact, I ran a
rather extensive set of escape sequences against minicom, which
triggered no other crashes besides the escparms[] buffer overflow
reported here.

(*) Formally speaking, the code is also triggering C's undefined
behavior when it allows signed integers to overflow.  In practice, so
far compilers only make use of compile-time detectable UB of this kind
(such as to drop the UB-triggering code as an optimization, since they
are allowed to).

One change minicom could make later is switch to using unsigned types
for escparms and coordinates.  But we'd need to carefully review all
uses for that, in case any place relies on a value temporarily becoming
negative and on checking for that.

prl-vzvncserver was using int and switched to "unsigned short".
This may be weird, but it actually helps avoid integer overflows in
calculations as inputs to calculations become more limited whereas
intermediate results get promoted to int.

Besides minicom and prl-vzvncserver, I managed to identify just one
other project reusing this code (and also containing the issues), but
it's obscure (likely unused):

<https://github.com/sigflup/vt100>

I did not bother notifying this project in advance (putting the
information at unjustified risk), but I intend to notify it now.

For those into CVEs: CVE-2017-7467 is only for the escparms[] buffer
overflow (in all projects reusing this code), not for other issues
casually mentioned in here (even if some of them had higher impact on
prl-vzvncserver).  Those other issues have no CVE IDs.

Timeline:

20161228 - bug found in prl-vzvncserver
20161229 - report to Virtuozzo
20170109 - fix committed in Virtuozzo (became part of an update later)
20170407 - report to minicom
20170408 - initial heads-up and CVE request via distros@vs, no detail
20170411 - detail shared with distros@vs
20170418 - fixed minicom release, public disclosure

# minicom: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201706-13**

An out-of-bounds data access in minicom might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dialup/minicom** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.1** |

### Background

Minicom is a text-based serial port communications program.

### Description

In minicom before version 2.7.1, the escparms[] buffer in vt100.c is
vulnerable to an overflow.

### Impact

A remote attacker, able to connect to a minicom port, could possibly
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, or cause a
Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All minicom users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dialup/minicom-2.7.1"

```

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: On a Mac OS X system with Portage installed, FEATURES="-sandbox" USE="gtk" ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="macos ~macos ~ppc ppc"  emerge ettercap Actual Results:   It failed with the error in the Details section.  Expected Results:   It should have compiled :)  PPC G4 running OSX 10.3.5 ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robin Munn    2004-09-05 14:32:14 UTC  ``` The included Makefile in libpcap-0.8.3.tar.gz only compiles static libraries; the ebuild includes the line:      gcc -Wl,-soname,libpcap.so.0 -shared -fPIC -o libpcap.so.${PV:0:3} *.o  to build a shared library after the Makefile has built a static library.  But the required gcc options for building shared libraries are different in OS X. Instead of -shared, you use -dynamiclib. And instead of passing "-soname libpcap.so.0" to the linker (which is what "-Wl,-soname,libpcap.so.0" does), you pass those arguments to gcc as well; -soname becomes -install_name, and is supposed to include the path where the library will eventually be installed. Thus "-Wl,-soname,libpcap.so.0" becomes "-install_name /usr/lib/libpcap.0.dylib".  Then there's a couple other things to keep in mind: by default, when you build a shared library, OS X's gcc builds what is called a "two-level namespace" library. You probably wanted a "flat namespace" library instead. (The difference between the two is explained over at <http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/TwoLevelNamespaces.html>). So you need the "-flat_namespace" flag as well when you build your shared library. And finally, you're going to need to specify a "compatibility version" and a "current version" for this dynamic library. The "current version" is just what is sounds like: the current version of the library. Here you can just use the same version number as the library itself (in this case, 0.8.3). The "compatibility version" is what the OS X linker looks at to see if it's got compatible versions of a library. Here, unless you know what you're doing, a good default is probably the first three characters of the version number (in this case, 0.8).  Putting all that together, the command you're going to want is:      gcc -dynamiclib -flat_namespace -install_name /usr/lib/libpcap.0.dylib -compatibility_version ${PV:0:3} -current_version ${PV} -fPIC -o libpcap.${PV:0:3}.dylib *.o ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robin Munn    2004-09-05 14:42:30 UTC  ``` Well, if you use that command line to compile, there's one more problem: you'll get an error like "ld: common symbols not allowed with MH_DYLIB output format with the -multi_module option".  Looking at how fink solved this one, I see they included a patch that adds "-fno-common" to CFLAGS in the Makefile. That should take care of the "common symbols not allowed" problem. (Does anyone know the difference between "common" symbols and, well, un"common" ones?) ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robin Munn    2004-09-05 14:46:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 39007](attachment.cgi?id=39007 "libpcap-macos.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=39007&action=edit "libpcap-macos.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=39007&action=diff "libpcap-macos.patch")] libpcap-macos.patch  With the addition of -fno-common to CFLAGS, it works. Note that this does overwrite some default Macintosh files, so this is not for the faint of heart. If you really want to install this, you'll need to either use "FEATURES='-collision-protect'", or else (my favorite) find out which files have collisions (it'll probably be /usr/lib/libpcap* and /usr/include/pcap*.h) and then move them out of the way somehow (I renamed them to /usr/lib/libpcap*.orig and /usr/include/pcap*.h.orig).  Here's a patch that adds -fno-common to CFLAGS in the Makefile. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robin Munn    2004-09-05 14:48:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 39008](attachment.cgi?id=39008 "libpcap-0.8.3-r1.ebuild.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=39008&action=edit "libpcap-0.8.3-r1.ebuild.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=39008&action=diff "libpcap-0.8.3-r1.ebuild.patch")] libpcap-0.8.3-r1.ebuild.patch  And here's an ebuild patch that will compile a shared libpcap correctly on macos. I've tested this on my iBook G4 running Panther (10.3.5), and it works for me. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Lina Pezzella (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-09 11:52:24 UTC  ``` An older version is already in package.provided. Please test for ppc-darwin if desired, but due to policy we will not be overwriting the already provided version. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Lina Pezzella (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-20 08:52:10 UTC  ``` leaving this one here in case darwin porters care to look at it. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Hasan Khalil (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-01-23 12:58:23 UTC  ``` This depends on [bug 67162](show_bug.cgi?id=67162 "RESOLVED FIXED - Design: how to keyword packages which over-write apple provided files"). Will take a look at it when 67162 has gotten somewhere. Until then, this  bug should remain frozen. ``` |  |
