The provided content is related to CVE-2017-7226.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow in `bfd/peicode.h` occurs due to an incorrect calculation of string length. The code allocates a buffer, reads data into it, and then uses `strlen` to determine the length of what's assumed to be a string within the buffer. However, the read data may not be null-terminated or may contain an overly long string, causing `strlen` to read past the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow. The code in `pe_ILF_object_p` reads data into a buffer, then uses `strlen` on the buffer to determine the end of the string. The code then calculates the address of a second string based on the length of the first string, with an implicit assumption that the first string is valid. When processing a crafted binary, the first string can be larger than expected, causing `strlen` to read beyond the allocated buffer, and `source_dll` to point to invalid memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap buffer overflow can cause a crash due to accessing memory out-of-bounds. It may also allow an attacker to potentially achieve code execution or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted binary file using binutils tools like `addr2line`, `size`, or `strings`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed PE (Portable Executable) file to one of the vulnerable binutils tools. This can be achieved through local access or by enticing a user to process the malicious file.

The vulnerability was fixed by using `strnlen` instead of `strlen` to avoid reading beyond the bounds of the buffer.
