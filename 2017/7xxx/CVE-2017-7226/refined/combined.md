| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=20905#c0)  Thuan Pham    2016-12-02 06:29:31 UTC  ``` Dear all, Using AFLFast (<https://github.com/mboehme/aflfast>), a fork of AFL, with ASAN enabled we found a heap buffer overflow in bfd/peicode.h.   The bug was found on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit & binutils was checked out from <https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb> repository. Its commit is  268ebe95201d2ebdcf68cad9dc67ff6d1e25be9e (Fri Nov 18 14:15:12 2016).  To reproduce:  printf "\x00\x00\xff\xff\x00\x00\x4c\x01\xfb\x5b\x89\x7a\x02\x00\x00\x00\x3a\x7a\x7a\x7a\x7a\x84\x7a\x7a\x7a\x7a\x7e\x5b\x01\x00\x5b\x09\x09\xe6\xff\x00\x00\x00\x7f\xff\x8b\xb3\x09\x2d\x2d\x2d\x2d\x2d\x2d\x2d\x2d\x2d\x2d\x09\x00\x80\x24\x29\x41\x02\x00\x00\x99\x20\x02\x40" > fd  addr2line -e fd  OR  size @- fd  OR  strings -w -d fd  When we run "strings -w -d fd", ASAN says:  ==139869==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x62100001dce0 at pc 0x7f5482b026d3 bp 0x7ffd60c03920 sp 0x7ffd60c030d0 READ of size 4049 at 0x62100001dce0 thread T0     #0 0x7f5482b026d2  (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.3+0x3c6d2)     #1 0x560beb in pe_ILF_object_p ../../bfd/peicode.h:1272     #2 0x560beb in pe_bfd_object_p ../../bfd/peicode.h:1407     #3 0x41848c in bfd_check_format_matches ../../bfd/format.c:311     #4 0x40b137 in strings_object_file ../../binutils/strings.c:411     #5 0x40b137 in strings_file ../../binutils/strings.c:454     #6 0x40b137 in main ../../binutils/strings.c:321     #7 0x7f5481807f44 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21f44)     #8 0x40c376  (/home/ubuntu/subjects/binutils-asan/obj-asan/binutils/strings+0x40c376)  0x62100001dce0 is located 0 bytes to the right of 4064-byte region [0x62100001cd00,0x62100001dce0) allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x7f5482b883a8 in __interceptor_malloc (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.3+0xc23a8)     #1 0x671e38 in objalloc_create ../../libiberty/objalloc.c:95     #2 0x41f61b in _bfd_new_bfd ../../bfd/opncls.c:73     #3 0x41fb71 in bfd_fopen ../../bfd/opncls.c:199     #4 0x40b122 in strings_object_file ../../binutils/strings.c:402     #5 0x40b122 in strings_file ../../binutils/strings.c:454     #6 0x40b122 in main ../../binutils/strings.c:321     #7 0x7f5481807f44 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21f44)  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.3+0x3c6d2)  Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x0c427fffbb40: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c427fffbb50: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c427fffbb60: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c427fffbb70: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x0c427fffbb80: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x0c427fffbb90: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[fa]fa fa fa   0x0c427fffbba0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c427fffbbb0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c427fffbbc0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c427fffbbd0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c427fffbbe0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Heap right redzone:      fb   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack partial redzone:   f4   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb  After checking the code in peicode.h and debugging it in GDB, we found that although the size to allocate ptr is just 36 but after calling bfd_bread, the string length of ptr is much bigger than that. So, ASAN detects the heap buffer overflow in the call strlen(sym_name). The bug allows source_dll pointing to some location outside the boundary of symbol_name/ptr and it could lead to some bad thing if source_dll is not checked & used properly.    ptr = (bfd_byte *) bfd_alloc (abfd, size);   if (ptr == NULL)     return NULL;    if (bfd_bread (ptr, size, abfd) != size)     {       bfd_release (abfd, ptr);       return NULL;     }    symbol_name = (char *) ptr;   source_dll  = symbol_name + strlen (symbol_name) + 1;  Best regards, Thuan ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=20905#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2016-12-05 16:36:02 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Nick Clifton <nickc@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=fa6631b4eecfcca00c13b9594e6336dffd40982f>  commit fa6631b4eecfcca00c13b9594e6336dffd40982f Author: Nick Clifton <nickc@redhat.com> Date:   Mon Dec 5 16:34:45 2016 +0000      Fix seg-fault in the binutils utilities when reading a corrupt input file.          	[PR binutils/20905](show_bug.cgi?id=20905 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap buffer overflow in bfd/peicode.h")     	* peicode.h (pe_ILF_object_p): Use strnlen to avoid running over     	the end of the string buffer. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=20905#c2)  Nick Clifton    2016-12-05 16:37:40 UTC  ``` Hi Thuan,    Thanks for reporting this bug.  I have checked in a patch to prevent the code from trying to read of the end of buffer, which should fix this problem.  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=20905#c3)  Thuan Pham    2017-04-13 06:14:22 UTC  ``` This is CVE-2017-7226 ``` |  |
