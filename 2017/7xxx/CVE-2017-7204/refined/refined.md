Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the security vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization/filtration of user-supplied data within the "name" HTTP GET parameter.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
* **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    * Session hijacking
    * Defacement of the website
    * Phishing attacks
    * Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
    * Data theft
* **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with an XSS payload within the `name` parameter.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    * The attacker needs to craft a URL with a malicious script as the value of `name` GET parameter
    * The victim needs to access that URL to trigger the XSS.

**Technical details:**

The vulnerable URL is `imdbphp-master/demo/search.php`. An example of the exploitation is:
`<http://localhost/github1/.../imdbphp-master/demo/search.php?name=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22>`.
This payload attempts to inject a script tag into the page, which would execute the `alert(1)` javascript function if successful.
