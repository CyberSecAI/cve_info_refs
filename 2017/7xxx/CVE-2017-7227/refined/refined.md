Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7227:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the binutils linker (`ld`) parses linker scripts, specifically when handling strings within the scripts. The issue arises when a malformed string, potentially containing embedded null bytes, is processed. The `xstrdup` function was used to copy strings, which would stop at the null byte, while the parser's length calculation, based on `yyleng`,  might be larger. This discrepancy leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when the `xstrdup` function, used for copying strings, doesn't account for embedded null bytes within the string, and thus allocates too small of a buffer, writing beyond the allocated buffer during the copy.
- **Use-after-free:** The report also indicates that use-after-free issues are observed, although the root cause is the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of the vulnerability is that it can cause a crash in the linker (`ld`). This could lead to a denial of service. Specifically, a specially crafted linker script can cause the `ld` program to crash due to memory corruption.
- **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation leads to memory corruption issues such as heap overflows and use-after-free errors

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Linker Scripts:** The attack vector involves supplying a malformed linker script to the `ld` program. This can be done either directly or indirectly through other processes that might use the linker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the binutils linker (`ld`), usually through a crafted linker script.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report indicates that the issue was found using fuzzing.
- The initial fix involved checking for bogus strings in linker scripts.
- A subsequent fix was made by using the `xmemdup` function instead of `xstrdup`, because `xmemdup` correctly handles the string with embedded null bytes.
- The vulnerability was present in binutils versions prior to 2.29.1-r1.
