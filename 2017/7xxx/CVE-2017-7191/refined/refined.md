Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition that occurs during the processing of netjoins in Irssi.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (CWE-416):** The core issue is that after a `NETJOIN_SERVER_REC` structure is freed, a pointer to it is still held and later dereferenced, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability is likely to be program crashes, manifested as segmentation faults.
- The advisory suggests that while code execution might be theoretically possible, it would be difficult in practice.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering the netjoin processing logic in Irssi, which leads to the vulnerable code path. The precise method to trigger this is not described in this document.
- Based on the commit description ("remove irc servers on 'server disconnected' signal") and the code changes provided, the use after free occurs when an IRC server disconnects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with an Irssi instance in a way that can trigger the disconnection of an IRC server.
- There are no specifics on the exact capabilities, but it is implied that no local access is required.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Incomplete Fix:** The advisory mentions that the initial fix for this vulnerability was incomplete and that there is a follow-up CVE (CVE-2018-7054) that contains more information and a more robust fix.
- **Affected Versions:** Irssi versions 1.0.0 and later are affected, while versions 0.8.21 and prior are not believed to be affected.
- **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Irssi versions 1.0.7 and 1.1.1.
- **Patch:** A link to the commit containing the patch is provided.
- **Severity:** This vulnerability leads to crashes and can be considered a moderately severe security issue.
