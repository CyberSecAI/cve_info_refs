Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7693:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Riverbed App Response web application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the "viewer_script.jsp" script did not sanitize user input, allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Directory Traversal: The application allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended application directory structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could read sensitive files on the file system. Examples in the provided content include:
    - /etc/group
    - /etc/passwd
    - /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

The impact is dependent on the privileges of the user who logged into the application. Lower privilege users may not be able to view all files (e.g. SSH private key), but can still access files like /etc/passwd.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via HTTP requests to the vulnerable "viewer_script.jsp" script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to the Riverbed App Response web application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable URL endpoint and parameters.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable software is OPNET App Response Xpert (ARX) version 9.6.1.
- The vulnerability was disclosed in April 2017.
- The attacker uses the `args` parameter to specify the file path to be read using the `-f` flag, the starting line number with `-s`, the ending line number with `-e`, the number of lines to read with `-l`. The `-x` and `-p` options are also used but not explained.
