{
  "CVE-2017-7895": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations in the Linux kernel lacked proper bounds checking when handling RPC requests.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory access due to lack of bounds checking",
      "Pointer arithmetic errors when handling long arguments in RPC requests"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service (DoS). Additionally, arbitrary memory could be read from both user-space and kernel-space.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted NFSv2/NFSv3 RPC requests with long or malformed arguments.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote user or program with network access to the NFS server. Write access to an NFS mount is required for the information disclosure."
