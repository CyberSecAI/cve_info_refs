{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-7463",
  "description": "JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 are vulnerable to a reflected XSS via artifact upload. A malformed XML file, if uploaded, causes an error message to appear that includes part of the bad XML code verbatim without filtering out scripts. Successful exploitation would allow execution of script code within the context of the affected user.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user input when generating error messages related to artifact uploads, specifically with malformed XML files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary script code within the context of an affected user's browser session, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "A user uploads a malformed XML file containing malicious script code through the artifact upload functionality. The server generates an error message including the unescaped content, which is then rendered in the user's browser.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the application. It does not appear that they need any specific privileges beyond being a normal user able to upload artifacts."
