  "cveId": "CVE-2017-7530",
  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "rootCause": "A missing privilege check when invoking arbitrary methods via filtering on VMs. MiqExpression will execute these methods, and the filtering is triggerable by API users.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing privilege check",
      "Arbitrary method invocation via filtering",
      "MiqExpression execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute actions they should not be allowed to, such as destroying VMs, leading to unauthorized access and control over the system.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "API access",
      "VM filtering mechanism",
       "MiqExpression execution"
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker requires API user access to trigger the vulnerability."
