Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-7535

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Foreman application not properly escaping HTML in the toast notification that appears after assigning hosts to an organization or location. Specifically, if the organization or location name contains HTML, this HTML is rendered instead of being escaped, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the malicious HTML content (in the organization/location name) and later renders it in the toast notification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the toast notification which will execute in the context of the victim's browser, allowing for potentially malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker needs to create or modify an organization or location name to include malicious HTML.
*   A user with the necessary privileges must then attempt to assign hosts to this organization or location. The toast notification will then display and execute the malicious HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify an organization/location name. This likely requires administrative or similar elevated access to the Foreman application.
*   The attacker is not able to directly inject malicious scripts for any user to execute, instead, the user needs to trigger the execution of the malicious code by performing a certain action.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Foreman versions 1.1 and higher.
*   The fix is available in Foreman 1.16.0
*   The issue is tracked upstream as <http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/20963>
*   The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability.
* The Red Hat Bugzilla entry is: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463300>
