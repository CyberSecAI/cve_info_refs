# Foreman 1.1+ stored XSS in organizations/locations assignment to hosts

---

*From*: Marek Hulán <mhulan () redhat com>

*Date*: Mon, 25 Sep 2017 13:36:48 +0200

---

```
CVE-2017-7535: Attempting to assign all hosts to an organization or location
that contains HTML does not properly escape the html in the toast notification
informing of success. Exploiting this requires a user to actively assign hosts
to an organization that contains html in its name which is visible to the user
prior to taking action.

Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher.

Patch available at <https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/4851>
Fix will be released in Foreman 1.16.0 (to be released)
For more information please see the Redmine issue http://
projects.theforeman.org/issues/20963

**Description**

Attempting to assign all hosts to an organization or location that contains HTML does not properly escape the html in the toast notification informing of success.
Setting priority to low since exploiting this requires a user to actively assign hosts to an organization that contains html in its name which is visible to the user prior to taking action.
