  "CVE-2017-7755": {
    "root_cause": "The Firefox installer on Windows can load malicious DLL files from the same directory as the installer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DLL hijacking"
    ],
    "impact": "Privileged execution if the installer is run with elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the Firefox installer.",
      "Running the installer with elevated privileges."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to place files in the same directory as the installer. The user needs to execute the installer with elevated privileges to achieve arbitrary code execution as an admin.",
    "details": "The vulnerability lies in the way the Firefox installer on Windows loads DLLs. It can be made to load malicious DLL files stored in the same directory as the installer when it is run. If the installer is run with elevated privileges, this allows the attacker to run arbitrary code as a privileged user. The fix addresses this issue by ensuring that the installer only loads DLLs from the system directory, preventing DLL hijacking. The vulnerability is present in the stub and full installer."

    "CVE-2017-7751": {
        "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in `nsDocViewerSelectionListener::NotifySelectionChanged` due to incorrect handling of content viewer listeners.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Use-after-free"
        ],
        "impact": "Potentially exploitable crash due to accessing freed memory.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "The provided HTML test case triggers the vulnerability when specific DOM manipulations and event handling occur."
        ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to craft a specific HTML page that causes the sequence of DOM manipulations that triggers the vulnerability.",
        "details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `nsDocViewerSelectionListener::NotifySelectionChanged` function. This function is called when the selection changes. The vulnerability was triggered during the process of updating the document and performing an selection operation after replacing elements in the DOM tree. The patch for the vulnerability addresses it by ensuring that the content viewer listeners are handled only when needed."

  "CVE-2017-7754": {
        "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds read in WebGL when accessing `ImageInfo` objects using `WebGLTexture::ImageInfoAtFace`.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Out-of-bounds read"
        ],
        "impact": "Potential to return a bogus `ImageInfo` object, leading to an exploitable state.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "A malicious WebGL program supplying a large value to `gl.texParameterf(gl.TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, gl.TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL, level)` can cause an out-of-bounds read when calling `WebGLTexture::ImageInfoAtFace`."
        ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious WebGL program that can set a large level value in texture parameters.",
        "details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `WebGLTexture::ImageInfoAtFace` function. The function does not properly validate the `level` parameter when accessing the array of `ImageInfo` objects, allowing for a read out-of-bounds if `level` is sufficiently large. This function calculates a position to access an array of ImageInfo objects with a level and a face. By supplying a sufficiently large value to 'level', it is possible to cause an out-of-bounds array access. The fix checks that a texture's `level_base` is not greater than the maximum number of allowed mipmap levels, preventing the out-of-bounds access."
