Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-7183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the TFTP server component of ExtraPuTTY. It is caused by improper handling of large UDP packets during TFTP read/write requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient input validation/handling of large TFTP request packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can cause a denial of service on the ExtraPuTTY application by sending specially crafted large TFTP read/write request packets.
- The application crashes with an access violation error.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack using the TFTP protocol.
- The attacker sends oversized TFTP read/write request packets via UDP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the target machine where the vulnerable ExtraPuTTY TFTP server is running.
- The attacker needs to be on the network or have network access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted TFTP packet with a large string in place of the filename.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a large amount of junk data in a TFTP read or write request.
- The issue affects ExtraPuTTY versions v029_RC2 and v0.30 r15.
- The exploit code is provided, allowing an attacker to quickly create a large payload.
- The exploit sends an initial valid TFTP request followed by a malicious request with an oversized string.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the server attempts to process an oversized packet.
