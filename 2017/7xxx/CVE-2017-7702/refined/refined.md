Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7702:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the WBXML dissector in Wireshark. Specifically, a malformed WBXML packet can trigger an infinite loop within the dissector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Infinite Loop:** The core vulnerability is an infinite loop within the WBXML dissector when processing a crafted, malformed packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop causes excessive CPU resource consumption, effectively leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The excessive CPU usage can impact the performance of the system running Wireshark.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed WBXML packet onto the network being monitored by Wireshark.
*   **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can provide a user with a malicious packet capture file containing the malformed WBXML packet, leading to the vulnerability being triggered when the user opens the file in Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs the ability to inject packets onto a network being monitored by a vulnerable Wireshark instance or access to the capture file.
*   **Malicious File Delivery:** An attacker can deliver a malformed packet as a pcap file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Otto Airamo and Antti Levom√§ki from Forcepoint.
*   The issue is tracked as Wireshark issues 13477 and 13796
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.7 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.13.
*   The fix is included in Wireshark versions 2.2.8, 2.0.14, and later.
* The vulnerability can lead to large memory usage
