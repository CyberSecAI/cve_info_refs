                 CVE-2017-1000365

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2014-9940

    A use-after-free flaw in the voltage and current regulator driver
    could allow a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially
    escalate privileges.

CVE-2017-7346

    Li Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual GPUs does
    not properly check user-controlled values in the
    vmw_surface_define_ioctl() functions for upper limits. A local user
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-7482

    Shi Lei discovered that RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code does
    not properly verify metadata, leading to information disclosure,
    denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-7533

    Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao discovered a race condition between inotify
    events and VFS rename operations allowing an unprivileged local
    attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

CVE-2017-7541

    A buffer overflow flaw in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n PCIe SoftMAC WLAN
    driver could allow a local user to cause kernel memory corruption,
    leading to a denial of service or potentially privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-7542

    An integer overflow vulnerability in the ip6_find_1stfragopt()
    function was found allowing a local attacker with privileges to open
    raw sockets to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-7889

    Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler reported that the mm subsystem does
    not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection mechanism,
    allowing a local attacker with access to /dev/mem to obtain
    sensitive information or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-9605

    Murray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual
    GPUs does not properly initialize memory, potentially allowing a
    local attacker to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
    kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.

CVE-2017-10911 / XSA-216

    Anthony Perard of Citrix discovered an information leak flaw in Xen
    blkif response handling, allowing a malicious unprivileged guest to
    obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.

CVE-2017-11176

    It was discovered that the mq_notify() function does not set the
    sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. An attacker
    can take advantage of this flaw during a userspace close of a
    Netlink socket to cause a denial of service or potentially cause
    other impact.

CVE-2017-1000363

    Roee Hay reported that the lp driver does not properly bounds-check
    passed arguments, allowing a local attacker with write access to the
    kernel command line arguments to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000365

    It was discovered that argument and environment pointers are not
    taken properly into account to the imposed size restrictions on
    arguments and environmental strings passed through
    RLIMIT_STACK/RLIMIT_INFINITY. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw in conjunction with other flaws to execute arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* An use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel which enables a race condition in the L2TPv3 IP Encapsulation feature. A local user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges or crash the system. (CVE-2016-10200, Important)
* A flaw was found that can be triggered in keyring\_search\_iterator in keyring.c if type->match is NULL. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges. (CVE-2017-2647, Important)
* It was found that the NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel did not properly validate layout type when processing NFSv4 pNFS LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO operands. A remote attacker could use this flaw to soft-lockup the system and thus cause denial of service. (CVE-2017-8797, Important)

This update also fixes multiple Moderate and Low impact security issues:

* CVE-2015-8839, CVE-2015-8970, CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-7042, CVE-2016-7097, CVE-2016-8645, CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-9588, CVE-2016-9806, CVE-2016-10088, CVE-2016-10147, CVE-2017-2596, CVE-2017-2671, CVE-2017-5970, CVE-2017-6001, CVE-2017-6951, CVE-2017-7187, CVE-2017-7616, CVE-2017-7889, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9074, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9075, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9076, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9077, CVE-2017-9242, CVE-2014-7970, CVE-2014-7975, CVE-2016-6213, CVE-2016-9604, CVE-2016-9685

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

After installing kernel-rt/tuned/rt-tests/qemu-kvm-rhev/libvirt/dpdk/openvswitch, and isolate cores, host kernel panic in one of my hosts.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 3.10.0-648.rt56.566.el7.x86_64   How reproducible: Hit this issue 1 time.  Steps to Reproduce: 1.Install rhel7.4 host 2.Install kernel-rt and virt related packages, including: tuned-2.8.0-1.el7.noarch rt-tests-1.0-10.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-rhev-2.9.0-0.el7.patchwork201703291116.x86_64 libvirt-daemon-3.2.0-2.el7.x86_64  3. Reboot host  4. Install dpdk/openvswitch dpdk-16.11-4.el7fdp.x86_64 openvswitch-2.6.1-15.git20161206.el7fdp.x86_64  5. Add hugepage/iommu to kernel line # cat /etc/default/grub ... GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="crashkernel=auto rd.lvm.lv=rhel_dell-per730-11/root rd.lvm.lv=rhel_dell-per730-11/swap console=ttyS0,115200n81 default_hugepagesz=1G iommu=pt intel_iommu=on"  6. Isolate cores # cat /etc/tuned/realtime-virtual-host-variables.conf isolated_cores=2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,19,17,16,15  # tuned-adm profile realtime-virtual-host  7. Then host hang with kernel panic, please see[1]   8. Reboot host in beaker button, then host will works well.

And I tested below version about 3 times currently, hit this issue 1 time.  Versions: kernel-rt-3.10.0-664.rt56.583.el7.  But this time I didn't open the console before hang, so can not provide the detail error info.  I'll keep monitoring console in next testings.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c6)  Luiz Capitulino    2017-05-16 17:30:29 UTC  ``` I have a few questions:  - Do you start ovs before activating the profile? If yes, do you assigned fifo priority to the PMD threads?  - Is this always reproduced when activating the profile or is it reproduced at different times?  - Are you able to reproduce this with tuned-2.8.0-2.el7 or later?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c8)  Pei Zhang    2017-05-17 10:57:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Luiz Capitulino from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c6)) > I have a few questions: >  > - Do you start ovs before activating the profile?

Only install the ovs/dpdk packages for next testing.  > - Is this always reproduced when activating the profile or is it reproduced > at different times?  Currently, I hit this host kernel crash only one time. In my latest kvm-rt related testing, I didn't hit this issue anymore. Besides hit hang issue[[Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c5)] one time.   > - Are you able to reproduce this with tuned-2.8.0-2.el7 or later?  In my daily testing, I already tested with tuned-2.8.0-2.el7/tuned-2.8.0-3.el7.noarch, didn't hit this issue again.   Seems this issue is very occasionally. But seems the crash info is similar with [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1438120#c53](show_bug.cgi?id=1438120#c53 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Real Time host become hang when doing ping-pong migration over dpdk+openvswitch with setting ovs pmd 95 priority")    Best Regards, Pei   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c9)  Luiz Capitulino    2017-05-17 19:51:46 UTC  ``` Indeed! [bug 1438120 comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=1438120#c53 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Real Time host become hang when doing ping-pong migration over dpdk+openvswitch with setting ovs pmd 95 priority") is precisely the same issue and it's nice you got a good vmcore! Would you mind to post that info here too?  So, what seems to be happening here is:  1. Something in user-space in changing testpmd pinning and this code path is executed:  sched_setaffinity()   set_cpu_allowed_ptr()     do_set_cpus_allowed()       set_cpus_allowed_rt()  2. set_cpus_allowed_rt() checks weight <= 1 and goes to decrement rt_nr_migratory. However, rt_nr_migratory is already zero. So the BUG_ON() triggers  Now, some important points:  - rt_nr_migratory keeps track of how many RT tasks in the runqueue can migrate to other CPUs. If rt_nr_migratory=0 it means no RT task can migrate  - nr_cpus_allowed=5 for the testpmd thread  - observe in the trace that a few pagefaults are happening in parallel to set_cpus_allowed_rt(), and those code paths are calling migrate_enable()  This points to a race with migrate_enable()/disable(), but I can't see it causing rt_nr_migratory being underflowed.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c11)  Pei Zhang    2017-05-18 04:37:11 UTC  ``` Update:  I hit the kernel panic issue again, at the first reboot after installing rt related packages.    1.Install rhel7.4 host  2.Install kernel-rt and virt related packages, including: 3.10.0-668.rt56.587.el7.x86_64 tuned-2.8.0-3.el7.noarch rt-tests-1.0-11.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-rhev-2.9.0-5.el7.x86_64 libvirt-3.2.0-5.el7.x86_64  3.

By analyzing the vmcore, I was able to find out the sequence of events that leads to the panic. And you were right, it really happens at profile activation time.  Before getting to the details, here's the reproducer:  1. Confirm that you don't have the realtime-virtual-host profile applied. You can check /proc/cmdline for this. If you do have the profile activated, change to another profile and reboot:  # tuned-adm profile desktop # reboot  2. Once you don't have realtime-virtual-host parameters in /proc/cmdline, run the following script:  #!/bin/bash  sync cd /usr/lib/tuned/realtime-virtual-host  while true; do         tuned-adm profile desktop         rm -f lapic_timer_adv_ns lapic_timer_adv_ns.cpumodel         echo activating host profile         tuned-adm profile realtime-virtual-host         echo done         sleep 1s done  This script trigs the issue for me most of the time in less than 10 minutes. However, once or twice I had to restart the machine and run the script again.  Now, the line from the tuned profile that's triggering the issue is this one:      chrt -f 1 taskset -c $1 $QEMU -enable-kvm -device pc-testdev \         -device isa-debug-exit,iobase=0xf4,iosize=0x4 \         -display none -serial stdio -device pci-testdev \         -kernel /usr/share/qemu-kvm/tscdeadline_latency.flat  \         -cpu host | grep latency | cut -f 2 -d ":" > $dir/out  This is from the run-tscdeadline-latency.sh script executed by the realtime-virtual-host profile. That explains why you had to reprovision the machine to reproduce this and also why I wasn't being able to reproduce it before: run-tscdeadline-latency.sh implements caching and it should execute only once on a system (the reproducer above remove the caching files, forcing the script to execute on every run).  I still don't know what causes this. I'm building a debug kernel to gather more information.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c20)  Pei Zhang    2017-05-24 01:01:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Luiz Capitulino from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c19)) > I was able to create a reproducer for this issue! >  > By analyzing the vmcore, I was able to find out the sequence of events that > leads to the panic.

This upstream commit:    commit 55c041cf3750894df6f304ad0489c777e27402e7   Author: Sebastian Andrzej Siewior <bigeasy>   Date:   Thu Jan 21 15:58:56 2016 +0100        sched: fixup migrate disable (all tasks were bound to CPU0)  Which was backported via [bug 1423432](show_bug.cgi?id=1423432 "CLOSED NOTABUG - Consider update migrate_disable/enable on kernel-rt"), replaces all p->nr_cpus_allowed usage to a function called tsk_nr_cpus_allowed(). This function returns 1 when migration is disabled (meaning, "one CPU allowed").  Now, take a look at what is done in inc_rt_migration(): rt_nr_migratory will only get updated when nr_cpus_allowed > 1. The following case should be possible:  1. rt_nr_migratory=0  2. Migration is disabled in some code path (eg. pagefault)  3. inc_rt_migration() is called. rt_nr_migratory increment is skipped    since tsk_nr_cpus_allowed() will return 1  4. Migration is enabled  5. set_cpus_allowed_rt() is called from sched_setaffinity() code path  6. set_cpus_allowed_rt() should get weight=1 and tsk_nr_cpus_allowed()    should return > 1 since migration is now enabled  7. BUG_ON() triggers  Note that this problem should also be present on upstream, since the code is the same. However, upstream doesn't have the BUG_ON() anymore so the problem is less severe (probably rt_nr_migratory gets unbalanced).  I guess the solution is just to change set_cpus_allowed_rt() to check p->nr_cpus_allowed directly instead of using tsk_nr_cpus_allowed(). But this is a discussion to have on upstream.  For downstream, I think the best action right now is to revert the series for [bug 1423432](show_bug.cgi?id=1423432 "CLOSED NOTABUG - Consider update migrate_disable/enable on kernel-rt").  I'll find a way to show that the problem exists on upstream and post my patch there. Then, once it's accepted or another solution recommended, we can backport the series for [bug 1423432](show_bug.cgi?id=1423432 "CLOSED NOTABUG - Consider update migrate_disable/enable on kernel-rt") along with the fix for this issue.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c28)  Luiz Capitulino    2017-05-26 15:32:39 UTC  ``` Daniel is taking up this work, so I'm re-assining this to him.

I think the problem with upstream commit 55c041c is that it's not all places that you can replace p->nr_cpus_allowed with tsk_nr_cpus_allowed(). inc_rt_migration() and dec_rt_migration() is one of those places, there could be more.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c32)  Daniel Bristot de Oliveira    2017-06-06 08:46:12 UTC  ``` Hi Luiz,  By only using p->nr_cpus_allowed, your patch completely ignores that the migrate_disable/enable actions. Although in the past this was used, at that time, the migrated disable also used to change the cpumask of tasks. But that is not true anymore. So I do not believe that that is the best solution for this bug.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c33)  Daniel Bristot de Oliveira    2017-06-06 13:27:25 UTC  ``` Hi Pei,  Could you please collect data using the following kernel:  <https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/taskinfo?taskID=13351615>  ?  It does not aim to fix the problem but to collect data about the problem.  I added some trace_printks and a BUG_ON() in the  dec_rt_migration(), so we can get the problem earlier.  Before starting the test, please, run the following commands:  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events | grep setaff  > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_event  # sysctl -w kernel.ftrace_dump_on_oops=1  This will generate a VMCORE, please ensure that I can download the vmcore... I couldn't download the last one (403 Forbidden).  Finally, I tried to reproduce the problem locally, but the steps to reproduce did not drive me to the crash. Is there anything else I should do?  Thanks in advance.  -- Daniel   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c34)  Luiz Capitulino    2017-06-06 13:45:57 UTC  ``` Daniel,  I'll explain my reasioning for the fix below. However, as this issue is a high severity regression and as we're late in the snapshot phase, I think the best action for this BZ right now is to revert the series for [bug 1423432](show_bug.cgi?id=1423432 "CLOSED NOTABUG - Consider update migrate_disable/enable on kernel-rt") and redo the backport (along with the fix for this issue) for 7.5 or 7.4.z. Otherwise, we risk shipping 7.4 with this issue.  Regarding the fix, my thinking is: the semantics for tsk_nr_cpus_allowed(p) is "if migration is enabled, the number of CPUs this task can migrate to is nr_cpus_allowed. If migrate is disabled this task can't migrate to another CPU". The problem here is that this semantics doesn't apply to inc_rt_migration() and dec_rt_migration(), since I _guess_ those functions do global accounting of migratable tasks and are not affected by individual tasks being unable to be migrated in a short period of time.  But of course, I could be wrong.   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1441552#c35)  Daniel Bristot de Oliveira    2017-06-06 14:36:21 UTC  ``` Luis,  I am considering revert the other BZ, as we talked yesterday.

mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing readsNotice: this object is not reachable from any branch.
commit a4866aa812518ed1a37d8ea0c881dc946409de94 upstream.
Under CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:
usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)
This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**".

The reported stacktraces are symptoms of the bug, not the reason. The reason is that there's a process mdX_raid5 in an infinite loop, consuming 100% CPU.  The function handle_stripe is called for a stripe: These are the debugging prints: handling stripe 96, state=0x1401 cnt=1, pd_idx=4, qd_idx=-1 , check:0, reconstruct:6 locked=1 uptodate=5 to_read=0 to_write=0 failed=3 failed_num=4,3  The device failed, so this branch is entered: if (s.failed > conf->max_degraded || s.log_failed) { // s.failed == 3, conf->max_degraded == 1, s.log_failed == 0 the branch sets:         sh->check_state = 0;         sh->reconstruct_state = 0;  Next, we enter this branch (s.to_write is zero, so it does nothing): if (!sh->reconstruct_state && !sh->check_state && !sh->log_io) {         if (!r5c_is_writeback(conf->log)) {                 if (s.to_write)       //  s.to_write == 0  Next, we enter this branch: if (s.expanded && test_bit(STRIPE_EXPANDING, &sh->state) && !sh->reconstruct_state) {         schedule_reconstruction(sh, &s, 1, 1);         schedule_reconstruction ends with s->locked == 2, s->ops_request == (1 << STRIPE_OP_RECONSTRUCT)  Next, we enter this branch: if (s.ops_request)         raid_run_ops(sh, s.ops_request);         raid_run_ops calls ops_run_reconstruct5         ops_run_reconstruct5 calls async_xor with the callback ops_complete_reconstruct (the xor operation is actually synchronous and the callback is called immediatelly because system doesn't have dedicated xor hardware)         ops_complete_reconstruct is called with sh->sector==96, sh->state==0x1401, sh->reconstruct_state==3         ops_complete_reconstruct calls set_bit(STRIPE_HANDLE, &sh->state); at the end and it just submits the stripe back to stripe_handle  stripe_handle is called with the same stripe again and goes exactly the same way as before. The process consumes 100% CPU in a loop, repeatedly recalculating parity for the same stripe.  I found out that this patch fixes it - if we clear the bit STRIPE_EXPANDING, we won't go to the branch that calles schedule_reconstruction and the infinite loop won't happen. However, the code is so messy that only the author can tell if this patch is correct or not. --- rhel7.orig/drivers/md/raid5.c +++ rhel7/drivers/md/raid5.c @@ -4517,6 +4517,7 @@ static void handle_stripe(struct stripe_                         handle_failed_stripe(conf, sh, &s, disks, &s.return_bi);                 if (s.syncing + s.replacing)                         handle_failed_sync(conf, sh, &s); +               clear_bit(STRIPE_EXPANDING, &sh->state);         }          /* Now we check to see if any write operations have recently  Generally, the code has very poor quality and it is unverifiable. There's one big 390-line function handle_stripe that does all possible operations that can be done on a stripe - it doesn't have straight control flow, the action that the function does is determined by a large number of bit flags. It is impossible to verify that it handles device failure correctly in all states and that there are no more infinite loops like this.  Properly, handle_stripe should be broken to smaller functions where each function does just one thing and it should use callbacks, not bit flags, to determine what operation should be done next - then, the sequence of operations on a stripe could be understood and verified.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c6)  Alasdair Kergon     2017-05-30 14:58:43 UTC  ``` Neil - have you seen anything like this upstream?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c8)  Heinz Mauelshagen    2017-05-30 17:18:31 UTC  ``` Added upstream commit 3719f4bc5441cb5f29ad4beb91ccaa6b234ea8e1 to lvm2 rejecting changing number of stripes on single core until MD kernel fix available.

They are all accesible when we add/remove stripes.  I tried your supend check move in md_check_recovery as of "4.11.2: reshape raid5 -> raid6 atop bcache deadlocks at start on md_attr_store / raid5_make_request" and it fixes the deadlock as of this bz.

There's various examples deadlocking on single core machines.

On SMP systems, the second call to raid5_ctr happens before raid5d starts doing the actual reshape, so the reshape sees all 5 devices and succeeds. On single-core systems, raid5d runs before the userspace reloads the table the second time with all five devices, so raid5d sees only two devices (expecting five) and fails the whole array.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c17)  Heinz Mauelshagen    2017-05-31 21:27:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mikulas Patocka from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c15)) > I don't know if this bug is present in the upstream kernel or not because in > the upstream kernel (since 4.12-rc) the raid subsystem crashes on BUG in > lib/percpu-refcount.c:192.

Initial tests show it runs fine without the conditionals, but...  From dm, we allow secondary resumes on already resumed raid sets to attempt to restore any previously failed component devices. IOW: suspend and resumed aren't balanced to allow for this functionality. Though any N-th (N > 1) resume will bail out decrementing mddev->suspended, a followup suspend won't work on the same mddev because that int variable turned negative. Could change logic in raid_resume() based on existing dm-raid resume flag handling the inbalance to avoid accessing mddev->suspended.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c25)  Heinz Mauelshagen    2017-06-01 17:42:48 UTC  ``` Pushing to 7.5 to have proper md fixes to address the single core deadlock.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c26)  Heinz Mauelshagen    2017-06-01 21:23:22 UTC  ``` Neil,  I propose to have an md api/code version to associate features/API (bugs) with it as we do in dm (for instance to not allow reshape on single core if md version < x).

According to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c18), there is some problem with a second ctr call not retrieving the correct metadata. Maybe you are expecting the metadata to be written, and then reloaded, all while the array is suspended?  Why would you even reload the metadata - don't you have an internal copy.

Call md_update_sb, making sure you hold the mddev_lock().  I've looked some more at your use of mddev_suspend/resume and the fact that you resume, and then suspend, inside rs_start_reshape() bothers me.

I think I might be missing something.  dm has an active and inactive table slot to allow for mapping switches on open devices and either causes constructor calls.  For dm-raid we always read in superblocks from disk processing them.  Thus, the active one holding the table for the current raid device has to be suspended leaving up-to-date superblocks behind.  The raid_ctr() call for the inactive table read the superblocks in and prepares them for reshape (new_layout/delta_disk/...) setting recovery to frozen. This does not start the reshape until preresume.  >  > If there is a place where you need the metadata to be written synchronously > for correct operation, then you should write it synchronously.

Yes, thanks.   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c41)  NeilBrown    2017-06-18 22:45:14 UTC  ``` > Doing that already.  Ah yes, the rs_update_sbs() calls.  They do seem to do the right thing, but I don't have a clear picture of the sequencing so I cannot be sure.  > dm has an active and inactive table slot to allow for mapping switches on open devices  Ahh... so when rs_start_reshape() is called, is that md array always an "inactive table" - so no I/O could possibly want to go through it?  Any io to the DM device will go through the separate "active table"?  That means you don't need to worry about mem-alloc deadlocks like md does. So I think there should be no need at all to resume/suspend in rs_start_reshape().  Does it cause any problem to remove the mddev_resume()/mddev_suspend() from rs_start_reshape()?   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c42)  Rafael Aquini    2017-06-19 16:57:26 UTC  ``` Patch(es) committed on kernel repository and an interim kernel build is undergoing testing   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c44)  Jonathan Earl Brassow    2017-06-19 18:05:43 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1442137](show_bug.cgi?id=1442137 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - RAID RESHAPE: deadlock when attempting striped raid image addition on single core") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c45)  Rafael Aquini    2017-06-20 14:57:42 UTC  ``` Patch(es) available on kernel-3.10.0-683.el7   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=1443999#c48)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-02 06:10:41 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2077)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* An use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel which enables a race condition in the L2TPv3 IP Encapsulation feature. A local user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges or crash the system. (CVE-2016-10200, Important)
* A flaw was found that can be triggered in keyring\_search\_iterator in keyring.c if type->match is NULL. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges. (CVE-2017-2647, Important)
* It was found that the NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel did not properly validate layout type when processing NFSv4 pNFS LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO operands. A remote attacker could use this flaw to soft-lockup the system and thus cause denial of service. (CVE-2017-8797, Important)

This update also fixes multiple Moderate and Low impact security issues:

* CVE-2015-8839, CVE-2015-8970, CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-7042, CVE-2016-7097, CVE-2016-8645, CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-9588, CVE-2016-9806, CVE-2016-10088, CVE-2016-10147, CVE-2017-2596, CVE-2017-2671, CVE-2017-5970, CVE-2017-6001, CVE-2017-6951, CVE-2017-7187, CVE-2017-7616, CVE-2017-7889, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9074, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9075, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9076, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-9077, CVE-2017-9242, CVE-2014-7970, CVE-2014-7975, CVE-2016-6213, CVE-2016-9604, CVE-2016-9685

Documentation for these issues is available from the Release Notes document linked from the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Igor Redko (Virtuozzo) and Andrey Ryabinin (Virtuozzo) for reporting CVE-2017-2647; Igor Redko (Virtuozzo) and Vasily Averin (Virtuozzo) for reporting CVE-2015-8970; Marco Grassi for reporting CVE-2016-8645; and Dmitry Vyukov (Google Inc.) for reporting CVE-2017-2596.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2669)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel, present since v3.14-rc1 through v4.12. The race happens between threads of inotify\_handle\_event() and vfs\_rename() while running the rename operation against the same file. As a result of the race the next slab data or the slab's free list pointer can be corrupted with attacker-controlled data, which may lead to the privilege escalation. (CVE-2017-7533, Important)
* It was found that the NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel did not properly validate layout type when processing NFSv4 pNFS LAYOUTGET and GETDEVICEINFO operands. A remote attacker could use this flaw to soft-lockup the system and thus cause denial of service. (CVE-2017-8797, Important)

This update also fixes multiple Moderate and Low impact security issues:

CVE-2017-8797 CVE-2015-8839 CVE-2016-9576 CVE-2016-7042 CVE-2016-7097 CVE-2016-8645 CVE-2016-9576 CVE-2016-9806 CVE-2016-10088 CVE-2017-2671 CVE-2017-5970 CVE-2017-6001 CVE-2017-6951 CVE-2017-7187 CVE-2017-7889 CVE-2017-8890 CVE-2017-9074 CVE-2017-8890 CVE-2017-9075 CVE-2017-8890 CVE-2017-9076 CVE-2017-8890 CVE-2017-9077 CVE-2016-9604 CVE-2016-9685

Documentation for these issues are available from the Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Leilei Lin (Alibaba Group), Fan Wu (The University of Hong Kong), and Shixiong Zhao (The University of Hong Kong) for reporting CVE-2017-7533 and Marco Grassi for reporting CVE-2016-8645. The CVE-2016-7042 issue was discovered by Ondrej Kozina (Red Hat); the CVE-2016-7097 issue was discovered by Andreas Gruenbacher (Red Hat) and Jan Kara (SUSE); the CVE-2016-9604 issue was discovered by David Howells (Red Hat); and the CVE-2016-9685 issue was discovered by Qian Cai (Red Hat).

## Solution

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1854)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, PowerPC)
* kernel: net/packet: overflow in check for priv area size (CVE-2017-7308)
* kernel: AIO interface didn't use rw\_verify\_area() for checking mandatory locking on files and size of access (CVE-2012-6701)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Null pointer dereference via keyctl (CVE-2016-8650)
* kernel: ping socket / AF\_LLC connect() sin\_family race (CVE-2017-2671)
* kernel: Race condition between multiple sys\_perf\_event\_open() calls (CVE-2017-6001)
* kernel: Incorrect error handling in the set\_mempolicy and mbind compat syscalls in mm/mempolicy.c (CVE-2017-7616)
* kernel: mm subsystem does not properly enforce the CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM protection mechanism (CVE-2017-7889)
* kernel: Double free in the inet\_csk\_clone\_lock function in net/ipv4/inet\_connection\_sock.c (CVE-2017-8890)
* kernel: net: sctp\_v6\_create\_accept\_sk function mishandles inheritance (CVE-2017-9075)
* kernel: net: IPv6 DCCP implementation mishandles inheritance (CVE-2017-9076)
* kernel: net: tcp\_v6\_syn\_recv\_sock function mishandles inheritance (CVE-2017-9077)
* kernel: memory leak when merging buffers in SCSI IO vectors (CVE-2017-12190)
* kernel: vfs: BUG in truncate\_inode\_pages\_range() and fuse client (CVE-2017-15121)
* kernel: Race condition in drivers/md/dm.c:dm\_get\_from\_kobject() allows local users to cause a denial of service (CVE-2017-18203)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in net/dccp/output.c:dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in net/sctp/sm\_make\_chunk.c:\_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting CVE-2018-3639; Vitaly Mayatskih for reporting CVE-2017-12190; and Evgenii Shatokhin (Virtuozzo Team) for reporting CVE-2018-1130. The CVE-2017-15121 issue was discovered by Miklos Szeredi (Red Hat).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c0)  Robb Manes    2017-04-24 19:58:09 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When booting with ipv6.disable=1, vxlan will fail to initialize with the error "vxlan: Cannot bind port 4789, err=-97" which is EAFNOSUPPORT.  This is normally fine, except that should this IPv6 check fail due to EAFNOSUPPORT on the first call of __vxlan_sock_add(), the second non-IPv6 call of __vxlan_sock_add() will not occur.  This is due to the check done in vxlan_add_sock():  When __vxlan_add_sock() will return failure due to EAFNOSUPPORT via vxlan_sock_add->__vxlan_sock_add->vxlan_create_sock->udp_sock_create() refusing the AF_INET6 address, the first check fails and the second will never retry, so no vxlan socket is made.  static int vxlan_sock_add(struct vxlan_dev *vxlan) {         bool ipv6 = vxlan->flags & VXLAN_F_IPV6;         bool metadata = vxlan->flags & VXLAN_F_COLLECT_METADATA;         int ret = 0;           RCU_INIT_POINTER(vxlan->vn4_sock, NULL); #if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)         RCU_INIT_POINTER(vxlan->vn6_sock, NULL);         if (ipv6 || metadata)                 ret = __vxlan_sock_add(vxlan, true); #endif         if ((!ret || ret == -EAFNOSUPPORT) && (!ipv6 || metadata))                 ret = __vxlan_sock_add(vxlan, false);         if (ret < 0)                  vxlan_sock_release(vxlan);         return ret;  }  Fix, as authored by Marcelo Leitner, is as below:  diff --git a/drivers/net/vxlan.c b/drivers/net/vxlan.c index ebc98bb..2dfeda8 100644 --- a/drivers/net/vxlan.c +++ b/drivers/net/vxlan.c @@ -2832,7 +2832,7 @@ static int vxlan_sock_add(struct vxlan_dev *vxlan)         if (ipv6 || metadata)                 ret = __vxlan_sock_add(vxlan, true);  #endif -       if (!ret && (!ipv6 || metadata)) +       if ((!ret || ret == -EAFNOSUPPORT) && (!ipv6 || metadata))                 ret = __vxlan_sock_add(vxlan, false);         if (ret < 0)                 vxlan_sock_release(vxlan);  We now track to see if EAFNOSUPPORT is returned, and if it is we will fall through to an IPv4 socket using __vxlan_sock_add().  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Occurs in latest net-next and affects RHEL7 by proxy.  How reproducible: Every time.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure vxlan tunnel (I used an OVS bridge) on a host and attach a tap or veth to it: 	# ovs-vsctl add-br vxlan-br vx1 	# ovs-vsctl add-port vxlan-br vx1 -- set interface vx1 type=vxlan options:remote_ip=192.168.222.21 	# ovs-vsctl add-port vxlan-br $TAP/VETH 2. Attach a seperate network to the IP of the tap or veth device. 3. Reboot with ipv6.disable=1 as a command line option, vxlan tunnel will no longer function.  Actual results: vxlan socket is not created for IPv4 despite only IPv6 being disabled  Expected results: Only IPv6 socket should not be created, IPv4 socket should also be made.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c1)  Robb Manes    2017-04-24 20:13:56 UTC  ``` Valid workaround is to remove ipv6.disable=1, which will open both sockets.  Full reproduction steps:  - Configure two individual hosts on the same subnet, using 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3 as an example. - On each host (two separate hosts):   - Add an internal OpenVSwitch bridge to the host:     # ovs-vsctl add-br br-int   - Add a VXLAN port to the br-int device with the remote_ip address the peer system:     # ovs-vsctl add-port br-int vx1 -- set interface vx1 type=vxlan options:remote_ip=192.168.1.2       ||OR||     # ovs-vsctl add-port br-int vx1 -- set interface vx1 type=vxlan options:remote_ip=192.168.1.3   - Add a veth pair to the OVS bridge and attach one end to the bridge, and provide it with a separate network address (10.10.10.2 and 10.10.10.3 on each host used in this example):     # ip link set type veth     # ip link set veth0 up     # ip link set veth1 up     # ovs-vsctl add-port br-int veth1     # ip addr add 10.10.10.2/24 dev veth0       ||OR||     # ip addr add 10.10.10.3/24 dev veth0  Both sides should be able to ping 10.10.10.* devices on the vxlan tunnel to their respective peer.  After adding ipv6.disable=1 to the /etc/sysconfig/grub line "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX" rebuild GRUB2 configuration: - grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg  Reboot, and VXLAN should no longer function.  Applying the patch in #1 will resolve the problem.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c2)  Marcelo Ricardo Leitner    2017-04-24 20:22:40 UTC  ``` Hi Jiri. I believe this is a follow-up for b1be00a6c39f ("vxlan: support both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets in a single vxlan device").  The patch above will cause it log an error for ipv6 socket while it will be silent for ipv4 if it works. That doesn't seem very friendly, but the admin did disable ipv6 for that interface, so maybe that's okay.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c3)  Jiri Benc    2017-04-27 19:29:14 UTC  ``` Patches submitted upstream:  <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/756113/> <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/756114/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c5)  Ben Bennett    2017-05-08 18:42:59 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1437778](show_bug.cgi?id=1437778 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Problems in ovs configuration after uninstall and install on Azure") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c7)  Rafael Aquini    2017-05-17 13:28:03 UTC  ``` Patch(es) committed on kernel repository and an interim kernel build is undergoing testing   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c9)  Rafael Aquini    2017-05-18 13:45:20 UTC  ``` Patch(es) available on kernel-3.10.0-668.el7   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c11)  Paolo Abeni    2017-05-19 13:57:21 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1452611](show_bug.cgi?id=1452611) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c13)  Jan Tluka    2017-05-19 16:20:35 UTC  ``` Reproduced on 3.10.0-632.el7 kernel using script in [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1445054#c1).

Message-ID: <20170416202538.GA12165@grsecurity.net>

Subject: Silently (or obliviously) partially-fixed CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM bypass

Hi all,

I wanted to provide some small notice of upstream kernel developers silently
or obliviously partially fixing a CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM bypass which explicitly has
never been possible in grsecurity in the past 15 years.  I say this because the commit
message makes no mention of this partially fixing a CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM bypass (and I
suppose a Secure Boot bypass, but what isn't these days?), and similarly makes no
mentions of the modifications it makes to the write side.  CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM exists
to prevent userland from directly modifying kernel memory, yet the kernel will happily
make slab allocations in allowed regions below 1MB.  CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM explicitly
allowed both reads and writes to these allocations.  As noted, the commit below doesn't
fix the mmap side.

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a4866aa812518ed1a37d8ea0c881dc946409de94>

Feel free to look at GRKERNSEC_KMEM code going back to 2002 in our 2.4.20
patch, or when it changed in 2003 for 2.4.21, or this explicit hunk, comment and
all, that's been around ever since CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM was added in 2008:

+#ifdef CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_KMEM
+       /* throw out everything else below 1MB */
+       if (pagenr <= 256)
+               return 0;
+#endif

While I'm here, some more VMAP_STACK fallout (DoS/potential memory corruption,
adding to the dozen or so posted earlier):

mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing readsUnder CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:
usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)
This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.

memory). ([CVE-2017-14156](/security/CVE-2017-14156))

ChunYu Wang discovered that the iSCSI transport implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate data structures. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-14489](/security/CVE-2017-14489))

James Patrick-Evans discovered a race condition in the LEGO USB Infrared

Tower driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15102](/security/CVE-2017-15102))

ChunYu Wang discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code, ([CVE-2017-15115](/security/CVE-2017-15115))

It was discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux kernel did

not properly handle NULL payloads with non-zero length values. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-15274](/security/CVE-2017-15274))

It was discovered that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol (BNEP)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not validate the type of socket

passed in the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(). A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN

privilege could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15868](/security/CVE-2017-15868))

Andrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the USB

serial console driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16525](/security/CVE-2017-16525))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17806](/security/CVE-2017-17806))

Denys Fedoryshchenko discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

netfilter xt\_TCPMSS filter of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18017](/security/CVE-2017-18017))

Gareth Evans discovered that the shm IPC subsystem in the Linux kernel did

not properly restrict mapping page zero. A local privileged attacker could

use this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-5669](/security/CVE-2017-5669))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1448170#c0)  Dave Wysochanski    2017-05-04 16:40:48 UTC  ``` Description of problem: There's a definite over-the-wire change in RHEL6.9 when a RPC TCP transport goes idle, the connection drops, and then is re-established.  If the connection drops, then a burst of RPC commands get triggered, they all seem to be able to initiate the TCP connect logic, which results in a burst of SYN packets over the wire.  Prior to RHEL6.9 in RHEL6.8 this does not occur.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible: Easy from what I can tell  Steps to Reproduce: 0. On NFS client, start tcpdump to NFS server tcpdump -i eth0 -w /tmp/tcpdump2.pcap host 192.168.122.35 &  1. On NFS client, mount NFS share (I used RHEL6.8 NFS server) mount -t nfs -overs=3 192.168.122.35:/exports/test /mnt/test  2. On NFS client, let the share go idle so the TCP connection drops sleep 600  3. On NFS client, do something that generates multiple RPC tasks in parallel for i in $(seq 0 50); do touch /mnt/test/test-file-$i.bin & done  4. Kill tcpdump kill %1  5. Check tcpdump for presence of multiple SYN packets from the NFS client in less than one second. tshark -ntad -r /tmp/tcpdump2.pcap -R 'tcp.flags.syn == 1'  Actual results: A burst of TCP SYN packets from the NFS client  [root@rhel6u9-node1 ~]# uname -r 2.6.32-696.el6.x86_64 [root@rhel6u9-node1 ~]# tshark -ntad -r /tmp/tcpdump2.pcap -R 'tcp.flags.syn == 1' Running as user "root" and group "root".

The following patch is believed to fix this problem but I've not confirmed yet.  commit 0fdea1e8a2853f79d39b8555cc9de16a7e0ab26f Author: Trond Myklebust <trond.myklebust> Date:   Wed Sep 16 23:43:17 2015 -0400      SUNRPC: Ensure that we wait for connections to complete before retrying          Commit 718ba5b87343, moved the responsibility for unlocking the socket to     xs_tcp_setup_socket, meaning that the socket will be unlocked before we     know that it has finished trying to connect. The following patch is based on     an initial patch by Russell King to ensure that we delay clearing the     XPRT_CONNECTING flag until we either know that we failed to initiate     a connection attempt, or the connection attempt itself failed.          Fixes: 718ba5b87343 ("SUNRPC: Add helpers to prevent socket create from racing")     Reported-by: Russell King <linux.org.uk>     Reported-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel.org.uk>     Tested-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel.org.uk>     Tested-by: Benjamin Coddington <bcodding>     Signed-off-by: Trond Myklebust <trond.myklebust>   In addition, this may have caused a much more severe problem of a NFS DoS side-effect when iptables is enabled and an NFS server delays responding to a SYN, as the NFS client is unable to reconnect the NFS share.  I've not reproduced this effect yet, but I'm associating this bug with the customer case for now.  In the customer's tcpdump we see the SYN burst, then right afterwards see the SYN,ACK packets from the NFS server cause the NFS client to respond with "ICMP 102 Destination unreachable (Host administratively prohibited)" which indicates the iptables rules are catching the SYN,ACK coming back from the NFS server, and this bug is believed to be at least a contributing factor.  The customer can work around the problem by booting back to a 6.8 kernel or disabling iptables on the NFS client during the TCP reconnect sequence.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1448170#c2)  Dave Wysochanski    2017-05-04 17:11:07 UTC  ``` Confirmed 0fdea1e8a2853f79d39b8555cc9de16a7e0ab26f returns the reconnect behavior back to RHEL6.8 with only one SYN packet sent.

In the below trace, the NFS server responding to the second SYN, which confuses the NFS client's TCP stack.  The following sequence occurs     1) Frames 48-49: NFS client sends a duplicate SYN, the first one has Seq=3677241340, and the second one has Seq=3677245016     2) Frame 50: NFS server responds with Ack=3677241341, which is a response to the first SYN from the NFS client     3) Frame 51: NFS client responds with RST and Seq=3677241341, indicating the Ack packet in frame 50 is not understood, and the connection should be reset     4) Frame 52: NFS server responds with RST, ACK, indicating it has reset the connection     5) Frames 53-57: The sequence in 1-4 repeats     6) Frames 58-62: The sequence in 1-4 repeats ~~~  48 2017-05-17 20:24:50.684597 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 74 [TCP Port numbers reused] 815 > 2049 [SYN] Seq=3677241340 Win=14600 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=966741 TSecr=0 WS=128  49 2017-05-17 20:24:50.684833 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 74 [TCP Port numbers reused] 815 > 2049 [SYN] Seq=3677245016 Win=14600 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=966742 TSecr=0 WS=128  50 2017-05-17 20:24:50.685595 192.168.122.16 -> 192.168.122.18 TCP 74 2049 > 815 [SYN, ACK] Seq=1365940280 Ack=3677241341 Win=28960 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=1741462612 TSecr=966741 WS=128  51 2017-05-17 20:24:50.685625 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 54 815 > 2049 [RST] Seq=3677241341 Win=0 Len=0  52 2017-05-17 20:24:50.685654 192.168.122.16 -> 192.168.122.18 TCP 54 2049 > 815 [RST, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=3677245017 Win=0 Len=0  53 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689371 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 74 [TCP Port numbers reused] 815 > 2049 [SYN] Seq=3677316102 Win=14600 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=966746 TSecr=0 WS=128  54 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689452 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 74 [TCP Port numbers reused] 815 > 2049 [SYN] Seq=3677317394 Win=14600 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=966746 TSecr=0 WS=128  55 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689666 192.168.122.16 -> 192.168.122.18 TCP 74 2049 > 815 [SYN, ACK] Seq=1366005876 Ack=3677316103 Win=28960 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=1741462616 TSecr=966746 WS=128  56 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689688 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 54 815 > 2049 [RST] Seq=3677316103 Win=0 Len=0  57 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689711 192.168.122.16 -> 192.168.122.18 TCP 54 2049 > 815 [RST, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=3677317395 Win=0 Len=0  58 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689766 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 74 [TCP Port numbers reused] 815 > 2049 [SYN] Seq=3677322298 Win=14600 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=966746 TSecr=0 WS=128  59 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689826 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 74 [TCP Port numbers reused] 815 > 2049 [SYN] Seq=3677323273 Win=14600 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=966747 TSecr=0 WS=128  60 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689968 192.168.122.16 -> 192.168.122.18 TCP 74 2049 > 815 [SYN, ACK] Seq=1366010498 Ack=3677322299 Win=28960 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=1741462617 TSecr=966746 WS=128  61 2017-05-17 20:24:50.689980 192.168.122.18 -> 192.168.122.16 TCP 54 815 > 2049 [RST] Seq=3677322299 Win=0 Len=0  62 2017-05-17 20:24:50.690001 192.168.122.16 -> 192.168.122.18 TCP 54 2049 > 815 [RST, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=3677323274 Win=0 Len=0 ~~~   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=1448170#c41)  Dave Wysochanski    2017-05-19 20:44:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1280516](attachment.cgi?id=1280516 "Sample test case which tests NFSv3, v4.0, and v4.1 and checks for count of SYN packets, v2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1280516&action=edit "Sample test case which tests NFSv3, v4.0, and v4.1 and checks for count of SYN packets, v2") Sample test case which tests NFSv3, v4.0, and v4.1 and checks for count of SYN packets, v2  Changes from previous - only sleep 5 minutes is necessary for idle (see XS_IDLE_DISC_TO) - State which NFS version is   Test still fails on NFSv4.1 as it expects a disconnect after idle.  However, in 4.1 we never go idle after mount since SEQUENCE ops are sent every second to renew the clientid (still needs a good code-level explanation of difference between 4.0 and 4.1 in this regard).   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1448170#c42)  Dan Pritts    2017-05-19 20:56:53 UTC  ``` If you are looking for another test case, we're affected by this.  NFS server is Isilon.  Seen the issue on at least two RHEL6.9 clients.    Relatively easy to reproduce, client is lan-connected to isilon; disabling iptables INVALID blocking worked around the problem  Another troubled client traverses a checkpoint firewall to get to Isilon.   It's the only desktop linux user we have, so only client that traverses this firewall.   It's not entirely clear to me what's going on here, since the firewall is dropping packets from the isilon to the client - not the other way around.  Or, at least, it's not logging those drops, possible that it's dropping them for "invalid" reasons but not logging it.  I don't manage the firewall, can't look closely.    Anyway, I don't need a response, but if you want some tcpdumps let me know.   ```  [Comment 50](show_bug.cgi?id=1448170#c50)  Dan Pritts    2017-06-13 14:51:17 UTC  ``` One of my affected clients has now had the problem without the DROP INVALID rule in place.   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=1448170#c52)  Dave Wysochanski    2017-06-13 15:59:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dan Pritts from [comment #50](show_bug.cgi?id=1448170#c50)) > One of my affected clients has now had the problem without the DROP INVALID > rule in place.  Yes it's possible this bug can occur without any iptables.  The main 'signature' is that the second part of the TCP handshake (the SYN,ACK coming from the NFS server) is rejected by the NFS client, either by a iptables rule, or by the TCP stack itself, thinking the packed is invalid.  As a result the 3-way handshake won't complete and the NFS TCP connection remains down, possibly indefinitely.

That is the RHEL6.9.z kernel (backport of same patch).  This bug is for the RHEL6.10 kernel (Y-stream).  The Y-stream contains much more testing but takes longer to release.  For critical bugs that affect many customers, we have z-stream backports that release much faster but have less testing.  You're seeing the difference between the two release streams here.   ```  [Comment 64](show_bug.cgi?id=1448170#c64)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-19 04:56:31 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing reads

```
Under CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, reading System RAM through /dev/mem is
disallowed. However, on x86, the first 1MB was always allowed for BIOS
and similar things, regardless of it actually being System RAM. It was
possible for heap to end up getting allocated in low 1MB RAM, and then
read by things like x86info or dd, which would trip hardened usercopy:

usercopy: kernel memory exposure attempt detected from ffff880000090000 (dma-kmalloc-256) (4096 bytes)

This changes the x86 exception for the low 1MB by reading back zeros for
System RAM areas instead of blindly allowing them. More work is needed to
extend this to mmap, but currently mmap doesn't go through usercopy, so
hardened usercopy won't Oops the kernel.

So if I understand correctly, this will read

back zeros for any page\_is\_ram() below

1Mb, leaving only the iomem regions

allowed. But dosemu and likely other

mentioned apps like X also need an

access to BDA, which is in ram:

<http://stanislavs.org/helppc/bios_data_area.html>

We need it only for VGA pass-through

which is rarely used, but nevertheless

I wonder why not to simply disallow

the in-kernel allocators to ever touch

that region? As I understand the above

description, they currently can even

overwrite the BDA?

Sorry, something went wrong.
