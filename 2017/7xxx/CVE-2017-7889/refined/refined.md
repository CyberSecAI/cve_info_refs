Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7889:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The mm subsystem in the Linux kernel does not properly enforce the `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` protection mechanism on x86 architectures. This mechanism is designed to restrict access to kernel memory from user space through `/dev/mem`, but the vulnerability bypasses this restriction. The core issue lies in how the kernel handles memory regions below 1MB, which are traditionally reserved for BIOS code and data. The kernel fails to properly distinguish between the actual system RAM within this low 1MB region and other allowed areas, which resulted in user-space access to system RAM within that 1MB region.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect access control:** The primary weakness is the inadequate enforcement of `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM`. Specifically, the kernel incorrectly allows read access, and historically also write access, to system RAM within the first 1MB of memory when `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` is enabled.
*   **Bypass of slab-allocation restrictions:** The vulnerability allows userland processes to bypass restrictions that limit access to slab allocations within the affected memory regions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can read sensitive information from kernel memory, including the slab-allocated data in the first 1MB of system RAM.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to modify kernel memory can lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation. Although the provided text does not state this to be likely, it is not fully ruled out.
*   **Denial of Service:** By corrupting kernel memory, attackers could cause the system to crash.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access to /dev/mem:** An attacker needs to have local access to the `/dev/mem` device, which is normally only available to privileged users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system.
*   **Privileges to open /dev/mem:** The attacker must be able to open `/dev/mem`, which typically requires root or similar privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects x86 architectures.
*   The issue was discovered by Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler.
*   Patches were made to properly restrict memory access in the affected areas.
*   The fix involved modifying  `arch/x86/mm/init.c` and `drivers/char/mem.c` to correctly restrict the access to the low 1MB memory region.  The fix involved returning zeros when reading from system RAM in the low 1MB range. Additionally, a fix made writing to the low 1MB range also return errors in the drivers/char/mem.c file.
*  The fixes were implemented in the following Red Hat Security Advisories: RHSA-2017:1842, RHSA-2017:2077, RHSA-2017:2669, and RHSA-2018:1854 and also in Linux kernel version 3.10.0-693.el7
* The root cause was found to be in how the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM flag was being enforced, which allowed for heap allocations into the first 1MB of RAM and permitted user-space to read these allocations

This CVE allows local users to bypass intended memory restrictions and potentially gain sensitive information or cause denial of service and privilege escalation.
