Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7863:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a heap-based buffer overflow within the `decode_frame_common` function in `libavcodec/pngdec.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The code attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer space.
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The overflow occurs in heap memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash, due to memory corruption.
- It's also possible for attackers to have "unspecified other impact".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PNG file that exploits the flaws in `decode_frame_common`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to provide a malicious PNG file to a system that uses the vulnerable `libav` library.
- No specific position within the system seems to be needed.
