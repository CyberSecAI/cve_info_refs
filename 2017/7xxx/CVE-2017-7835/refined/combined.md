| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

Jake Archibald at google noticed some weird behavior. See this demo:
<https://firefox-redirect-bug.glitch.me/>
Source code is at:
<https://glitch.com/edit/#!/firefox-redirect-bug?path=public/script.js:1:0>
In this case he is trying to fail a fetch() call by redirecting from an https:// origin to an http:// origin. This does produce the failure message:
Blocked loading mixed active content “<http://example.com/>”
But the fetch() succeeds and the 302 response is returned instead.
I instrumented FetchDriver a bit and its actually not seeing an AsyncOnChannelRedirect() call. Instead its just getting an OnStartRequest() with a channel with a successful mStatus.
Christoph, is this a problem with our AsyncOpen2() security checks? Or is it possible an http cache issue, Honza?
I'm marking this a secure bug since Jake told me that some sites include private information in redirects that should not be exposed to scripts.

In the short term I can fix this by failing the fetch if we get OnStartRequest with a redirect status when redirect mode is not manual.

Andrew, this patch makes us fail any unexpected 30x responses from necko at the FetchDriver. In general we should not see these, but it seems they can happen when the redirect is failed for things like mixed content.Assignee: nobody → bkellyStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

The problem with fixing this at the Fetch API layer, though, is that other necko consumers may have the same problem. It seems XHR probably needs to be fixed as well.

Okay, so we expose the content of a redirect when it goes from HTTPS to HTTP? That is somewhat problematic given <https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#atomic-http-redirect-handling>. The site would first need to be XSS'd successfully though before an attacker could steal such a token and the site would need to redirect to an HTTP service which seems less likely and would already reveal the token to network attackers as well. Unless I'm missing something I don't think this is severe.Flags: needinfo?(annevk)

At first, I was thinking it can't be a problem for AsyncOpen2(), since I was thinking we have tests for that. Now I looked at the code and compared CSP and MixedContentBlocker redirect handling. It seems for CSP, we explicitly Cancel() the old channel [1], while for MixedContent we don't do that [2]. Looking at the comments of AsyncOnChannelRedirect() [3] that shouldn't be a problem though, but also wanted to make sure. Nevertheless, the fetch should go through [2] and returning an error from within that function should prevent the channel from loading any data.
@Honza: Is the above a potential issue?
@ Kate (Tanvi is not accepting ni? requests): I thought we have tests for mixed content redirect handling, but I couldn't fine any in dom/security/test/mixedcontentblocker/. There are only wpt tests for redirect handling. If we don't have mixed content redirect tests, could you please file a bug for that? We definitely need those.

I believe nsCORSListenerProxy also does an explicit cancel:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsCORSListenerProxy.cpp#741>
I think the explicit cancel is probably what we want here as well.
Christoph, do you mind taking this bug however we decide we want it to go? I think it would be best to fix in the common code instead of in fetch, xhr, other consumers, etc.

So, necko's nsHttpChannel explicitly provides the redirect 30X response to the consumer (mListener) when the redirect is vetoed. This is by design and won't change.
What you want is to explicitly cancel the source channel to not get 30X but a gecko loading error code in OnStartRequest/OnStopRequest instead. What nsCORSListenerProxy does is correct.
What's suggested in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - when a redirect is blocked for mixed content blocking the original redirect response is returned instead") - to call Cancel(NS\_BINDING\_ABORTED) or similar error on the source channel - seems correct to me.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

It does seem problematic that each caller needs to account for this. Ideally that gets abstracted somehow so we don't get this leak if we ever introduce another way to load code.

The source channel cancellation MUST be handled above necko. We want to provide the content of the 30X response by default.

I think there is some confusion. There are kind of 3 layers here:
1. nsIChannel implementations
2. Security proxies and listeners that enforce CORS, mixed content, CSP, etc.
3. End client code like fetch(), xhr, document loading, etc.
Right now its up to layer (3) to cancel on the blocked redirect for mixed content. For things like CORS and CSP we cancel at layer (2). We just need to cancel at layer (2) for mixed content as well.
I think Honza is saying we can't do the cancellation at layer (1).

Yes, exactly, thanks for clarifying this.

In the tree, the only mixed-content blocker blocker tests that include tests for redirection are in browser/base/content/test/siteIdentity/browser\_mcb\_redirect.js, and they don't cover this case.

No particular reason. Mostly because we use NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_BAD\_URI when blocking redirects within nsCORSListenerProxy and nsCSPService.

bug\_1402363\_mcb\_redirect.patch
Approval Request Comment
Currently we don't block mixed content redirects. If an HTTPS page hits a 302 to HTTP, then mixed content blocker should block the load which we didn't do correctly.
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
[Bug 418354](/show_bug.cgi?id=418354 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mixed content detection does not take redirection into account") - Mixed content detection does not take redirection into account
[User impact if declined]:
End users might get a false impression, because the pages state seems to be secure but the underlying redirect from HTTPS to HTTP exposes the user to tampering and eavesdropping attacks.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
not yet.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Not really, but there is also the testpage from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - when a redirect is blocked for mixed content blocking the original redirect response is returned instead").
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
XXX
[Is the change risky?]:
Nope, not risky, we are just correctly cancelling the old channel on the network layer if redirect is blocked.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
see previous
[String changes made/needed]:
no

Dan, what do you think? I would rather like to see that fixed in ESR52 as well, allowing mixed content redirects might be troublesome even though we only categorized this bug as sec-moderate.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb) → needinfo?(dveditz)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170413192749
Steps to reproduce:
The Content-Security-Policy can be bypassed using a data: URL opened in a new tab.
Content-Security-Policy doesn't allow javascript execution code on the webpage which uses this security, but in Firefox, if a data: URL is loaded in a new tab, the javascript code contained into this data URL is executed and it can steal the cookie of the website (and others malicious actions).
example:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-eval'">
<a href=" data:text/html;html,<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>">Open Me in a new tab</a>
Actual results:
The Content-Security-Policy can be bypassed if a data URL is opened into a new tab.
Expected results:
In Mozilla Firefox, if a Webpage uses the Content-Security-Policy security, javascript code shouldn't be executed with a data: URL opened in a new tab.

Jordi, thanks for filing the bug. In Firefox, data: URIs inherit the security context of the enclosing document, which is different than in all other browser. Over the years we have accumulated multiple bug reports that data URIs can be used for XSS (see [Bug 255107](/show_bug.cgi?id=255107 "RESOLVED FIXED - Prevent data: URLs from being used for XSS")). The only reason we haven't changed that until now was, that Firefox was the only browser that implemented the data: URI behavior according to the spec. Recently the spec changed, so that data: URIs should not inherit the security context of the enclosing doucment, hence we are about to change that behavior within [Bug 1324406](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324406 "RESOLVED FIXED - Treat 'data:' documents as unique, opaque origins").
If you try your testcase (using a simple alert instead of document.cookie) you will see that all other browsers will prompt the alert, right? Within Firefox, if you simply click the link in your testcase, then Firefox will block the load with the error:
> Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at self (“script-src 'unsafe-eval'”). Source: alert('foo');.
If you right click, open-link-in-new-tab the data: URI link, then I think the problem is that we don't serialize the CSP together with the principal between child and parent, loose the CSP and hence prompt the alert.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Christoph: if we didn't inherit the origin then fine, we also don't inherit the CSP. But if we're inheriting the origin, and the CSP is embedded in the principal (maybe it isn't anymore?) then why doesn't the new document get the CSP? I thought that was one of the points of putting the CSP in the principal. What other "inherit" cases are also broken?
When does this break? The user ctrl-clicks? what if there's a target=\_blank to trigger the new page? That would be a more worrying scenario since it's only normal user interaction.Group: firefox-core-security → dom-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → DOM: SecurityFlags: sec-bounty?Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)Product: Firefox → Core

The CSP is still attached to the principal, but as explained within [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content-Security-Policy Bypass with data: URL opened in a new tab"), when performing e.g. a right-click->open-link-in-new-tab, we do a bunch of front end checks. Amongst others we check whether the page should load in the child or the parent. Currently we don't serialize the CSP between child and parent when serializing a principal and hence we loose it. I think this is what's happening, but obviously needs more investigation.
> When does this break?
I did a bunch of quick checks:
\*) regular click - CSP blocks
\*) ctrl-click - alert prompted
\*) right-click->open-link-in-new-tab - alert prompted
\*) right-click->open-link-in-new-window - alert prompted
\*) <a href="data..." target="\_blank" ...> - CSP blocks

After some debugging I finally located the exact problem [1]. As already suspected we serialize the principal but we don't serialize the CSP within the principal. I remember we already had a discussion around that a while ago and I don't think there is an easy solution to that problem. Gijs, any ideas?

I either wasn't involved in the discussion or just flat out don't remember it (sorry!). Why can't we serialize the principal? Also, that's browser-child.js - does this mean the problem doesn't reproduce with e10s disabled?Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(ckerschb)

If the \_blank case works, even for new windows (turn off "open new windows in a new tab instead") we should be able to make the ctrl-click and context menu cases work without too much craziness.

We can serialize the principal itself - I think the problem is that we don't serialize the CSP within the principal. In other words we loose any CSP attached to the principal during serialization/deserialization. But I just tried with e10s prefed off, and I get the same result, so the problem must be somewhere else.
But somewhere along the road we must loose the CSP, and as far as I remember that could only happen when we serialize/deserialize. The other thing that came to my mind was that we don't pass the right principal (the one with the CSP) to the docshell load, so that then within docshell we create a CSP from the referrer. But that's also not the case - within LoadURI() we already get a valid (actually the correct) triggeringPrincipal (just without the CSP attached).
Mhm, I guess this needs more debugging to find out where we actually loose the CSP - beats me.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Gijs, one problem I already identified (even though it's not the root cause of the problem here) is the fact that we are potentially generating a new codebasePrincipal using the right OA [1], but not resetting any CSP on the old principal. Looking at the stacktrace underneath, do you think we are using the wrong principal within openLinkInTab to begin with? Because this principal is the one that is passed all the way to be set on the loadinfo.

I'm not sure I understand. We should be setting the same CSP on the \*new\* principal as on the \*old\* principal, AIUI. We can't reuse the principal because that breaks opening inheriting-principal-links in containers. That we're not copying the csp is definitely a bug here, though I don't see any way to actually do this. Like, nsIPrincipal just doesn't have any scriptable APIs that allow us to set the CSP. :-\

Sorry, for not being precise. What I meant is that we have to set the same CSP on the new principal that was present on the old principal. Have a look at the attached patch and you know what I mean :-) One of the problems though is that csp is not scriptable. So, I think what we could do is expose a function on nsIPrincipal 'generateNewPrincipalFromOldWithNewArgs()' or something that allows us to pass in the OA we want and just return a new principal (including the CSP). Basically move useOAForPrincipal on nsIPrincipal and implement it in c++. That would work right?
The attached patch fixes the problem for all \*non\* e10s cases for the tests on [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content-Security-Policy Bypass with data: URL opened in a new tab").

The serialization of the CSP is a real problem. When first parsing the CSP we generate an object representation of the CSP (see nsCSPUtils.h). Serializing that object representation seems hard and reparsing the CSP string also seems like a non optimal solution. I have written a bunch of serialization code for principals, but serializing the CSP definitely seems like the hardest. Any suggestions on how to fix that problem?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb) → needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

What makes the problem worse is, that CSP is an active standard which is extended on a regular basis. In terms of maintenance, we would always have to update the serialization code in addition to any actual CSP changes. Keeping that in sync seems error prone on top of the actual serialization work.

How is the cspJSON code implemented? That seems like it'd be sufficient, generally speaking...

Yes, that should work, though the implementation will still return undefined results (probably just the principal you pass in) for null principals or system principals. :-)Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(ckerschb)

That could work actually, we would just need to implement the inverse part for cspToJSON - so the part that generates a CSP from the json. I'll give that a try, but it might take some time since there are also other things I am working on at the moment.Assignee: nobody → ckerschbStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(ckerschb)Priority: -- → P2Whiteboard: [domsecurity-active]

Within this patch I am only fixing the \*non\* e10s parts. If you prefer, we could file a new bug and land this patch there so that this bug only contains the e10s changes. What do you think?
Anyway, I verified this changeset fixes all the testcases described within [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content-Security-Policy Bypass with data: URL opened in a new tab") and further that the automated test browser\_oa\_private\_browsing\_window.js still works, which is the test we introduced with the initial useOAForPrincipal() function implemenetation (See [Bug 1348801](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348801 "VERIFIED FIXED - ”Open Link In New Private Window” prevents the add-on installation")).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The utilityOverlay.js changes look OK to me, but someone else should review the nsScriptSecurityManager changes.
For e10s, I don't mind much about whether we use this bug or another one, but we'll need to ship everything at the same time, I expect... (or be very circumspect about why we're making the changes in the other bug and not link it to this one) to be fair, this is a sec-moderate with significant user interaction, so I guess this might be OK.
Finally, I am still confused about how the e10s case works with target=\_blank. The thing that's creating the about:blank content viewer there must be doing so with a principal with CSP. But I'm pretty sure that the "new window" case for target=\_blank passes through the parent process (because we have to create a new browser window first), so I don't understand how we can be using an un-serialized/deserialized principal which has CSP.
In theory it should be possible to pass the principal around on the content process side only, but I don't know if that's feasible in practice - it would certainly require that we reuse the same content process for the "open link in new tab" case where we have items that inherit principals.

In the end it doesn't really matter I guess. So let's just wait till we have all the code ready within this patch and then get it landed alltogether.

The target="\_blank" uses a different codepatch then 'right-click->open-link-in-new-tab' and hence ends up with a CSP on the principal within docshell. When regular clicking a link we use the principal from nsContentUtils.cpp:5300 (see stacktrace underneath) which is then passed all the way to docshell which then blocks the load here:

If we do this I think we need to be careful that we don't end up propagating the CSP on the principal to places that shouldn't have the propagation. Code may be relying on the serialization to filter it out without realizing it. For example, I had a lot of trouble with this in worker code recently.
I would really love if we could move CSP off the principal as discussed in [bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client"). Probably can't do it here, of course. FWIW, though, I'm making something that can function as the "document settings object" over in [bug 1293277](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293277 "RESOLVED FIXED - service worker Client interface and APIs won't work with multiple content processes") so it might be more possible after that lands.

What cases are those? I am not entirely sure but I would think that whenever we inherit the principal we should also inherit the CSP as well, no?

Gijs, I am making on step at a time here. First I would like to generate the automated test to make sure we never regress that again. When applying the first patch from this bug, in other words when calling clonePrincipalWithUpdatedOA() and when running this test using: ./mach mochitest --disable-e10s .../browser\_data\_load\_inherit\_csp.js then it works.
When running with e10s disabled, then only the first test (the regular click) succeeds, but the other two (where we don't serialize the CSP on the principal) fail.
Ultimately I would like to remove the code duplication for checking the CSP on each subtest. I am pretty sure you can tell me how to do that, right?

How is "inherit the principal" defined in code? We pass nsIPrincipal\* around all over the place, but that does not equate to inheriting the principal. As an example, service workers are constrained to an origin, but the service worker itself should not inherit CSP from the document that registered the service worker. Magical passing of CSP around in our origin identity type makes this really error prone. Dedicated workers had the same problem for a long time as well.
Anyway, we can debate this over in [bug 1293277](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293277 "RESOLVED FIXED - service worker Client interface and APIs won't work with multiple content processes"). Please just don't break any of the worker stuff I just spent a bunch of time fixing.

This is still using a CPOW. You'll want to use a ContentTask for this, here and in the other tests (which you may or may not want to abstract into another helper function):
yield ContentTask.spawn(browser, DATA\_URI, function(uri) {
let link = content.document.getElementById("testlink");

bug\_1358009\_cloneprincipal\_with\_updated\_oa.patch
Boris, I chatted with bholley and he thinks you are the better reviewer for this stuff. Within [Bug 1348801](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348801 "VERIFIED FIXED - ”Open Link In New Private Window” prevents the add-on installation") we had to teach the principal about OriginAttributes, but we didn't propagate the CSP from the old principal on to the newly created one. The fact that we don't expose the CSP to JS caused me to expose that functionality on the scriptSecurityManager. Gijs already took a first look ([comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content-Security-Policy Bypass with data: URL opened in a new tab")). I verified that browser\_oa\_private\_browsing\_window.js (which we wrote for [Bug 1348801](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348801 "VERIFIED FIXED - ”Open Link In New Private Window” prevents the add-on installation")) still works.
Further I verified that with this patch the newly crafted test for this bug (docshell/test/browser/browser\_data\_load\_inherit\_csp.js) works when e10s is disabled. The reason it doesn't work with e10s yet, is because we serialize the principal when ctrl-clicking but we don't serialize the CSP on the principal.

This is kinda preexisting, but in the case when aPrincipal == aTriggeringPrincipal this will break the object identity of the two. Which is mostly a problem for nullprincipals, since those care about object identity...
It might make sense to check for the aPrincipal == aTriggeringPrincipal case and only do the clone once then.

I don't think that's the right behavior, given that nullprincipals can have OA and CSP. Yes, I know that's what the frontend code you're replacing did. It was wrong.
I think what would make the most sense is that this function returns its argument if the originAttributes already match. If not, we clone; that includes cloning for nullprincipals. That will break the security-check object identity, but that should be ok in cases when the originAttributes don't match, because things with non-matching originAttributes should not be able to reach each other anyway. I'm not sure how that should be reflected in the naming of the function; maybe ensureOriginAttributesForPrincipal?
>+++ b/caps/nsScriptSecurityManager.cpp

That returns a random value. You need to set \*aPrincipal to null.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

For the needinfo, we may want move the CSP somewhere else in any case, because it's not inherited in quite the same set of cases as origin inheritance. For example, consider this testcase:
<iframe srcdoc="stuff" sandbox"></iframe>
Per spec, this inherits the CSP from the parent but does NOT inherit the principal. I'm fairly sure we get this wrong right now.
Similarly, per current spec a javascript: navigation inherits the principal but NOT the CSP. I filed <https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2589> but it's not clear how that will get resolved. Same for about:blank; filed <<https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2592>>. And blobs; filed <https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2593>
And what bkelly said about workers: they can inherit origins, but not CSP....

This particular issue was changed in [bug 1073952](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073952 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP can be bypassed with <iframe [sandbox] and [srcdoc]>"), about a month ago.
The key change is that we create a NullPrincipal for sandboxed-loads but set the CSP if we are in a srcdoc.
That being said, it doesn't mean we get CSP inheritance right in the other cases you mentioned and I agree that it should not live on the principal.
(This would also help setting a CSP on privileged chrome pages, that share the same principal.)

Boris, thanks for the notes. In fact, I agree to everything you said now that I think about it. The good news is that your comments are more or less easy to address once we figure a path forward with this bug. In fact, I think we can take that patch and fix that particular problem outside of this bug because those changes are orthogonal to the Principal/CSP inheritance problem we try to solve here.

Yes, I agree. There are quite so many cases where we should inherit the principal but not the CSP and the other way round. One of those edge cases we addressed within [Bug 1073952](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073952 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP can be bypassed with <iframe [sandbox] and [srcdoc]>"), but I am sure there are more of those. The big question is, where should the CSP live? On the nsILoadInfo? But even if we move the CSP somewhere else I guess we still might have to serialize the CSP for some cases, but we could figure those cases along the way. The big question for now, where could the CSP live if not on the principal?

"invalid" means "invalid"--it's not a problem. If we actually \_fixed\_ this then that's a terrible resolution. "worksforme" is normally fine, but since this is a security bug it's usually worth figuring out what fixed it so we know it's not accidental or a side-effect that might go away in the future.
If we know exactly what fixed it then "fixed" is the right resolution (depends on the bug that fixed it). Especially true if there's a bounty nomination on the bug.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDResolution: INVALID → ---

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

* [Bug 1412252](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412252)

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

##### References

* [Bug 1408990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990)

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

* [Bug 1392026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026)

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1370497](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497)

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

##### References

* [Bug 1402363](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363)

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1401339](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339)

#### [#CVE-2017-7837: SVG loaded as <img> can use meta tags to set cookies](#CVE-2017-7837)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

SVG loaded through `<img>` tags can use `<meta>` tags within the SVG data to set cookies for that page.

##### References

* [Bug 1325923](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923)

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

##### References

* [Bug 1399540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540)

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

##### References

* [Bug 1402896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896)

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

##### References

* [Bug 1366420](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366420)

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.

##### References

* [Bug 1397064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064)

#### [#CVE-2017-7827: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 57](#CVE-2017-7827)

Reporter

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
