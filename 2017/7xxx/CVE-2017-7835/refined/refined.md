Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in how Mozilla Firefox handles redirects when mixed content blocking is triggered. When a secure (HTTPS) page attempts to load a subresource that redirects from HTTPS to HTTP, the mixed content blocker fails to cancel the original channel. Instead, it allows the original redirect response to be returned, effectively bypassing the mixed content protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of Redirects:** The primary weakness is the failure to cancel the original channel when a redirect to insecure content is blocked by the mixed content blocker.
- **Inconsistent Security Enforcement:** Unlike CORS and CSP which properly cancel the channel at the security proxy layer, mixed content blocking didn't, leading to inconsistent security enforcement.
- **Exposing Private Information:** Redirect responses can sometimes contain private information that should not be exposed to scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Mixed Content Blocking:** Successful exploitation allows loading of insecure content (like scripts) on a secure page, which could lead to various attacks.
- **Potential Data Exposure:** Private information contained within the redirect response could be exposed to scripts on the page.
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** By allowing the insecure resource to load it exposes the user to the possibility of MitM attacks and other tampering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTPS to HTTP Redirect:** The primary attack vector involves a redirect from an HTTPS resource to an HTTP resource.
- **Fetch API:** The vulnerability was initially discovered in the context of the `fetch()` API. It was later determined that XHR and other consumers of `necko` could be affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to control the redirection target:** The attacker needs to be able to cause a redirect from an HTTPS resource to an HTTP resource.
- **XSS on target site (for private info exposure)**: If the attacker wants to steal private information through the redirect response, they need to have compromised the target site already.

**Technical Details:**

- The issue was that the `nsMixedContentBlocker` was not calling `Cancel()` on the original channel when a mixed content redirect was detected. Other security features like CSP and CORS do perform this action.
- `nsHttpChannel` provides the redirect 30x response to the listener by design, so the channel cancellation has to be implemented above this layer.
- The fix involved adding an explicit `Cancel()` call in `nsMixedContentBlocker.cpp` when a mixed content redirect is blocked.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug report mentions that the issue also affects XHR, indicating the vulnerability is not limited to the Fetch API.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in Firefox 57.
- The bug was classified as sec-moderate.
- The bug report mentions a test case at <https://firefox-redirect-bug.glitch.me/> which could be used to reproduce the issue.
- The bug was fixed by explicitly canceling the channel on the network layer when the redirect was blocked.
- The bug report notes that this bug may have been the reason for disabling some mixed content tests when landing a previous fix.
