  "CVE-2017-7495": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CVELink": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-7495",
      "Description": "A flaw was found in the kernels implementation of ext4 for filesystems mounted with data=ordered mode. Stale data from recently allocated blocks may appear in newly created blocks in files when a system is 'power reset'.  This may allow an attacker to gain information about file contents being written to disk when the system was being reset."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The ext4 filesystem, when mounted with `data=ordered` mode, does not properly handle delayed allocation and flushing of inodes before commit during power failures. Specifically, when delayed allocation is used, the inode is not added to the transaction's list of inodes needing flushing before a commit. This allows the transaction allocating blocks and attaching them to the inode to reach stable storage before the actual block contents.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of delayed allocation in ext4 during power failures.",
        "Lack of guarantee that I/O scheduler or device will not reorder operations, leading to metadata being persisted before data."
      ],
      "Impact": "Information leak of stale data from recently allocated blocks in new files after a system reset.",
       "Attack Vectors": "A power failure or hardware reset while writing to an ext4 file system.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs to induce a power failure (or hardware reset) while data is being written to disk using the ext4 filesystem in `data=ordered` mode."
    },
    "Affected Configurations": [
      "ext4 filesystem mounted with `data=ordered` mode",
      "Linux kernel versions prior to the fix"
    ],
     "References": [
        "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1450261",
        "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=06bd3c36a733ac27962fea7d6f47168841376824",
        "http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q2/259"
      ],
      "Additional Information": "The amount of stale data leaked is limited to the amount of outstanding delayed journal transactions since the last commit, which is 5 seconds by default. Direct I/O writes are not affected."
