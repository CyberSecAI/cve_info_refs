Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7239:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ninka` license identification tool's insufficient escaping of special characters within filenames it processes. Specifically, characters like '&' are not properly handled when passed to shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of external input, specifically filenames, before using them in shell commands.
- **Command Injection:** The lack of escaping allows an attacker to inject shell commands through manipulated filenames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by crafting filenames that execute commands to disclose the data.
- **Manipulation of License Compliance Scan Results:** By injecting commands, an attacker could alter the output of the license compliance scan, leading to unreliable compliance information.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause the application to hang or become unresponsive through carefully crafted filenames that trigger problematic shell commands.
- **Adverse effect on the ninka user's environment:** An attacker might cause an automated continuous integration setup to hang.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Filename Manipulation:** The attack vector is through specially crafted filenames that contain shell metacharacters like '&'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to create or manipulate filenames that the `ninka` tool will process. This could be through a third-party code base, or in some other way injecting the crafted filenames into the scan.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for exploitation.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions up to and including 1.3.0 of ninka.
- The fix is available in version 1.3.2 and later.
- The fix involved replacing the call to `system` with a single argument with a list of arguments to avoid shell interpretation and replacing `open3` with `capture_exec` from `IO::CaptureOutput` module to simplify the code.
- A temporary workaround is to check the filenames passed to the tool using a regex, matching only alphanumerics and some glyphs like dash and dot.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.3 with vector string CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The GitHub Advisory Database provides a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) score is 0.525%
