Fast, powerful, simple

## Home

Hash Suite is a Windows program to test security of password hashes. Main objectives are:

* **Fast:** We offer a program with [very high performance](performance).
* **Simple and modern:** We use a simple GUI with features offered by modern Windows (fig 1).
* **Smart:** Reports with statistics, easy download of quality wordlists, easily fix weak passwords.
* **Powerful:** All common [features](comparison) of modern crackers and many unique to Hash Suite.
* **Scalable:** Works fast even with a huge number of hashes.

[![Hash Suite running on Windows 10 64 bits](hash_suite_win10_crop_v37.png "Hash Suite running on Windows 10 64 bits")](hash_suite_win10_v37.png)

**Fig 1: Hash Suite running on Windows 10 64 bits. Click for full screenshot.**

Hash Suite is primarily intended for system administrators, IT security personnel, and IT security consultants.

Hash Suite supports 13 hash types: LM, NTLM, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, DCC, DCC2, SSHA, md5crypt, bcrypt, sha256crypt, sha512crypt. It imports hashes of these types from text files with each line containing a bare hash or a username:hash pair or being in [PWDUMP tools'](https://www.openwall.com/passwords/pwdump) output format (for LM and NTLM).

Hash Suite also supports WiFi WPA PSK (pre-shared key) with import from pcap or hccapx network traffic capture file formats.
#### Commercial version is available!

You can now use Hash Suite to its full potential. [Place an order here](purchase).

Message-Id: CVE-2017-7239-8662@webweaving.org
Date: Mon, 3 Apr 2017 12:22:15 +0200 (CEST)
From: Dirk-Willem van Gulik <dirkx@...weaving.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2017-7239: ninka license identification tool:  insufficient escaping of external input [vs]

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

             ninka license identification tool
          insufficient escaping of external input

                CVE-2017-7239 / CVSS 9.3
                        1.07

The ninka license identification tool does not properly escape
special characters in the files it encounters - such as the ‘&’.

In case of an alien code bases; or a code base that is brought in for
examination - a third party may doctor the file names as to cause
a certain result of the license compliance scan. Or the attacker may
adversely affect the ninka user their environment (e.g. an automated
continuous integration setup) by causing it to hang.

This can then lead to unauthorised disclosure of information,
unreliable compliance information or a denial of services.

Versions affected:
- - ------------------
All versions up to and including version 1.3.0.

Resolution:
- - -----------
Upgrade to version 1.3.2 or later - available on
<https://github.com/dmgerman/ninka>.

Mitigations and work arounds:
- - -----------------------------
Test the filenames passed for obvious issues. Given that ninka is
generally only applied to (source)code - a regex matching just
the alphanumerics and a few glyphs such as the dash and dot
can usually be applied.

Credits and timeline
- - --------------------
The flaw was found and reported by Dirk-Willem van Gulik <dirkx
@ webweaving.org) on the 12 of March 2017. D.M. German <dmg
@ turingmachine.org >  fixed the issue on the 27th of March 2017.

2017-01-28	vulnerability found, reported to authors.
2017-03-21	sample found in alien codebase.
2017-03-23	reported to more recent email addresses of authors .
2017-03-26	reported to the authors by phone.
2017-03-27	CVE issued by mitre. fix created by author and
                pushed to github (1.3.1)
2017-04-01	Full disclosure process started.
2017-04-03	Updated the advisory; an improverd fix is
                present in version 1.3.2.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
