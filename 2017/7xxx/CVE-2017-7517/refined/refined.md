{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A 1:1 mapping of tenants in Hawkular Metrics and projects/namespaces in OpenShift. When a project is deleted and then recreated with the same name by another user, the second user can access the metrics from the original project.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input validation leading to unauthorized access of metrics data."
    ],
    "impact": "A user can access metrics data from a previous project instance with the same name, potentially revealing sensitive information. ",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user creates a project, uses it, deletes it, and another user recreates it with the same name. The second user then gains access to the first user's project metrics.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create projects within OpenShift and knowledge of previously used project names.",
     "additional_details":"The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Hawkular Metrics maps tenants and how OpenShift manages projects/namespaces, where project names are reused without proper separation of metrics."
