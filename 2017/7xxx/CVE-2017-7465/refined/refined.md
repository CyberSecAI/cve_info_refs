Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure defaults in the JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) implementation used in Red Hat JBoss EAP 7.0 for XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure XSLT Processing:** The JAXP implementation in JBoss EAP 7.0 did not enforce secure processing defaults for XSLT transformations, which can lead to code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who can provide malicious XSLT content for parsing can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSLT Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious XSLT content that the server processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide XSLT Content:** The attacker needs the ability to supply specially crafted XSLT content to the vulnerable application for processing. This could be achieved through various means, depending on how the application handles XSLT transformations.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by setting the `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` feature to true when creating a `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory` instance.
*   The issue was addressed in EAP-CD 14 Tech Preview via RHSA-2020:2563.
