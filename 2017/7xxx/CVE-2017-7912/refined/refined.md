- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control. A specially crafted HTTP request and response could allow an attacker to gain access to the device management page with admin privileges without proper authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated access to the web management portal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote access to the web management portal with admin privileges without authentication. Full control over the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request and response to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the device. No authentication required. Low skill level to exploit.
