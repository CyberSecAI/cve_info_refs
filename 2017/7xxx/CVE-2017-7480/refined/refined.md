Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7480:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `rkhunter` application downloads various files, including `mirrors.dat`, via insecure HTTP connections.
*   These downloaded files are then parsed as shell commands by `bash`.
*   No signature or strong verification is performed, only a version check that can be easily faked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Download:** Downloading files over HTTP without any integrity checks or signatures is a significant weakness, making the application susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
*   **Command Injection:** Parsing the downloaded files as shell commands allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the execution flow of `rkhunter`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the same privileges as the `rkhunter` process, which is often root.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could inject commands that cause the system to freeze or become unresponsive.
*   **Other Unspecified Impacts**: The attacker can perform any other malicious action allowed by the privileges under which rkhunter is running.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker positioned between the user's system and the server hosting the `rkhunter` update files can intercept the HTTP requests.
*   The attacker can inject malicious code into the downloaded files that the vulnerable system will then interpret as commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the `rkhunter` instance and the update server.
*   **MitM Capabilities:** They need the ability to modify the HTTP response, which involves network tampering capabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because `rkhunter` downloads files insecurely via HTTP and parses them with bash.
*   The `mirrors.dat` file is one of the files downloaded in this manner.
*   A patch was created to remove the insecure download options.
*   The issue was fixed in `rkhunter` version 1.4.6 and a Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201805-11) was issued to address the issue
*   The upstream fix involved tightening the input verification check, but the insecure download method remained, prompting the downstream patch.
