An attacker can inject a file with MITM which is then run  in bash. This could lead to remote code execution.

While this is true, as the workaround from the GLSA states, users should not trust HTTP based sources, but they may want to migrate to more secure sources and because of that fix the real problem which is beyond the tool.   thanks, ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Michael Palimaka (kensington)   gentoo-dev  2018-06-21 11:41:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to James Le Cuirot from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=623150#c16)) > I should have said so sooner but I don't think this was fixed in the right > way.

At the time I checked, https was not available and upstream wasn't actually making any changes in that updates file. ``` |  |

# Rootkit Hunter: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201805-11**

A vulnerability has been found in Rootkit Hunter that allows a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-forensics/rkhunter** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.6** |

### Background

Scans for known and unknown rootkits, backdoors, and sniffers.

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered in Rootkit Hunter that allows the
downloading of mirror updates over insecure channels (HTTP).
Furthermore, the mirror update is then executed in Bash.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by performing a man-in-the-middle attack, could
execute arbitrary code, conduct a Denial of Service, or have other
unspecified impacts.

### Workaround

Users are advised to not trust insecure protocols such as HTTP and to
turn off any mirror updates utilizing such channels.

### Resolution

All Rootkit Hunter users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-forensics/rkhunter-1.4.6"

```

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# rkhunter: [CVE-2017-7480] Potential RCE after MiTM due to clear text download without signature

---

*From*: Michael Scherer <misc () zarb org>

Hi,

while evaluating various security solutions, I looked at
rkhunter, and found that it do download by default various
files over http and parse them with bash:

For example, it download mirrors.dat over http, using no signature and
just a version verification that can be faked:

# cat /var/lib/rkhunter/db/mirrors.dat
Version:2007060601
mirror=<http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net>
mirror=<http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net>

So I will assume that a attacker can inject a file with MITM without
much problem.

And it turn out that since rkhunter is in bash, it parse the file as
bash.

So adding something like:

mirror=$(sleep 455)

in the file result into "rkhunter --update" doing this:

\_ /bin/sh /usr/bin/rkhunter --update
\_ /bin/sh /usr/bin/rkhunter --update
\_ sleep 455

It also :nd on a few packages (if not all), rkhunter --update is run by cron,
as root, so without much limitation.

Upstream have been warned 2 months ago, and I also did warned
RH product security, who assigned CVE-2017-7480  to it.

Unfortunaly, half of the upstream developpers seems to have disappeared and the
software is in maintenance mode, so no fix is avaliable yet, except "turn off
mirror update". Upstream told me to publish it, but I didn't found time earlier.
