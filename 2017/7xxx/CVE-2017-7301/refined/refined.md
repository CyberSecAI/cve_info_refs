Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an off-by-one error in the linker's (ld) code when checking for potential string buffer overflows while loading symbols from a corrupt input file. Specifically, the issue arises within the `aout_link_add_symbols` function, related to handling symbol table entries in a.out object files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. This means that the overflow occurs in memory allocated dynamically on the heap.
- **Off-by-One Error:** The core issue is an incorrect boundary check when processing string offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overflow leads to memory corruption in the heap.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the bug report, heap overflows can sometimes be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution, especially if an attacker can control the overflow's contents and overwrite function pointers or other critical data. However, the report doesn't indicate that this was explicitly demonstrated, only that the overflow is present.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While the report mentions that the overflow does *not* actually crash the linker, it still creates a memory corruption. It could potentially lead to a crash under certain circumstances or cause the linker to behave unpredictably, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted or corrupt input file that the linker processes. This input file contains malicious symbol information designed to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input to the Linker:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted input file to the linker. This implies the attacker needs to be able to control input to the program.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Format:** The attacker needs knowledge of the a.out file format to craft an input that triggers the off-by-one error during symbol loading.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to a previous bug ([PR20909](show_bug.cgi?id=20909)), which was also caused by a similar issue in the same code area.
- Address Sanitizer (ASAN) detected the heap buffer overflow.
- Valgrind detected conditional jumps based on uninitialized values in the same code area.
- The vulnerability was addressed by fixing the off-by-one error in the `aout_link_add_symbols` function.
- The patch was committed to the master branch.
