- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple memory corruption issues in ld64.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Memory corruption vulnerabilities due to improper memory handling when parsing a Mach-O file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Parsing a maliciously crafted Mach-O file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious Mach-O file to the vulnerable ld64 component.
