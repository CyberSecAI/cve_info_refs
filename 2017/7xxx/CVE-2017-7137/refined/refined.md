- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple memory corruption issues in `ld64` (the linker)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to improper memory handling when parsing a maliciously crafted Mach-O file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted Mach-O files that are processed by `ld64`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted Mach-O file that is processed by the vulnerable `ld64` component.
