- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the `episodeID` HTTP parameter within the `unaired.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `$_GET['episodeID']` parameter is directly used in the HTML output without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page. If a user clicks on a crafted URL containing the malicious script, the code will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `episodeID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript and lure a victim to click the link. No special access to the web server or application is needed.
