Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-7870:

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause is an out-of-bounds write flaw within the `tools::Polygon::Insert` function in LibreOffice when rendering certain documents containing polygon images. Specifically, the issue occurs during polygon processing (splitting) in Windows Metafiles (WMF), leading to an attempt to create polygons with more points than the internal class could handle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. If the polygon splitting produces a polygon with excessive points, a buffer overflow occurs due to the size exceeding the allocated memory.
*   **Insufficient bounds checking:**  The lack of proper bounds checking allows the overflow to occur.
*   **Use of untrusted input:** The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted WMF documents, highlighting the weakness in handling external, potentially malicious, input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the malicious LibreOffice file.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The vulnerability could also cause a crash, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious document:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted LibreOffice file containing a malicious WMF image that triggers the polygon processing flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote unauthenticated attacker:**  A remote attacker can exploit this by sending the malicious document to a victim.
*   **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file with LibreOffice.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to processing polygon images within Windows Metafiles (WMF).
*   The issue was present in LibreOffice versions prior to 5.2.5 and 5.3.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a check to ensure polygon splitting operations are safe.
*   Red Hat has classified the security impact of this issue as Moderate, while other sources might classify it as high.
*   Upstream commit `62a97e6a561ce65e88d4c537a1b82c336f012722` in LibreOffice's codebase addressed this issue.
*   The vulnerability can potentially be exploited in multiple Red Hat Products (RHEL, etc.).
