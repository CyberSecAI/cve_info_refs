Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to create modal alerts using the `data:` protocol within iframes. This allows a modal alert to be displayed over arbitrary domains after a page navigation, effectively spoofing the origin of the alert as coming from the iframe's content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof the origin of a modal alert, leading users to believe it originates from a trusted domain when it actually comes from a potentially malicious iframe.
*   **Inconsistent Security Context:** The `data:` protocol, when used in combination with iframes and modal alerts, creates a situation where the security context is not consistently enforced. The alert is displayed after a navigation, outside the intended scope of the iframe's origin.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **User confusion/deception:** Users can be tricked into believing the alert is coming from a legitimate site, thus increasing the likelihood that they'll interact with it (potentially revealing sensitive information, or taking actions they wouldn't otherwise).
*   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** The ability to overlay a modal alert on a different domain opens the door for phishing attacks and other social engineering schemes. Attackers can craft alerts that mimic legitimate login prompts or notifications, tricking users into providing information they otherwise wouldn't.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows attackers to inject a modal alert over an arbitrary domain, and potentially trick users into interacting with it, and possibly disclosing information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Iframe injection:** The attack vector involves injecting a malicious iframe into a webpage, which then uses the `data:` protocol to trigger a modal alert.
*   **Data: protocol:** The `data:` protocol is used to load the iframe's content, and is critical for triggering the spoofing.
*   **Page navigation:** The attack occurs by loading a malicious iframe, navigating the top-level page, and then triggering the modal alert on the new top-level page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to inject iframes:** An attacker needs to be able to inject an iframe into a target website. This could be achieved through a cross-site scripting vulnerability or by controlling a resource included on the target page.
*   **Control over iframe content:** The attacker must control the content of the injected iframe, allowing them to use the data: protocol and trigger the modal alert as desired.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content indicates that this vulnerability primarily affects Firefox and Thunderbird, as they share the underlying rendering engine where this vulnerability exists.
*   The content suggests this issue is a cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS), though this is specifically a spoofing issue, not a cross-site scripting attack.
*   Multiple sources suggest that patches have been made available in Firefox 55 and Firefox ESR 52.3 and Thunderbird 52.3
