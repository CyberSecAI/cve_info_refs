Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of clients connecting to an HTTP proxy with NTLMv2 authentication within OpenVPN.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The vulnerability lies in the way OpenVPN processes NTLMv2 authentication when connecting to an HTTP proxy. Specifically, it appears that OpenVPN is not correctly parsing or managing the authentication process which leads to a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a crash of the OpenVPN application by exploiting this flaw.
*   **Potential Information Leak:** There's a possibility that sensitive information such as the user's proxy password could be leaked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need to be on the same local network as the OpenVPN server.
*   **HTTP Proxy:** The attack vector involves a client connecting through an HTTP proxy requiring NTLMv2 authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to initiate a connection to an OpenVPN server that is configured to use an HTTP proxy with NTLMv2 authentication.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the connection process in a way that triggers the vulnerability.
*   No authentication on the VPN itself is mentioned, this is regarding the authentication to the proxy.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-7520 describes a vulnerability in OpenVPN related to how it handles NTLMv2 authentication with HTTP proxies. By sending malformed requests during the NTLMv2 authentication process via the proxy, an attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially expose the user's proxy password.
