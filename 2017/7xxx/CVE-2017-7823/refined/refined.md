CVE-2017-7823: CSP sandbox directive did not create a unique origin
```

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Content Security Policy (CSP) sandbox directive failed to create a unique origin for the document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The CSP `sandbox` directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the `allow-same-origin` keyword was always specified. This allowed scripts within the sandboxed document to bypass the intended same-origin restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content, violating the security policy intended by the website.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a sandboxed document, which would then be executed with the same origin as the embedding document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a page that is being rendered with a CSP `sandbox` directive.
