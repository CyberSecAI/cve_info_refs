Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2017-7656:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The content from bugs.eclipse.org directly references "CVE-2017-7656", linking it to a "Jetty: CVE Request: HTTP/0.9 Request Smuggling" bug.
   - The description from bugs.eclipse.org and the Oracle CPU both mention HTTP/0.9 handling issues and request smuggling.
   - The NetApp advisory also lists CVE-2017-7656 as being an Eclipse Jetty Vulnerability.
   - Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - **Improper Handling of HTTP/0.9:** The core issue is that Jetty servers were not handling HTTP/0.9 requests correctly. Specifically, they were accepting HTTP/1 style request lines (e.g. "GET /resource HTTP/0.9") that declared an HTTP/0.9 version which does not have a version in the request line. They were then treating it like a 0.9 request and sending the response without any headers.
   - **Accepting Headers in HTTP/0.9 Mode:** Jetty's parser was also accepting request headers, like the "Byte-Range" header, in HTTP/0.9 mode, even though the HTTP/0.9 spec doesn't allow request headers. This behavior is also incorrect and contributes to the vulnerability

   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - HTTP Request Smuggling: When combined with specific circumstances (like an intermediary accepting and passing through HTTP/0.9 requests without acting on them), this flaw could be exploited for request smuggling
     -  Parsing headers when there shouldn't be any.
     -  Accepting a version identifier for HTTP/0.9 which does not exist in the spec.

   **Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Request Smuggling:** The vulnerabilities can lead to HTTP request smuggling, particularly when used with a Range header.
   - **Cache Poisoning:** If deployed behind an intermediary that also accepted HTTP/0.9 requests, it could interpret a headerless response sent by Jetty as HTTP/1 headers, leading to cache poisoning.
   - **Unintended Parser Consequences:** The incorrect parsing could cause unintended side effects in the parser.

   **Attack Vectors:**

   -  Malicious client sends a crafted HTTP/0.9 request (using the format of HTTP/1.x) with or without headers
   -   The intermediary or proxy treats the response as having headers.

   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Jetty server.
   - **Intermediary Presence (for Cache Poisoning):**  For cache poisoning, there needs to be an intermediary (e.g., a proxy server) that also incorrectly handles HTTP/0.9 responses.
   - **Ability to send crafted HTTP requests and potentially include request headers.**

**3. Additional Details (Not in the CVE description):**

   - **Specific Versions Affected:** The bugs.eclipse.org content identifies the following affected versions:
     - All EOL releases - 9.2.x and older (all configurations)
     - 9.3.x (all configurations)
     - 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled)
   - **Specific Fixes:** The fixes were included in:
     - 9.3.24.v20180605
     - 9.4.11.v20180605
   - **Reported By**: RÃ©gis Leroy is credited with discovering and reporting this issue.
   - **CWE**: The discussion points toward CWE-444 ("Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests") as a general description of the problem.

**4. Oracle CPU Advisory Context**
  - The Oracle advisory includes the CVE in the context of other vulnerabilities being addressed across their product line
    - For example, the Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service is vulnerable when a data loader is used
   - Many Oracle products that include Jetty are impacted, demonstrating a wide attack surface.

**5. NetApp Advisory Context**
  - NetApp confirms their products use Jetty
    - Lists specific versions that are impacted.
    - Lists fixes to address the vulnerability.

In summary, the content provides good detail on the root cause of the CVE-2017-7656 vulnerability which is related to HTTP/0.9 request handling errors, potential attack vectors, and specific affected versions and fixes. It also notes its impact for request smuggling and cache poisoning. The content also highlights the range of products that are impacted, specifically those from Oracle and NetApp.
