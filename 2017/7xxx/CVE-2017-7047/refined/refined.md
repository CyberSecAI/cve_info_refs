Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7047:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in a logic error within `libxpc`, a library used for inter-process communication. Specifically, when `xpc_data` objects (which contain serialized data) are large, `libxpc` creates mach memory entry ports to represent the memory region. The vulnerability occurs because a malicious sender can manipulate the flags of `mach_make_memory_entry_64` such that the memory entry received by the target process represents a shared memory region.  This allows the sender to modify the contents of the `xpc_data` object while the receiver is processing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Shared memory vulnerability:** The core issue is that the receiver of an `xpc_data` object assumes that the data it receives is static and immutable during processing, and doesn't expect the data can be modified by the sender.
- **Memory corruption:** By controlling the content of a `xpc_data` object (due to the shared memory vulnerability) and using specific methods of `NSXPCDecoder` such as `decodeCStringForKey:`, the attacker can cause a memory corruption. The method signature string is parsed by `[NSMethodSignature signatureWithObjCTypes]`, and by modifying the length of this string in shared memory after the allocation but before parsing, an out-of-bounds write can occur.
- **Race condition:** The exploit is dependent on a race condition, where the attacker modifies the shared memory after the receiver has allocated memory but before it finishes processing. This makes the exploitation less reliable, requiring multiple attempts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:**  The memory corruption vulnerability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target process, since it's memory corruption in a security-sensitive part of the code.
- **Privilege escalation:** By targeting services running with higher privileges, such as the `airportd` daemon, this vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation.
- **Remote debugging:** As shown in the provided exploit information for "triple_fetch", a remote lldb debugserver stub can be created that allows debugging of all userspace processes on iOS, which is usually restricted.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted xpc messages:** The attack vector is through crafting custom XPC messages that contain specially crafted `xpc_data` objects backed by shared memory.
- **Interposition library:** As mentioned in the exploit description, an interposition library can be used to manipulate the `xpc_data` objects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted XPC messages, thus requiring an attacker to be able to send these messages to the vulnerable process. This could be achieved through local access or through an exploited application.
- **Knowledge of xpc and NSXPC:** The attacker needs an in-depth understanding of how XPC and NSXPC work to be able to craft the necessary messages.
- **Ability to create shared memory:** The attacker needs to create shared memory regions and manipulate their flags.
- **Precise timing for race condition:** Due to the race condition, the exploit relies on precise timing, and might require multiple attempts.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided text refers to NSXPC, a higher-level RPC mechanism built on top of XPC. The vulnerability is triggered when NSXPC is used to send serialized NSInvocation objects, which contain the method calls to perform on a remote object.
- The vulnerability affects multiple platforms including macOS, iOS, tvOS and watchOS as all of these use `libxpc` as part of their operating system's core functionality.

In summary, CVE-2017-7047 is a significant vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate XPC messages, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution in processes using the vulnerable library. The exploitation relies on the ability to send crafted XPC messages and is complicated by a race condition. The vulnerability was patched in various Apple OS versions.
