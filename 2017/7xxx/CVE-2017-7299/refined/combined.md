| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=20908#c0)  Marcel Böhme    2016-12-02 07:59:16 UTC  ``` Dear all,  The following bug was found with AFLFast, a fork of AFL, in a 24 hour fuzzing session on Binutils. Thanks also to Van-Thuan Pham.  The linker crashes with an invalid read of size 8 for the following execution on Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64 in Binutils trunk and for preinstalled version v2.26.1 and on Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 for Binutils in trunk. It works fine for Binutils v2.24.  $ printf "\x00\x00\xff\xff\x00\x00L\x010000\x18\x00\x00\x0000\x0400000000000000000000\x00000\x00" > test $ ./ld -qN test /home/ubuntu/subjects/binutils-gdb/ld/ld-new: i386 architecture of input file `test2' is incompatible with i386:x86-64 output /home/ubuntu/subjects/binutils-gdb/ld/ld-new: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000000400078 Segmentation fault  VALGRIND says: ==8561== Invalid read of size 8 ==8561==    at 0x6DE6D0: bfd_elf_final_link (elflink.c:11427) ==8561==    by 0x484B7C: ldwrite (ldwrite.c:577) ==8561==    by 0x408334: main (ldmain.c:444) ==8561==  Address 0x3030303030303068 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd  UBSAN complains: ../../bfd/peicode.h:658:42: runtime error: member access within misaligned address 0x61e00000f8c7 for type 'struct coff_section_tdata', which requires 8 byte alignment 0x61e00000f8c7: note: pointer points here  00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00              ^   Best regards, - Marcel ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=20908#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2016-12-02 17:47:50 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Nick Clifton <nickc@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=d7f399a8de4c55eb841db6493597a587fac002de>  commit d7f399a8de4c55eb841db6493597a587fac002de Author: Nick Clifton <nickc@redhat.com> Date:   Fri Dec 2 17:46:26 2016 +0000      Fix seg-fault in linker when passed a corrupt binary input file.

The problem was that the code to emit relocs was not checking the format of the input file before trying to read the ELF reloc section header...  Patch applied, bug fixed.
