- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The linker (ld) was not checking the format of the input file before attempting to read the ELF reloc section header. Specifically, the code responsible for emitting relocations was trying to access the reloc section header of a file without verifying if it was actually an ELF file. This resulted in an invalid memory access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper input validation, specifically not checking the file format before accessing ELF specific data structures, led to an invalid memory read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, crashing the linker (ld). This could lead to a denial-of-service scenario, where a malicious user could cause the linker to crash, preventing other users from linking their binaries.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to supply a crafted input file to the linker that is not a valid ELF file but the linker attempts to treat it like one. This input file can be provided as a command line argument to the `ld` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to execute the `ld` command with a crafted input file. No special privileges are needed.
