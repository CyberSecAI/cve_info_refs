Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7844:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a regression introduced by the Stylo rendering engine. It involves how Firefox handles SVG images that contain anchor links (`<a>` tags) when rendered in a `<canvas>` element. The browser incorrectly applies `:visited` styles to anchor links within the SVG image, even when the image is being used as an external resource (e.g., via an `<img>` tag).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect application of `:visited` CSS styles on anchor links within external SVG images, when rendered in a canvas.
- Failure to properly isolate the rendering of external SVG images from the browsing history.
- Regression from a previously fixed bug (bug 641731)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **History Leakage:** A malicious website can exploit this vulnerability to determine a user's browsing history.
- **Privacy Violation:** By manipulating the color of anchor links within an SVG image, an attacker can infer which pages the user has previously visited.
- **Fingerprinting:** The technique could be used to create a unique fingerprint of a user based on their visited history.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A website embeds an `<img>` tag that references an external SVG document containing anchor tags with `a:visited` styles.
- The website renders the image to a canvas.
- By analyzing the rendered image pixel data or the size of the saved PNG, the attacker can determine which URLs the user has visited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control a webpage that can load external SVG images.
- The attacker needs to be able to draw the loaded SVG image onto a canvas element.
- The attacker does not need any special access to the user's machine, as the exploit relies on manipulating web technologies.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability only affects Firefox 57 and later versions due to the introduction of Stylo.
- The fix involves disabling the `:visited` style for documents used as an image (`nsIDocument::IsBeingUsedAsImage()`).
- The vulnerability was initially missed by reftests (automated tests) due to the tests not effectively simulating real-world scenarios with history tracking enabled.
