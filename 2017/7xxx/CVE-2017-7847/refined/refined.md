  "cve": "CVE-2017-7847",
  "description": "Crafted CSS in an RSS feed can leak and reveal local path strings, which may contain user name.",
  "extracted_data": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of the @-moz-document CSS at-rule, which allows applying CSS based on the URL string. When the <link> element for the article URL is missing, the feed content is loaded from the local filesystem, using a path like 'mailbox:///C:/Users/[USER_NAME]/...'. This allows an attacker to exploit the @-moz-document rule, and leak the user name from the local path using CSS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames",
       "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a CSS Style Sheet"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could allow a malicious actor to reveal local path strings that may contain user names. An attacker can craft malicious CSS within an RSS feed and inject it into the target's application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted RSS feed containing malicious CSS.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to inject a malicious RSS feed into a vulnerable application, which can be through user subscription to the feed."
