    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-7309",
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MantisBT Configuration Report page (adm_config_report.php) allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code (if CSP settings permit it) through a crafted 'config_option' parameter.",
    "root_cause": "The 'config_option' parameter in the adm_config_report.php page is not properly sanitized before being output, allowing for the injection of arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "entry_points": [
        "The 'config_option' parameter in the URL of the adm_config_report.php page."
       ],
       "exploitation": "By crafting a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload in the 'config_option' parameter, an attacker can trigger the execution of the script when an administrator visits the page.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL, usually by tricking an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious URL."
    },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is related to CVE-2017-6973, stemming from the same root cause of not escaping the parameter before output. The fix involves sanitizing the 'config_option' parameter using `string_attribute()` function before outputting it in the HTML. This was introduced as part of [MantisBT master 13bda674](/bugs/plugin.php?page=Source/view&id=21795) (issue [0020058](/bugs/view.php?id=20058 \"[closed] Updating config items in configuration report adds new ones\"))"
