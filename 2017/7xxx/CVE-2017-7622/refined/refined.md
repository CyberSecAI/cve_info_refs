Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-7622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `dde-daemon` service, a component of the Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE). This service, which runs with root privileges, provides functionality for other DDE applications via D-Bus messages. Specifically, the vulnerability is in how `dde-daemon` handles requests to modify GRUB boot settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication:** The `dde-daemon` does not properly authenticate or authorize the user calling the `DoWriteGrubSettings()` function. This allows any user on the system to modify the `/etc/default/grub` file, which contains GRUB configuration parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can modify the GRUB configuration to execute arbitrary code with root privileges during the boot process. In the provided proof-of-concept exploit, the attacker adds a new sudo user with no password to `/etc/sudoers`, effectively gaining root access.
*   **Backdoor Creation:** By manipulating the GRUB configuration, an attacker could create a backdoor or perform other malicious actions with elevated privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access to the system.
*   **D-Bus Interface:** The attack is performed through the D-Bus interface provided by `dde-daemon`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account on the vulnerable system.
*   The attacker must be able to send D-Bus messages to the `dde-daemon` service.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit script modifies `/etc/default/grub` by setting `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` to include `init=/var/tmp/hack.sh`. This causes the script `/var/tmp/hack.sh` to be executed as the init process during boot.
* The exploit script works on Deepin and Manjaro distributions, which have the `update-grub` pre-installed. It is partially successful on Arch and Fedora, where `/etc/default/grub` is modified but `update-grub` command isn't available by default, thus needing manual update to `grub.cfg`.
*   The exploit works on systems running DDE version 15 or later.
*   The affected distributions mentioned include: Ubuntu (with PPA), Fedora (with COPR), ArchLinux, Deepin, and Manjaro (with DDE).
*  The provided content includes the exploit code that demonstrates the vulnerability
