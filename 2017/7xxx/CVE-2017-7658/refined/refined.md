Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-7658:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Jetty server's tolerant parsing of HTTP request headers allowed for inconsistencies in how different intermediaries handled requests. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from how Jetty handles:
    *   **Multiple Content-Length Headers:** When multiple `Content-Length` headers are present in a request, Jetty incorrectly attempts to determine which one to use.
    *   **Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding Headers:** When both a `Content-Length` and a `Transfer-Encoding` header are present, Jetty ignores the `Content-Length` header, as per RFC 2616, but this could differ from an intermediary's interpretation.
    *    **Pre-Query Whitespace**: The parser allowed too much whitespace before the request query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The core vulnerability is HTTP request smuggling (CWE-444). Due to the inconsistencies in handling headers, a malicious actor could craft requests that are interpreted differently by Jetty and an intermediary. This allows the attacker to "smuggle" requests.
*   **Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is due to inconsistent parsing and handling of HTTP headers related to content length and transfer encoding, leading to disagreement on body length.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Authorization:** If an intermediary is performing authorization checks, a smuggled request might bypass those checks, potentially allowing unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Pipelined Request Injection:** If an intermediary chose the shorter content length and passed a longer body, the extra body content could be interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request which would be processed without authorization.
*   **Data Modification/Disclosure, Privilege Escalation, DoS:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of potentially sensitive information, privilege escalation, unauthorized addition or modification of data or Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack requires a vulnerable Jetty server and an intermediary (e.g., a proxy server or load balancer) that interprets the same HTTP headers differently.
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with multiple `Content-Length` headers, or both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, or malformed whitespace before the request query, exploiting the inconsistent header handling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Jetty server, typically through a vulnerable intermediary.
*   The attacker does not require authentication.
* The intermediary must have different parsing logic or be vulnerable to the same issue.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Jetty versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x, and 9.4.x (specifically in HTTP/1.x configurations).
*   The issue is resolved in versions 9.2.25.v20180606, 9.3.24.v20180605, and 9.4.11.v20180605.
*   The vulnerability is not present in HTTP/2 users.
*   NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of Jetty are also affected, which are detailed in the NetApp advisory.
* The issue is rated critical with a CVSS score of 9.8
