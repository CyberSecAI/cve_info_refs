**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the HipChat server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File Import:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted malicious file to the HipChat server via its file import functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Server Administrator privileges:** The attacker must have server administrator level privileges on the HipChat Server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects HipChat Server versions 1.0 up to but not including 2.2.3.
- The provided resolution includes a patch and suggests immediate upgrade to a fixed version.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" in severity.
