- The description provided by the suse.com CVE pages that references CVE-2017-7607 at MITRE and states, "The handle_gnu_hash function in readelf.c in elfutils 0.168 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted ELF file."

Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2017-7607.

Guideline 4: Extract relevant vulnerability information

- Root cause of vulnerability: A heap-based buffer overflow in the `handle_gnu_hash` function within the `readelf.c` file of elfutils. This is due to an incorrect sanity check when indexing the `chain` array.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer over-read. The vulnerability occurs when `eu-readelf` processes a crafted ELF file and incorrectly calculates the size of the hash chain, resulting in reading outside of allocated memory.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (application crash). The over-read leads to a crash of the `eu-readelf` tool, preventing it from processing further ELF files.
- Attack vectors: A crafted ELF file. The vulnerability is triggered when `eu-readelf` attempts to process a malformed ELF file with an invalid hash section, specifically the GNU hash section.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious ELF file to the `eu-readelf` utility. This could be done through a user being tricked to open the malicious file, or an automated system parsing the malformed file.
