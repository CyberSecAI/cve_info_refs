Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inconsistent application of the Referrer Policy for `<link>` elements during resource loading. Specifically, when a document's Referrer Policy is set to "no-referrer",  two network requests were sometimes generated for `<link>` elements. One of these requests incorrectly included the referrer despite the specified policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Referrer Policy Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to consistently respect the "no-referrer" policy, leading to unintended leakage of referrer information. This exposes potentially sensitive data about the referring page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the unintended disclosure of the referring page's URL. This can be a privacy issue and could expose information about the user's browsing activity to third-party servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** A malicious website could include a `<link>` element referencing a third-party server. If the victim's browser does not respect the "no-referrer" policy, the malicious site would learn the victim's previously visited page.
- **Cross-Origin Requests:** The vulnerability involves a cross-origin request, meaning the malicious website could be on a different domain than the victim's current page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Serve Web Content:**  The attacker needs to be able to host a web page that includes a `<link>` element with a "no-referrer" policy and also to control a server to which the leaked referer is sent.
- **No Prior Access:** The attacker does not require prior access to the user's system or browser and can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit the malicious page.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 57 by addressing the issue of speculative loading which ignored the referrerpolicy attribute.
- Bug 1384493 was mentioned as the fix that resolved the issue.
- This vulnerability is categorized as a "low severity security issue".
- The bug was also reported in Chrome, which indicates a similar vulnerability existed in that browser as well.
