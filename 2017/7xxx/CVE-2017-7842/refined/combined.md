## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 57

Announced
November 14, 2017
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 57

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

##### References

* [Bug 1406750](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406750)
* [Bug 1412252](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412252)

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

##### References

* [Bug 1408990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990)

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

##### References

* [Bug 1392026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026)

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1370497](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497)

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

##### References

* [Bug 1402363](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363)

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1401339](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339)

#### [#CVE-2017-7837: SVG loaded as <img> can use meta tags to set cookies](#CVE-2017-7837)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

SVG loaded through `<img>` tags can use `<meta>` tags within the SVG data to set cookies for that page.

##### References

* [Bug 1325923](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923)

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

##### References

* [Bug 1399540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540)

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

##### References

* [Bug 1402896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896)

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

##### References

* [Bug 1366420](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366420)

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.

* [Bug 1397064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064)

#### [#CVE-2017-7827: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 57](#CVE-2017-7827)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[bookmarks.html](attachment.cgi?id=8869635)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8869635&action=edit)

It is possible to inject Javascript into the HTML export file of the bookmark manager via the Tags field.
To reproduce:
\* Create a bookmark with a tag like " onmouseover="alert(1)" "
\* Export bookmarks to HTML via bookmark manager
\* open bookmarks.html file and move over the bookmark
This is almost certainly not intended and the tags should be properly escaped. I thought a while whether this would have any security implications. I couldn't come up with a realistic scenario where this matters, but one could construct less realistic scenarios (e.g. a publicly available firefox installation where the bookmarks of the users are regularly exported and uploaded to a webpage). So I'd say it's a very low severity security issue, but still should be fixed.

I'm assuming we've long cleaned up titles and other elements that can be set by the page. If it's only tags this is essentially self-xss, but I worry about how we missed escaping on that field. Are any others affected?Flags: needinfo?(mak77)Keywords: [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)Whiteboard: self-xss

hm, cool, I had written a long reply, but then I've lost it due to some recent bugs breaking sessionhistory :(
Btw, let's sum up.
The bug is here:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/a14524a72de6f4ff738a5e784970f0730cea03d8/toolkit/components/places/BookmarkHTMLUtils.jsm#1146>
We have an escapeHTMLEntities util, but we didn't apply it to tags (ooops)
HTML is an obsolete format for bookmarks, we keep it for 2 reasons:
1. default bookmarks are still in this format
2. sharing with third party software (yes, an add-on could probably cover this)
The only ways to generate a Bookmarks.html are:
a. manually set autoExportHTML pref
b. go to the Library window and Export Bookmarks
In general we don't strip html from strings, nor we do much sanitization on input. Most services/components are unlikely to sanitize string contents for each of their APIs. The html export case is special and that's why we have escapeHTMLEntities, the json export does escaping by itself for example.
The only strings we get from Content are title and description, both are read from the document, doesn't looks like we do much sanitization of their content on input.
Maybe we should consider having a centralized sanitization method and make every API pass strings through it?
Are we worried only about html exports, or are there other cases that come to your mind we should pay attention to?Flags: needinfo?(mak77)Priority: -- → P2

Given that there's no visible activity on fixing this and it's been open several months I intend to disclose this bug within a week.

well, it's self xss and sec-low, so it makes sense it didn't get much priority. That said, the fix looks simple enough that it's worth just doing it.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1264165](/show_bug.cgi?id=1264165 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement <link> referrerpolicy attribute") added support for referrer policy attributes. But somehow <link> sends 2 requests, 1 with referrer and 1 without referrer, which bypasses this policy.

Not sure where this is coming from. But this seems to be fixed in 57. I can reproduce it in 55 and 56 but 57 (Nightly) sends only a single request without referrer.
Christoph, unless you think this should be uplifted I'd let it ride the trains. We should keep an eye on it though as I don't know what fixed or caused this issue.Flags: needinfo?(franziskuskiefer) → needinfo?(ckerschb)

I tested this using FF55 as well as a recent pull from mozilla-central.
Using FF55:
I see two requests, one leaking the referrer, one not.
Since the testpage from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Referrer leaked even after setting referrer policy attribute") is using:
<link href="//www.whatismyreferer.com" rel="stylesheet" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
and since that meta referrer is not applied to preloads that seems like expected behavior to me.
Using latest mozilla-central:
I only see one request which does not leak the referrer. I don't know what happenend, but it seems we are not performing a preload for that request anymore.
Either way, I think the behavior described in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Referrer leaked even after setting referrer policy attribute") is expected behavior.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

|  | |

Not sure I agree: if we have a referrer policy to block referrers, or a CSP to block content loads, or mixed content blocking to block mixed content, the preloader shouldn't get to willy-nilly ignore those constraints. In this case the referrerpolicy is right there on the element itself.

This bug is probably on the way to being closed "works for me", but can we add a referrer policy test that makes sure we don't get two referrers, or that if we do they are both following the appropriate policy? Probably want to try different kinds of elements (some are more likely to be preloaded than others).

Since Firefox doesn't seem to use the referrer policy attribute in pre-loads those tests would fail. I opened [bug 1399780](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399780 "RESOLVED FIXED - Preloads ignore referrer polices") to investigate the general issue. This specific one seems "fixed".Flags: needinfo?(franziskuskiefer)

[Bug 1384493](/show_bug.cgi?id=1384493 "RESOLVED FIXED - dom/base/test/test_link_stylesheet.html fails when we enable rcwn, due to speculative loading style") is landed that fixed referrerpolicy attr in speculative loading link (preload style) in ff 57. The possible reason you will see 2 requests before landing this bug because speculative loading ignored the referrerpolicy attr, then the attr will be parsed later. We will consider they are 2 different requests (due to different referrer) then decide not to reuse, send again.

For me, it's fixed in Firefox 58.01 (stable) and Nightly (60.0a1).
But it's weird, I haven't tweeted the PoC link (<https://test.shhnjk.com/refpol.html>). Maybe I'm hacked :DFlags: needinfo?(s.h.h.n.j.k)

Ahh, I got it. The link you saw in [bug 1434791](/show_bug.cgi?id=1434791 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Referrer policy bypass") is Chrome bug which got fixed a week ago in <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=763194>
I didn't bother reporting it to Firefox because Firefox has worse bug ([bug 1397509](/show_bug.cgi?id=1397509 "RESOLVED FIXED - Referrer policy bypass with srcdoc")), which was marked as low :)
