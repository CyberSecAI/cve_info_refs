Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-7503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the implementation of `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory` in Red Hat JBoss EAP 7.0.5.
- Specifically, the issue is an XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The `TransformerFactory` is vulnerable to XXE attacks, which allow an attacker to manipulate XML processing to include external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can launch DoS attacks by exploiting the XML processing and causing excessive resource consumption.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can perform SSRF attacks, potentially gaining access to internal network resources.
- **File Reading:** An attacker can read files from the server where JBoss EAP is deployed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Untrusted XML Content:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing untrusted XML content.
- **TransformerFactory:** The `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory` is the vulnerable component involved in the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted XML content to the application.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker must be able to interact with an application that uses a vulnerable `TransformerFactory` to process XML data.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report mentions that fixing the issue in Xerces (the underlying XML parser) is difficult due to the nature of the required patch that includes many related changes in OpenJDK.
- It suggests removing Xerces from EAP as a possible but difficult alternative.
- It recommends using the StAX API as a safe way to process untrusted XML content because the XML content is not read in its entirety.
- The vulnerability was addressed in EAP-CD 14 Tech Preview via RHSA-2020:2563.
- A mitigation for the vulnerability is also provided, explaining that the only safe way to process untrusted XML content with a `TransformerFactory` is to use the StAX API, as it does not automatically process XXE control constructs.

This is more detailed than the placeholder description provided in the CVE, clearly defining the vulnerable component, how to trigger the vulnerability and the impact of the attack.
