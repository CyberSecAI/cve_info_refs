Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `verify.php` file of MantisBT. The code responsible for verifying account activation or password reset requests incorrectly handles cases where the `confirm_hash` parameter is empty.

Specifically, the original vulnerable code was:
```php
if( $f_confirm_hash != $t_token_confirm_hash ) {
  trigger_error( ERROR_LOST_PASSWORD_CONFIRM_HASH_INVALID, ERROR );
}
```
This code only checks if `$f_confirm_hash` is not equal to `$t_token_confirm_hash`, but doesn't account for when `$f_confirm_hash` is an empty string which results in bypassing the security check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Hash Comparison:** The code uses a loose comparison (`!=`) instead of a strict comparison (`!==`) and lacks a check for a null or empty `$t_token_confirm_hash` value. This allows bypassing the verification if an empty `confirm_hash` is supplied.
*   **Pre-Authentication Password Reset:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger the password reset functionality for any user account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Hijacking:** An attacker can reset the password of any user, including administrator accounts. This gives the attacker full access to the MantisBT instance.
*   **Data Breach:** With administrative access, an attacker can potentially access and manipulate sensitive data within the MantisBT system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a specific URL including the victim's user ID and an empty `confirm_hash` value. Example: `http://<target>/verify.php?id=1&confirm_hash=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the MantisBT instance.
*   **User ID Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know or guess the user ID of the account they wish to compromise, although the default administrator ID is often '1'.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects MantisBT versions >= 1.3.0 up to 2.3.0, while 1.2.x is not affected.
*   The fix involves checking if `$t_token_confirm_hash` is null and also using a strict comparison (`!==`).
The patched code is:
```php
if( $t_token_confirm_hash == null || $f_confirm_hash !== $t_token_confirm_hash ) {
  trigger_error( ERROR_LOST_PASSWORD_CONFIRM_HASH_INVALID, ERROR );
}
```
*   The vulnerability is described as a "Pre-Auth Remote Password Reset" issue.
*   The vulnerability was reported by John Page aka hyp3rlinx.
*   A proof of concept (POC) exploit is available.
