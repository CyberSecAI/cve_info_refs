| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-18 09:24:03 UTC  ``` It was found that log viewer for a pod doesn't properly handle terminal escape characters and automatic generation of clickable links from output, leading to XSS vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-04-18 09:24:12 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jeandre Le Roux (LSD Information Technology)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c12)  Yadan Pei    2018-04-17 01:49:30 UTC  ``` Could you also share the reproducer to me as well so QE could verify the fix?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c13)  Yadan Pei    2018-04-17 02:36:14 UTC  ``` Cancelling the request because I've got the reproducer from xiaoli   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c15)  Shawn Wells    2018-07-10 23:09:35 UTC  ``` Hello - Friendly nudge on this. Is there a timeline for when this CVE will be patched?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c16)  Shawn Wells    2018-07-10 23:11:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Shawn Wells from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c15)) > Hello - Friendly nudge on this. Is there a timeline for when this CVE will > be patched?  Context: Customer is doing a security evaluation of OpenShift and we're getting dinged on OpenShift having known XSS vulnerabilities that have remained unpatched for several months. Red Hat's ability to provide security patches for products is being challenged.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c20)  Jason Shepherd    2018-07-11 23:45:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been fixed in: - 3.9 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:1566](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1566) - 3.7 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:1576](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1576) - 3.6 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:1579](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1579) - 3.4 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:1236](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1236)  Unfortunately those errata were not done as security errata so the CVE page has not been automatically updated with the links.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c21)  Shawn Wells    2018-07-19 03:49:23 UTC  ``` Thanks for the fast responses everyone! Immediate needs were addressed.  Since errata was issued for this BZ, how do we get it closed? Currently shows as a public (known) vulnerability for OpenShift. Thanks to Jason's comments we can now point to security errata though!   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c22)  Brenton Leanhardt    2018-07-19 18:30:55 UTC  ``` We apologize for the confusion around this bug and we've taken steps to avoid it in the future.  If there's anything needed from us to update the CVE page just let us know.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c23)  Shawn Wells    2018-07-19 18:36:38 UTC  ``` Currently NIST shows this CVE as having no patches from Red Hat: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7534>  The NIST page does point back to this BZ so truly interested parties can read the discussion and get the errata links. However because NIST shows no patches as being released customers are still getting vulnerability reports showing OpenShift was never patched/currently is vulnerable. Means each OpenShift deployment that's being scanned with tools like Tenable Security Center have to track this down.  I think there are two questions: - How do we get the NIST webpage updated to reflect patches were released? - How do we get Red Hat's CVE page [0] updated to reflect patches were released?  [0] <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-7534>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c24)  Dominik Mierzejewski    2018-08-06 14:34:57 UTC  ``` Is 3.2 affected by this, too?   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c25)  Jason Shepherd    2018-08-07 00:58:47 UTC  ``` It was decided that OCP 3.2 was not affected because this is actually a problem in ansi_up, not in the openshift code itself.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1443003#c26)  Samuel Padgett    2018-08-07 15:28:31 UTC  ``` ansi_up was added to OpenShift web console in 3.2, so 3.2 is affected.   ``` |  |
