Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the MXView server's failure to properly handle excessively long strings in the user ID and password fields during login attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The web interface does not validate or limit the length of user-provided input for login credentials. This allows an attacker to submit arbitrarily large strings.
- **Denial of Service:** The lack of proper input handling leads to a denial-of-service condition when the server attempts to process extremely large login strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause the MXView server to become unresponsive or crash by sending a large string of characters in the login credentials, thus preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network by sending malicious HTTP POST requests to the `/goform/account` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target MXView server.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability exists within the login process, so no authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code uses `urllib` and `urllib2` to send a POST request to `/goform/account` with a large string of 'A's as both the username ('uid') and password ('pwd').
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
- The vendor was notified on March 5, 2017 and released an update on April 7, 2017. The public disclosure occurred on April 9, 2017.
- The vulnerable product is Moxa MXView v2.8.
