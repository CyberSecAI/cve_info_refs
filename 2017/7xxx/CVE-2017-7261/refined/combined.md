On some distributions this device is readable and writable by unprivileged users. On RHEL and Fedora this is restricted to root:video only, but console graphics user  (i.e. one used graphic login at the system console) is also granted permissions to read/write to this file.  In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), a 'num_sizes' parameter is assigned a value one can control through 'mip_levels' array provided from a userspace. This gets checked to ensure it is not too big, but it is not checked if it is zero:  >        num_sizes = 0; >        for (i = 0; i < DRM_VMW_MAX_SURFACE_FACES; ++i) >                num_sizes += req->mip_levels[i]; >  >        if (num_sizes > DRM_VMW_MAX_SURFACE_FACES * >            DRM_VMW_MAX_MIP_LEVELS) >                return -EINVAL;  This is later used in a call to memdup_user() and kmalloc_array():  >        srf->num_sizes = num_sizes; >        srf->sizes = memdup_user((struct drm_vmw_size __user *)(unsigned long) >                                 req->size_addr, >                                 sizeof(*srf->sizes) * srf->num_sizes); >        srf->offsets = kmalloc_array(srf->num_sizes, >                                     sizeof(*srf->offsets), >                                     GFP_KERNEL);  which won't return NULL, but does return ZERO_SIZE_PTR, refer to <https://lwn.net/Articles/236920/> for background information on this:  > #define ZERO_SIZE_PTR ((void *)16)  Later ZERO_SIZE_PTR is dereferenced which leads to a GPF and possibly to a kernel panic:  >        srf->base_size = *srf->sizes;   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1435719#c2)  Vladis Dronov    2017-03-24 16:03:03 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1435740](show_bug.cgi?id=1435740 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-7261 kernel: drm/vmwgfx: check that number of mip levels is above zero [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1435719#c4)  Vladis Dronov    2017-03-24 16:12:12 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the code with the flaw is not present in this product.

# [PATCH] drm/vmwgfx: Check check that number of mip levels is above zero in vmw\_surface\_define\_ioctl()

```
In vmw_surface_define_ioctl(), a num_sizes parameter is assigned a
user-controlled value which is not checked for zero. It is used in
a call to kmalloc() which returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR. Later ZERO_SIZE_PTR
is dereferenced which leads to a GPF and possibly to a kernel panic.
Add the check for zero to avoid this.
