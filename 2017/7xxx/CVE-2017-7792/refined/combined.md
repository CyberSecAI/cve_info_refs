| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8872576&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86\_64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170420084331
Steps to reproduce:
View a cert with a really long OID.
You can reproduce using attached file cp-bigoid.pem. Go to certificate import dialog,
then "View Cert".
Actual results:
The GetDefaultOIDFormat printing function overflows the buffer, causing
segfault.
Expected results:
The OID should have been printed properly.
Or at the very least, Firefox should not have crashed :)

[Bug 1368652: fix buffer overflow caused by long OIDs](attachment.cgi?id=8872581) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8872581&action=edit)

If an OID is too long for the buffer, the buffer is overwritten and
can cause segfault. Update GetDefaultOIDFormat to avoid overwriting
the buffer. Track the required size and allocate a new buffer if the
OID is too large for the default buffer, then try again, freeing the
new buffer at the end.

It's good practice to file buffer overflow bugs as security-sensitive until they're investigated and fixed.Group: crypto-core-security

I believe this was caused by [bug 1197314](/show_bug.cgi?id=1197314 "RESOLVED FIXED - remove PR_snprintf calls in security/manager/ssl/"). If snprintf is given a string that does not fit in the given buffer, it doesn't overflow the buffer, but it returns the size of of what it would have written. PR\_snprintf returns what it did write.
This is almost certainly exploitable, but it requires some user interaction. I think it could be done with some simple timing-based click-jacking, though, hence sec-high.Assignee: nobody → dkeelerBlocks: [1197314](/show_bug.cgi?id=1197314 "RESOLVED FIXED - remove PR_snprintf calls in security/manager/ssl/")

It's possible, it was just a guess from me.
Is there a reason why the entire browser crashes even with e10s enabled?

I think the offending code is in the parent process rather than the child, so the whole browser goes down.

Yes, you will need to ask for sec-approval. We are getting close to release (the RC 54 build is next week).

Yeah, I suppose I should have split this into two patches from the start.

Attached patch

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8873571&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1368652&attachment=8873571)

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Fairly easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The test is in a separate patch now. The check-in comment is a bit vague.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All (except esr45 if that hasn't already been eol'd)
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 1197314](/show_bug.cgi?id=1197314 "RESOLVED FIXED - remove PR_snprintf calls in security/manager/ssl/") (landed in 47)
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This applies cleanly to nightly, aurora, and beta. I'll prepare a patch for esr52 (which I think will also apply to release, but I'm assuming we're not going to do a dot release at this point). (The patch for esr52 should be straight-forward and not risky.)
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not very likely, and in any case this is a rarely-used informational-only feature, so even if it ceases to display the right result, it's better than RCE.

I think this may have missed the window to make the Firefox 54 release, which means checkin will be delayed at least a few weeks.

I was able to reproduce the crash [1] on an affected build (54.0.1, 20170628145605, 90f18f9c15f7) using the test case from [Comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1368652#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - GetDefaultOIDFormat: buffer overflow caused by long OIDs") on Ubuntu 16.04 x64.
The crash is no longer occurring on Ubuntu 16.04 x64, Windows 10 x64 and macOS 10.12 using the following builds:
- 55.0 (20170731163142, aa08b24ffb91)
- 56.0a1 (20170731175927, 87824406b9fe)
- 52.2esr (20170731051123, 8e0ad123ef5e)
But there's a questionable behavior when opening the certificate in some cases: the "Downloading Certificate" dialog is not displayed, instead the epm file's page source is shown in the tab [2]. It happens on Ubuntu (only on 56.0a1) and Windows 10 (52.2esr, 55.0 and 56.0a1) on my machine. I'm not seeing it on macOS at all. David, is this expected?

That's unexpected. Another way to verify would be to download the file and import it via the certificate manager (about:preferences -> Advanced or Privacy & Security, depending on the version of Firefox -> Certificates -> View Certificates -> Authorities -> Import).
Can you file a bug on the behavior you're seeing? (it may just be a server issue - I think the feature depends on the mime type the server sends)Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Masayuki Nakano, Gary Kwong, Ronald Crane, Andrew McCreight, Tyson Smith, Bevis Tseng, Christian Holler, Bryce Van Dyk, Dragana Damjanovic, Kartikaya Gupta, Philipp, Tristan Bourvon, and Andi-Bogdan Postelnicu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 54 and Firefox ESR 52.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[source\_and\_results.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8881398)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8881398&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_12\_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/61.0.3142.0 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
It seems like the specification of how App Cache is working is a lot less restrictive compared to Service Workers.
The following scenarios are possible using an App-Cache manifest in Firefox:
1. a file below a path (u/XYZ) can set FALLBACK for the complete origin
2. an SVG-file can set a manifest (even if mime is image/svg+xml)
3. an XML can set manifest (using xmlns=xhtml)
4. a manifest can be served on any content-type (spec says must be text/application-cache)
This currently affects a bunch of file serving services which uses sandboxed origins (exampleusercontent.com) but still serve inline content on the sandboxed domains. By triggering a cookie-bomb combined with a manifest, you're able to hijack any URL on the sandboxed domain using FALLBACK independently if the files are served from a sub-path on the domain.
Manifest should (probably) not be possible to set from a subfolder onto the complete origin (this will probably break a bunch of apps tho)
Setting a manifest should probably be restricted to text/html only.
I've set up a test environment at <http://avlidienbrunn.se/appcache/tests.html>, see attached for full source code and results from other browsers.
FYI:
Chrome fixes:
1: Temporary fix by requiring Content-Type "text/application-cache" for setting FALLBACK outside of the current path, due to breaking existing apps. Currently tracked as 422987.
2: Chose not to fix
3: Chose not to fix
4: Chose not to fix (except in case #1)
Actual results:
1. Manifest was loaded
2. Manifest was loaded
3. Manifest was loaded
4. Manifest was loaded
Expected results:
1. Manifest was not loaded
2. Manifest was not loaded
3. Manifest was not loaded
4. Manifest was not loaded

Honza: ah, thanks for the info.
It's been 3 years since the bug you linked, and this attack scenario is affecting a lot of sites now:
1. USER visits ATTACKERSITE
2. ATTACKERSITE poisons cache on s3.amazonaws.com by loading a manifest + cookie bomb on <https://s3.amazonaws.com/attacker/example.html>
3. (some time later) USER visits SITE
4. USER uploads FILE
5. SITE puts FILE on S3
6. USER accesses FILE from SITE like <https://s3.amazonaws.com/companybucket/userxyz/file?X-Amz-Signature=EXAMPLE>
7. USER instead loads ATTACKER's fallback page, which leaks the X-Amz-Signature
8. FILE is leaked to ATTACKER
Any chance for reconsideration? Has there been any update regarding deprecation of appcache (I am guessing that is "current appcache forecast")?Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

nsHttpChannel::ProcessFallback can perform the check that the fallback target URI is under the same path as the manifest is. I need to find the proper tools to test this.
Valentin, do you know some simple (or less simple) way how to check if a URI is in a (sub-)path of another URI? Do we have any helpers? Are there any escaping considerations (/ -> %something) that would prevent us from the correct recognition of it?Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz) → needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

We have nsIURL.directory - which returns the path excluding the current file.
So I assume checking if it's a subpath would be something like url1.directory.startsWith(url2.directory) or close to it.
Percent encoding may affect this. file:///etc%2Fzsh\_command\_not\_found is essentially equivalent to file:///etc/zsh\_command\_not\_found
I don't recall if we already have a bug for this, but we should probably fix it.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

Attached patch

[v1 (FALLBACK but be inside manifest dir)](attachment.cgi?id=8883079&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8883079&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1376459&attachment=8883079)

- during the manifest parsing we ignore FALLBACK namespace and the fallback page when they are not under the manifest's directory
- and since we have appcaches out there that already have these evil FALLBACK entries cached, we also do a secondary check in http channel for both the namespace and the fallback page
No test, I'm lazy... Tested locally for both the parser and the http channel check.

A little odd to not return a bool for a "IsFoo()" function, but no big deal.

According [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1376459#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - AppCache issues (served on subpath allowed to set FALLBACK for whole origin, allowed to set on svg/xml)") which seems plausible, this is sec-high IMO.

It does affect old branches. I believe this is backportable easily (the fix is relatively simple). Not sure if fixing this would draw larger attention to this issue or not. If yes, we may want to uplift.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

v1.1 (FALLBACK but be inside manifest dir)
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: sensitive data disclosure possibility, cache poisoning
User impact if declined: as above
Fix Landed on Version: 56
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): hard to assess, this could break some sites using appcache and refering some resources not at/under the appcache manifest path on the server ; hard to say sooner than on m-b/m-r since this is not widely used web tech anymore
String or UUID changes made by this patch: none
See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process> for more info.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: not a regression
[User impact if declined]: sensitive data disclosure possibility, cache poisoning
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: we have tests for the functionality apparently passing on m-c
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: yes, I think
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: probably [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1376459#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - AppCache issues (served on subpath allowed to set FALLBACK for whole origin, allowed to set on svg/xml)"), but there is no life test demo available
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none
[Is the change risky?]: regarding crash rate, no ; regarding web compat, somewhat for badly written pages
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: patch is simple enough

This is a rather large patch that shouldn't have been checked into trunk without security approval. I don't think we can take this in 55 and ESR52 (for this cycle) with a single beta left.

There was no sec rating done on this bug prior landing it.
Note that this is a known issue and we have an open (by means of not security sensitive) bug for it already - [comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=1376459#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - AppCache issues (served on subpath allowed to set FALLBACK for whole origin, allowed to set on svg/xml)").

Could making [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1376459#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - AppCache issues (served on subpath allowed to set FALLBACK for whole origin, allowed to set on svg/xml)") and 5 hidden help here? According what I read in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1376459#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - AppCache issues (served on subpath allowed to set FALLBACK for whole origin, allowed to set on svg/xml)"), this broke sites when landed in chrome.
Maybe we end up backing this out. It's been on Nightly for 14 days so far, tho.

Yes, and per bug approval policy for security bugs, if it has no security rating and affects more than trunk, it \*requires\* a security rating before it can be checked in.

The concern with security approval is that people watch our checkins and reverse engineer them. The genie is out of the bottle now and backing it out won't help with that.

(One note - I got used to the "sec approval needed" note here in bugzilla, not seeing it left me believe there was nothing blocking me; maybe sec bugs w/o a sec-\* keyword should have that notification too?)

Probably a good idea!

v1.1 (FALLBACK but be inside manifest dir)
I want to make a simpler patch to backport with added preference so we can disable this in case sites get broken.
Al, the effective part of this patch are the changes to nsHttpChannel.cpp, only. That's what prevents the attack.
The parts in the offline manifest are there only to prevent caching of manifests that are found broken (potentially trying to inject the attack).

Approval Request Comment - see [comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=1376459#c16 "RESOLVED FIXED - AppCache issues (served on subpath allowed to set FALLBACK for whole origin, allowed to set on svg/xml)").
This adds the check only to the http channel (we disallow fallback when the namespace or the resource is outside the manifest path) and \*doesn't\* fail the cache update process (under the same conditions).
This also adds a deliberately hidden preference users can switch in an emergency if some safe sites get broken with this patch. (Not sure this bit needs a review or not.)Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu
Impact
low
##### Description

On Windows systems, if non-null-terminated strings are copied into the crash reporter for some specific registry keys, stack memory data can be copied until a null is found. This can potentially contain private data from the local system.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not affected.*

Reporter
Matt Howell
Impact
low
##### Description

On Windows systems, the logger run by the Windows updater deletes the file "update.log" before it runs in order to write a new log of that name. The path to this file is supplied at the command line to the updater and could be used in concert with another local exploit to delete a different file named "update.log" instead of the one intended.

Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer
overflows and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, denial of service, bypass of the same-origin policy or
incorrect enforcement of CSP.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 52.3.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.3.0esr-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.
