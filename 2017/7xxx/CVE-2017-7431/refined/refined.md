**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker would need to entice a logged-in iManager user to visit a malicious website or click on a crafted link that triggers the XSRF attack.
*   This could be achieved through social engineering or by injecting the malicious code into a trusted website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page or link.
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated iManager user into accessing this malicious resource.

**Additional Details:**
