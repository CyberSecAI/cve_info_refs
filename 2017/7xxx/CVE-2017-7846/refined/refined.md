Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-7846:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Thunderbird processes RSS feeds when viewed as a website (e.g., via "View -> Feed article -> Website").  Specifically, it was possible to embed and execute JavaScript within the feed content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **JavaScript Execution in RSS Feeds:** Thunderbird was not properly sanitizing or restricting the content loaded through `<link>` tags in RSS feeds.  This allowed an attacker to inject JavaScript by using a `data:` URL within the link tag.
*   **Bypassed Same-Origin Policy (SOP):**  When a `<link>` element was present, Thunderbird would load the linked content and allow it to execute Javascript within the `mailbox://` origin, which is a higher privilege environment and this bypass of SOP could allow access to other parts of Thunderbird.
*   **Data URI Handling:** Thunderbird incorrectly parsed data: URIs, loading the HTML defined in them and allowing script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject JavaScript code that would execute in the context of Thunderbird's `mailbox://` origin with access to privileged APIs.
*   **Potential for Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially use JavaScript to extract sensitive information from other parts of Thunderbird if the same origin policy bypass is leveraged. This is possible due to the `mailbox://` origin having access to other Thunderbird resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RSS Feed:** An attacker would need to create a malicious RSS feed that contains a `<link>` element with a `data:` URL injecting JavaScript.
*   **User Interaction:** A user would have to open this RSS feed in Thunderbird and view it as a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Feed Creation:** The attacker would need to create or have the ability to inject the malicious content into an RSS feed.
*   **Feed Delivery:** The attacker would have to entice a Thunderbird user to subscribe to and open this feed.
*   **No Special Position:** No special network or system access would be needed other than delivering the malicious feed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved sanitizing the `<link>` tag, disallowing all `non-http` URLs (including `data:` uris) from being stored in the mail header and from being loaded by the embedded browser component.
*   The vulnerability was primarily an issue for Thunderbird versions before 57, as versions 57 and newer implement origin isolation for `data:` uris, thus preventing exploitation of the incorrect parsing of the data URL. However, the fix was backported to ESR52 versions of Thunderbird to ensure complete security coverage.
*   There was initial discussion of whether the fix was a security fix, and whether it should be approved by a security team, but ultimately it was decided to handle it as a regular bug fix and include in a later Thunderbird update.

The information from the provided documents indicates that this vulnerability was successfully addressed in subsequent Thunderbird releases.
