- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected product reuses nonces in encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reusing a nonce in encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can capture and replay a valid request until the nonce is changed, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, by capturing and replaying network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic. User interaction is required to initiate the valid request to be replayed.
