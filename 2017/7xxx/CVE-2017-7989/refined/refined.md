- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate mime type checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  ACL (Access Control List) violation due to insufficient validation of file types during upload. Specifically, low-privilege users were able to upload SWF files even when explicitly forbidden by access control configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows low-privilege users to upload unauthorized file types (specifically SWF), potentially leading to further attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) or other malicious activities if the uploaded SWF files can be executed by other users.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading SWF files through the Joomla CMS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker needs to be a low-privilege user within the Joomla system with the ability to upload files.
