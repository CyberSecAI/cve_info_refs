Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in WebKit's JavaScriptCore (JSC) engine, specifically within the `BytecodeGenerator::emitGetByVal` function.
- The function uses a fast path optimization, `op_get_direct_pname`, when the index variable in an expression like "o[i]" appears to be a string. However, if the type of the index variable is later changed (e.g., to an integer or an array) the fast path will continue to use `op_get_direct_pname` even when it is not appropriate, leading to type confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Type confusion due to incorrect optimization in `BytecodeGenerator::emitGetByVal`.
- The fast path optimization `op_get_direct_pname` is used even when the index is no longer a string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution
- Denial of service (as stated in Exploit-DB)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing maliciously crafted web content that triggers the vulnerable code path within WebKit's JavaScript engine.
- Exploiting the vulnerability through JavaScript code that manipulates index variables within loops.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious web content to the victim's browser or application using the vulnerable WebKit engine.
- No special network privileges required.

**Technical Details:**

The `BytecodeGenerator::emitGetByVal` method is responsible for handling expressions such as "o[i]". It attempts an optimization where if the index "i" appears to be a string, it uses the `op_get_direct_pname` opcode, designed for string indexes only. However, the optimization does not properly track type changes in loop contexts. If the index variable's type changes during the loop execution the opcode remains the same, causing a type confusion.

The exploit example provided from Exploit-DB shows how changing the type of the index variable within nested loops triggers the vulnerability:

```javascript
let o = {};
for (let i in {xx: 0}) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        o[i];  // When j == 1, op_get_direct_pname was already emitted, but i is not a string anymore.
        i = 0;
    }
}
```

and the proof of concept:

```javascript
let o = {};
for (let i in {xx: 0}) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        o[i];
        i = new Uint32Array([0, 1, 0x777777, 0, 0]);
    }
}
```
