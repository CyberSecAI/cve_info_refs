Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7064:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `JSArray::appendMemcpy` function within the WebKit JavaScriptCore (JSC) engine.
- The function copies data from one JavaScript array to another using `memcpy`.
- The issue arises when the source array (`otherArray`) has an `ArrayWithUndecided` type, which could contain uninitialized memory.  `JSArray::appendMemcpy` doesn't properly check for this and proceeds with the copy anyway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Uninitialized Memory Copy:** The core vulnerability is copying uninitialized memory. The `memcpy` operation copies data from `otherArray`'s buffer to the destination array's buffer, even if the source buffer contains uninitialized values. This occurs if `otherArray` is of type `ArrayWithUndecided` and it is filled with garbage data.
- **Type Confusion:** The code logic does not handle `ArrayWithUndecided` type properly during `memcpy` operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Copying uninitialized memory can lead to disclosure of potentially sensitive information residing in the heap.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The exploit can potentially cause a crash when attempting to read from this uninitialized memory. This is explicitly noted in the exploit-db entry.
- **Memory Corruption:** Although not explicitly stated as leading to arbitrary code execution in this particular CVE description, this type of memory corruption can potentially be chained with other exploits for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Content:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing maliciously crafted web content.
- **JavaScript:** The exploit relies on JavaScript code that manipulates arrays in a specific manner that triggers the vulnerable `JSArray::appendMemcpy` code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious JavaScript code to the vulnerable system, typically via a website visited by the user.
- No special user privileges are needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit-db entry provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) JavaScript code that demonstrates how to trigger this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was identified by lokihardt of Google Project Zero.

In summary, CVE-2017-7064 is a vulnerability in WebKit's JavaScriptCore engine where copying uninitialized memory during array operations can lead to information disclosure or denial of service. It can be triggered by visiting a website with malicious JavaScript.
