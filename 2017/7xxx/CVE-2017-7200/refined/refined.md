Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `copy_from` feature of the Glance Image Service API v1. This feature allows users to specify a URL from which an image should be copied. The vulnerability arises because this URL is not validated, which allows users to provide URLs pointing to internal network resources like `http://localhost:22`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is that the `copy_from` functionality allows an attacker to make the Glance server perform requests to arbitrary URLs.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of validation or sanitization of the provided URL in the `copy_from` parameter.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By using URLs pointing to internal resources, attackers can potentially scan ports and discover services running on the internal network that would otherwise not be accessible.
*   **Unverified Content:** The `copy_from` feature retrieves remote content without verification which means malicious content can be copied. (Though this is not considered a high risk)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Network Port Scanning:** Attackers can use the Glance server as a proxy to perform network port scans, potentially identifying open ports and services running on internal systems.
*   **Internal Network Discovery:** The ability to scan internal networks through the Glance server can allow attackers to map out the network topology and identify vulnerable targets within the internal infrastructure.
*   **Circumventing Access Controls:** By leveraging the Glance server to initiate connections to internal resources, attackers can potentially circumvent network-level access controls.
*  **Malicious Content Storage**: While less of a concern, the feature can copy malicious content to the glance store

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Request:** The attack vector is through the Glance API v1 `copy_from` feature. Attackers would use a crafted API request that specifies a malicious URL in the `copy_from` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Glance API:** Attackers need to have access to the Glance API v1 to send requests that use the vulnerable `copy_from` functionality. This typically means having credentials to interact with the OpenStack cloud.
*   **Knowledge of Internal Network:** While not strictly necessary, knowledge of the internal network layout would make the port scanning more effective.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the v1 API of the Glance Image Service, which was deprecated in the Newton release.
*   The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to Glance API v2.
*   A workaround in v1 is to restrict the `copy_from` policy to `admin` users in `policy.json`.
*   The `copy_from` policy can be set to `role:admin` to restrict this feature to administrator users only.
