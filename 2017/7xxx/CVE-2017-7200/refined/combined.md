# copy\_from in api v1 allows network port scan

### Bug Description

copy\_from allows to create Images with an url like <http://localhost:22>

The remote content gets copied unverified in the defined glance store.

E.g. after downloading the image with copy\_from url <http://localhost:22>, you see the OpenSSH banner.

This is a security issue, as it allows users to do network "scans" for open ports and it copies remote (potentially malicious) content unverified to your configured glance store.

glance api v1 is still the default in horizon.

Yep, copy\_from is dangerous, that's why it's not in the v2 API and one reason why the v1 API will be deprecated in Newton.

As far as malicious content goes, it does make it easier for an end user to be tricked (they just need to know the URL) and Glance will go get it for them. But if a cloud allows end users to upload image data, the end user can simply download from the URL and then upload the payload. Thus I don't see it as being much different from the current situation.

The port scanner is an interesting case as it can expose information about what ports are in use on the server running Glance. I don't know whether it could reveal info that couldn't be discovered by other means. Someone else will have to answer that.

@Brian,

I think the port scan issue is that it allows a (more) masked port scan since the scan would come from glance. At the very least it could be utilized to scan resources that are not available externally because glance may talk on internal interfaces to other cloud-systems. This may expose information about what to attack once access to the internal networks are breached.

Secondarily it could be used to proxy-scan other hosts that are not part of the current cloud deployment. This could be used as a means to mask the real origin of the scan.

Could the info be found via other means? Yes, in some cases.

@Morgan,

Thanks for the additional info on the port scan issue.

My opinion is that this is a "won't fix" as a bug, since v1 is going to be deprecated and the functionality isn't present in v2. But that's just my opinion, we'll have to see what others think.

Was v1 already deprecated for Liberty & Mitaka If not than this might be a valid security bug for this stable releases.

If v1 is deprecated, than this is a horizon bug, which does only support v1. There is a blueprint open [https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/horizon-glance-v2](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bspec/horizon-glance-v2)

But until this gets implemented a horizon config option, which disables the copy\_from URL input form, might be very helpful to address this issue.

Tom, you are right, the deprecation of v1 won't happen until Newton, so this will be a problem in the stable releases for a few cycles.

A horizon option to disable copy\_from sounds like a good idea to me.

On the Glance side, there is an existing "upload\_image" policy that blocks copy\_from -- but it also blocks any other functionality for uploading image data, and it affects both the v1 and v2 APIs.

It seems like this bug can't be fixed with a non breaking stable branch fix. Perhaps it can be covered by the eventual OSSN about glance image creation ?

How about adding a "src\_store" blacklist option to prevent connections to localhost and management networks ?

Ahh there is a copy\_from policy for glance - which allows to restrict this action to certain roles, like admin. I think this is sufficient to circumvent.

@tom-patzig: you are correct, don't know how I missed that. Yes, an existing solution for this is to restrict the copy\_from policy to admins or trusted users.

And I should mention, I tested this in devstack. Setting the policy to:

"copy\_from": "role:admin"

allowed my admin user to use copy-from with v1, whereas my demo user got a 403.

Yep, this seems like a pretty clear-cut SSRF type issue. Since Glance typically sits on a privileged network in many deployments an attacker could use this to enumerate internal network details.

Agree embargoed note is the right thing to do to give deployers a chance to flip the switch/validate the switch is already flipped.

The VMT is being asked questions about this report by a vendor servicing the organization who reported it. Is there any benefit in continuing to keep this under embargo? Is the planned OSSN nearly ready, or should we go ahead and let that process continue in public at this point?

I'm not sure where Luke or Travis are in writing up an OSSN, but I'd caution against mentioning this part of the original bug report:

> it copies remote (potentially malicious) content unverified to your configured glance store.

Glance regularly deals in potentially malicious and unverified content. If any user can upload image data than all of that data could be malicious or unverified. Unless your Nova compute nodes, however, can run any type of virtualization the actual effect of that malicious content is dubious. The image data is never displayed in Horizon, so there's no XSS or other attacks possible there. The image data isn't excecuted on download by Glance client on any of the hosts or on a user's machine. For it to be executed, the user would have to take those steps directly and if they know Glance is the \*image\* service, I doubt they'd try to execute an image. So, like a separate issue we had reported, I'm unsure what people's threat model is around this.

As to whether or not to keep this under embargo, I'd vote it's pointless. There is no fix. And the OSSN might be written faster without the embargo.

Agree with Ian. We should focus on the port-scanner aspect of this report.

An operator can restrict copy-from to privileged users by setting the copy\_from policy appropriately. We recommend that this be done in deployments where the copy-from functionality could be used as a port scanner as described in the bug.

# Add a policy to control copy-from functionality

### Bug Description

It might be useful to have a policy to control whether the copy-from functionality can be used or not, eg:

$ cat /etc/glance/policy.json

{

    "default": "",

    "manage\_image\_cache": "role:admin",

    "publicize\_image": "role:admin",

    "copy\_from": "role:admin" <<<

}

this would allow an operator to enable/disable the copy-from functionality for regular users, and if desired, prevent data being copied from 'external' sources.

Is there ever a reason to have "copy\_from" restrict differently than "image\_upload"? I suspect the answer is yes, but I want to understand why.

Mark, here are a couple of reasons that I thought of (tho none come from a real world scenario that I have seen):

A malicious user could use copy\_from functionality to use Glance to download data and avoid having their IP address known/logged/blocked.

Host based authentication could be put in place by a repository such that the Glance server is the only endpoint allowed to download data, thus copy\_from (or --location) would be the only way for users to access it. An admin may want to limit what users could access it.

This question dovetails into another that I had. Should there be a whitelist or blacklist of host/urls with which Glance will allow the use of copy\_from or location?

Mark, here are a couple of reasons that I thought of (tho none come from a real world scenario that I have seen):

Hi Mark,

The copy\_from policy could be considered one of the pieces required to support an implied policy: only allow data upload/download via the API endpoint. ie if you combine it with set\_image\_location and also pare down the 'known\_stores'

store types this is the behaviour you get.

Why might you want to turn off copy\_from?

1) Network hardware: you may want all data to be pushed through your load balancers/rate limiters. The copy from means uploaded data would go straight to your server, bypassing the usual upload path

2) Secure sites: You may have a site policy mandating that all traffic uses SSL. If the swift store is enabled you could copy from a plain http swift store .

## copy\_from in Image Service API v1 allows network port scan

### Summary

The `copy\_from` feature in Image Service API v1 supplied by Glance can
allow an attacker to perform masked network port scans.

### Affected Services / Software

Version 1 of the Glance Image Service (deprecated in Newton).

### Discussion

In Version 1 of the Glance Image Service API it is possible to create
images with a URL such as `<http://localhost:22`>. This could then allow
an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing
masked, since the scan would appear to originate from the Glance image
service.

### Recommended Actions

Version 1 of the Glance Image Service API was deprecated in the Newton
cycle, so operators should upgrade to a later version that will allow
use of Version 2.

Existing deployments can limit policy on `copy\_from` by restricting use
to `admin` within `policy.json` as follows:

```
   "copy_from": "role:admin"

```
