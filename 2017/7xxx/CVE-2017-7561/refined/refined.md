Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the RESTEasy CORS Filter. The filter failed to include the `Vary: Origin` header in HTTP responses. This omission allows for both client-side and server-side cache poisoning.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing `Vary` Header:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of the `Vary: Origin` header in responses when the CORS Filter is active. This header is essential because it signals to caches (both client and server) that the response might vary depending on the `Origin` header of the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cache Poisoning:**  Without the `Vary: Origin` header, caches may store and serve an incorrect response to a different origin. This can result in serving cached responses from one domain to requests from another. This could lead to:
    *   **Client-Side Cache Poisoning:** A malicious actor might inject harmful content that is then cached by the client browser which can cause persistent cross site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **Server-Side Cache Poisoning:** Intermediate caches (like proxy servers) could store and serve inappropriate content to other users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, the incorrect cached responses could leak sensitive information from one user to another.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would send a crafted HTTP request with both a `Host` and an `Origin` header. The `Origin` header needs to be a value that's configured as allowed by the `CorsFilter`, but different from the `Host`.
*   This could be achieved by using a malicious website or by manipulating requests from a trusted domain through a compromised client, which is made to send a request to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable RESTEasy application.
*   **Understanding CORS and Caching:** The attacker needs to be aware of how CORS works, and how the lack of `Vary` headers impacts HTTP caching.
*   **Knowledge of Target's Configuration:** The attacker needs to know the origins that the CORS filter considers to be allowed, in order to craft a valid request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in RESTEasy versions 3.0.7 and later, which include the vulnerable `CorsFilter`.
*   The fix involves adding the missing `Vary: Origin` header when the CORS Filter is used. This was addressed in RESTEasy 4.0.0.
*   Several Red Hat products including JBoss Enterprise Application Platform were affected and received updates to address this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2017-7561 allows for cache poisoning attacks due to a missing `Vary: Origin` header in RESTEasy's CORS Filter, which can lead to XSS, and information leaks. An attacker needs network access and understanding of the CORS filter, and HTTP caching to perform this attack.
