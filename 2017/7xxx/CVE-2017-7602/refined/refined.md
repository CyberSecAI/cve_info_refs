Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-7602:

**Root Cause:**

*   A signed integer overflow occurs during a calculation within the `TIFFReadRawStrip1()` function, specifically when handling the `isMapped()` case.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Signed Integer Overflow:** The core issue is that a calculation involving the `ma` and `size` variables results in an overflow of the `tmsize_t` data type, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security implications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The specific impact of the overflow is not clearly defined in the provided snippets. However, the Gentoo Security Advisory states that multiple vulnerabilities in LibTIFF, including this one, "could result in the execution of arbitrary code", "cause a Denial of Service condition", "obtain sensitive information, or have other unspecified impacts."
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice indicates that this vulnerability "could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a specially crafted file" leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
*   The commit message notes it is "avoid potential undefined behaviour".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted TIFF file. An attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a malicious TIFF image, triggering the integer overflow when the image is processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify TIFF files such that it triggers the overflow condition during processing.
*   The attacker would need to entice a user or automated system into processing this crafted TIFF file to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
*   The vulnerable code exists within the `libtiff/tif_read.c` file.
*   A patch for this issue was released on January 11, 2017.
*   The fix involves adding checks to ensure the calculations do not overflow and setting the number of bytes read `n` to zero if the size of the read would overflow the buffer.
*   The affected version is LibTIFF 4.0.7.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201709-27) indicates that versions prior to 4.0.8 are affected.

In summary, CVE-2017-7602 is a signed integer overflow vulnerability in LibTIFF that can be triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF file, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
