Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7468:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from libcurl's attempt to resume a TLS session even when the client certificate has changed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TLS Session Resumption Bypass:** libcurl improperly reuses TLS session information, potentially skipping client certificate verification during session resumption.
- This is a regression similar to CVE-2016-5419, affecting a different version range.
- By specification, servers are allowed to skip client certificate checks upon resumption and may instead rely on the identity established by the previous certificate. This creates an opportunity for bypassing certificate-based authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication bypass:** An attacker can potentially bypass intended client certificate authentication.
- An attacker might be able to impersonate a valid user if the server relies on certificate validation during the initial handshake, but not on resumption.
- The server may instead use the old identity, established by the previous certificate or no certificate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during TLS session resumption.
- An attacker can initiate a connection with a valid client certificate, establish a TLS session, then attempt to resume that session with a different or no certificate.
- Requires an attacker to interact with a server that uses client certificate authentication and supports TLS session resumption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to establish an initial TLS connection with a valid certificate.
- The attacker must be able to initiate a session resumption attempt.
- An attacker does not need to be in a privileged network position to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in curl versions prior to 7.54.0.
- The flaw is related to how libcurl handles TLS session resumption via TLS session IDs or tickets.
- The issue was identified as a regression, being similar to the previously reported CVE-2016-5419.
- The fix is to prevent libcurl from reusing TLS sessions when the client certificate has changed.
