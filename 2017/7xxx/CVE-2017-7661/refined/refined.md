- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Apache CXF Fediz Jetty and Spring plugins are vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks due to improper handling of the authentication process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability in the Spring 2, Spring 3, Jetty 8, and Jetty 9 plugins. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when the client starts the authentication process but does not complete it (e.g., when the IdP is unavailable). Additionally, the Jetty plugins are vulnerable even if the authentication process is completed, but the attack's scope is limited to the root context address.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a malicious client's roles being used for a given end-user, potentially granting unauthorized access and privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack relies on a malicious client initiating the authentication process but not completing it or by exploiting the vulnerability in the root context address for Jetty plugins, even when authentication is completed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate authentication requests, potentially needing to be on the same network as the vulnerable service.
