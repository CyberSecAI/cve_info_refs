Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7763:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes a security advisory (Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2017-15) that explicitly mentions:

*   **CVE-2017-7763:** "Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces"
    *   Description: "Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks."
    *   Reference: [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

This confirms that the provided content is directly related to CVE-2017-7763.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The root cause of this vulnerability is a flaw in how certain default fonts on macOS render specific Unicode characters (specifically Tibetan characters such as U+0F8C). Instead of displaying the character, the font renders it as whitespace (a space).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Domain Spoofing:** When these characters are used in a domain name within the address bar of a browser, the whitespace can make it appear as if a legitimate domain is being accessed, when in fact it is a malicious one. An attacker can use this to mask a spoofed domain, making it look identical to a real domain by embedding these whitespace characters.
    *   **IDN issue:** The vulnerability takes advantage of the way internationalized domain names (IDNs) are handled, specifically that a Tibetan character is not being displayed and rendered as space.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Address Bar Spoofing:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, due to the whitespace characters, appears to be a legitimate URL, leading users to believe they are visiting a trusted website.
    *   **Phishing:** Users may be tricked into entering sensitive information on a spoofed website, thinking they are interacting with the legitimate site.
    *  **Security Risk:** Users are put at a heightened risk as the malicious domain is not easily distinguishable from the legitimate domain, using whitespace to cloak it.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Crafted URLs:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL that contains the specific whitespace Unicode characters (U+0F8C).
    *   **IDN Domain Names:** The crafted URLs use these characters within an internationalized domain name (IDN).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Knowledge of Unicode Spoofing:** Attackers need awareness of how the specific Unicode characters are rendered on macOS.
    *   **Domain Name Control:** The attacker needs to own or control a domain name to construct the malicious URL.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Attackers may need to use social engineering techniques to encourage users to visit the malicious URLs.

**Additional Details from Bugzilla Comments:**
    *   **Affected Fonts:** The issue is caused by the "Songti SC", "Songti TC", and "STSong" fonts on macOS. These fonts incorrectly render the character as whitespace.
    *   **Mitigation:** The provided patch blacklists these specific codepoints in the identified fonts on macOS, causing them to render as a hexbox rather than whitespace.
    *   **Chrome has the same issue**: The bug report also mentions that Chrome has the same issue, and the reporter also urged them to blacklist these characters.
    *   **macOS Specific:** This issue only affects macOS due to how certain fonts render the Tibetan characters.
    *   **Testing:** The provided STR involves visiting `about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftest.shhnjk.com%2Fcsp_read.php`. The location bar should show `test.shhnjk.com`, and not show the userinfo segment such as `google,com@`.

**Additional Details from the bug comments:**
 * The issue was originally reported as incomplete fix of [Bug 1338867](/show_bug.cgi?id=1338867 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fennec allows address bar spoofing in reader view with userinfo field in front of hostname of url"). The issue was fixed in Android but not in Desktop browser.
* This issue is not a regression but rather a font issue in Apple's fonts.

**Summary:**

CVE-2017-7763 is a moderate severity domain spoofing vulnerability caused by a font issue in macOS. Attackers can craft URLs using specific Tibetan characters that are rendered as whitespace, making it difficult for users to distinguish between legitimate and malicious domains in the address bar. The fix involves a blacklist of the whitespace characters within those particular fonts, so that the characters are not rendered as a space, rather a hexbox.
