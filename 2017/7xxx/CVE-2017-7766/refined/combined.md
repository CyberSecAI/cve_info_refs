| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Attached file
[poc + source.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8841306)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8841306&action=edit)

An unprivileged, standard, Windows user can execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM using the Firefox Updater (via the Maintenance Service).
This is possible by combining two bugs. The first is that the Updater can be tricked into executing an arbitrary PostUpdate file by the updater.ini file after a successful action is performed. The second allows overwrite of any file as SYSTEM with partially attacker controlled data.
We use the overwrite bug to write a new updater.ini, which triggers an install of Firefox into an attacker controlled directory which allows arbitrary code execution via the maintenanceservice\_installer.exe binary.
# Reproduction
I've attached a poc + source, to run it you'll need the full update.mar for the current installed version of Firefox [0] (or higher), as well as a full firefox installer [1]. The poc can be run as follows:
firefox\_poc.exe payload.exe firefox-51.0.1.complete.mar "Firefox Setup 51.0.1.exe" C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox
The payload.exe is the file to be executed as SYSTEM. The final argument needs to be a legitimate Firefox installation directory, and will default to C:\Program Files(x86)\Mozilla Firefox if not supplied. One of the bugs relies on a small race condition, which has always executed in less than a minute for me but let me know if you have any problems. It will continue trying until it succeeds or you use ctrl+c to kill it.
The included payload.exe just runs "whoami > /foo.txt", which should create a foo.txt file in your drive root with the contents "nt authority\system".
# ExeRelPath in updater.ini allows execution of arbitrary Mozilla binaries using absolute paths
The ExeRelPath entry in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\updater.ini file is executed by the updater after a successful action is made. There are allowances made to prevent directory traversal using '..', however if an absolute file path is provided instead of a filename then PathAppendSafe [2] (which uses PathAppendW) will return the absolute file path instead.
Eg. PathAppendW("C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox", "C:\some\mozilla.exe")
=> "C:\some\mozilla.exe"
The updater will happily execute this file, as long as it is signed by Mozilla with a current certificate. We can use then use these binaries in ways never intended to gain arbitrary code execution.
The avenue used in this proof of concept is to use the Firefox setup.exe to install Firefox into an attacker controlled directory [3], which then executes whatever is in the maintenanceservice\_installer.exe file on post-install (in fairness, this would have no practical chance of being intercepted otherwise). I imagine there are similar avenues in other Mozilla signed binaries, however I have not investigated them.
# Arbitrary file overwrite with partial content injection
Soon after the updater starts, updater.cpp [4] calls LogInit, which calls GetTempFileNameW with the attacker-supplied patch directory to get a temp filename for the log file. By providing a file which starts with \\.\, GetTempFileNameW will just copy the input into the output buffer instead of providing a valid temp directory.
Eg. GetTempFileNameW("\\.\c:\target\file.txt", L"log", 0, mTmpFilePath)
=> mTmpFilePath = "\\.\c:\target\file.txt"
Since it is essentially a normal file path, the log file will happily truncate and write to this file.
We can insert up to 260 characters at some point in the file using the fact that the working directory argument gets logged in updater.cpp [5]. The resulting file ends up looking something like the following (ABC's are user supplied):
Performing a replace request
PATCH DIRECTORY \\.\C:\target\file.txt
INSTALLATION DIRECTORY C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox
WORKING DIRECTORY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
The apply-to directory must be the same as or a child of the installation directory! Exiting.
In order to reach the line of code which logs the working directory argument, we need to first avoid a failure of WriteStatusFile [6], otherwise the updater will exit early and we will only truncate the file without our content written. The reason WriteStatusFile fails is that it tries to move a file to <patch-dir>/update.status, which in this case is \\.\c:\target\file.txt\update.status, which is not possible because file.txt is a file.
However, if we create a directory junction in an attacker controlled directory, eg. c:\exploit\junction\ pointing to c:\target\, then we can supply that to the updater instead. Now after the updater has opened a file descriptor to file.txt, we race it to switch the junction out with a directory named file.txt before it has attempted the status file move. If we win the race, the updater creates c:\exploit\junction\file.txt\update.status and execution continues.
# Arbitrary code execution
Because GetPrivateProfileStringW [7] isn't very picky about the formatting of the updater.ini, we can use the arbitrary file overwrite to replace the C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\updater.ini with one which looks like this:
Performing a replace request
PATCH DIRECTORY \\.\C:\temp\ff-exploit\overwrite-target\updater.ini
INSTALLATION DIRECTORY C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox
WORKING DIRECTORY
[PostUpdateWin]
ExeRelPath=C:\temp\ff-exploit\setup-dir\ff\_setup.exe
ExeArg=/INI=C:\temp\ff-exploit\setup-dir\ff\_setup.ini
The apply-to directory must be the same as or a child of the installation directory! Exiting.
The ff\_setup.ini has the InstallDirectoryPath entry set to an attacker controlled directory, eg. c:\temp\ff-exploit\new-firefox\ and the MaintenanceService entry set to true. The attacker just needs to copy their payload.exe into c:\temp\ff-exploit-new-firefox\maintenanceservice\_installer.exe and keep it locked for shared reads (so it can't be overwritten on install, but can be executed).
Then, we trigger some action which will succeed, like staging an upate.mar file
-> which will execute the PostUpdateWin command
-> which will install a new copy of firefox into the attacker controlled c:\temp\ff-exploit\new-firefox\ directory
-> which will then run the maintenanceservice\_install.exe payload as SYSTEM
Let me know if you need any more information. I tested on Windows 8.1 x64, Firefox 51.0.1

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Didn't do a full review yet, but I do agree with the approach of just locking down \_all\_ the paths like this.
I'm a little worried about IsValidFullPath rejecting UNC paths; running off of a network share seems like a case we want to support (without requiring a drive mapping).
Also, this might be one of the things you're planning to add, but it's probably also a good idea to check the return code from GetTempFileName. Looks like it would have been returning 0 and setting last-error to 267 (directory name is invalid) while running this exploit.

No, you're right, I was misinterpreting that code somehow. Please disregard.
But that did lead me to discover another issue with using PathIsUNCServerShare this way; it only returns true if the path is just to a share, and false for a directory within a share:
PathIsUNCServerShareW(L"\\\\server\\share") == TRUE
PathIsUNCServerShareW(L"\\\\server\\share\\dir") == FALSE
So that's not all that useful in this context.Flags: needinfo?(mhowell)

Thanks for checking that call and this latest patch should cover it. Still have a few more calls I need to verify but that was the main one. I added a test for the failure case. I'm not sure if it would be ok to add an in tree test using a valid UNC server share path since tests that access the network aren't allowed. Perhaps it would be ok if I used a server name that wouldn't be used since from what I recall the concern is that tests should pass without access to the network resource which this test would.
Added the GetTempFileName checks for the cases that are of concern. I still need to double check if there are other cases.
The main last thing I want to add is checking that the registry entry for the install directory exists from the maintenance service but there might be a few more as I examine the code.
Thanks for the feedback!

Drivers, keeping the existing tests running while adding the new restrictions is taking a little longer than I had thought it would. Another day or so and it should be ready to land on nightly.

patch rev1
I've run other versions of this patch through the try server so I am fairly certain it will pass so requesting review.

I filed [bug 1353889](/show_bug.cgi?id=1353889 "RESOLVED FIXED - Grant write access to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla for the account running tests on Windows test systems") which should make it possible to add tests for the one change that I didn't add a test for. I manually verified that change worked as expected. There are some other things that can be done to simplify the tests overall after the changes to TestAUSHelper but I don't want to do that in this bug.

Still need to fix this call; PathIsUNCServerShare rejects anything not of the precise form "\\server\share" (including "\\server\share\" it turns out), but we need to allow subdirectories of a share.

This may not quite work; GetTempFileName returns 0 and sets the last error to 267 ("The directory name is invalid") when the first argument is a path that doesn't exist, even if it's a valid path. Might have to move the ensure\_parent\_dir call up here, or just check for that case.

Disregard this comment; I didn't notice we were calling PathIsUNCServerShare on the result of PathStripToRoot.

This isn't needed since the file is written to the patch directory which must exist.

patch rev2
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The steps to reproduce this are fairly complicated (see [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM using Updater to overwrite updater.ini")) so in my opinion it wouldn't be that easy,
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think it paints a bulls-eye on the security problem though the checks do give a starting point on what to go after.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
It should be fairly simple and no more risky than this patch.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
As with all significant app update patches I definitely want this to bake on Nightly for a couple of days. Also, if it is ok with you I'd like to land this on the oak branch and test it before landing it on Nightly.

Al, are you ok with my landing this on oak so I can test it there first and if so do you have a date constraint for my landing it. I won't reference this bug or give any details in the message used to land it there?

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
Original maintenance service implementation
[User impact if declined]:
They will continue to be vulnerable to this local exploit
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
I have verified it on Nightly
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
No
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
N/A
[Is the change risky?]:
No more so than any other similar change to app update.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
It validates the command line arguments used with the updater are what should be sent by Firefox. It is possible though not likely that some system might somehow munge the arguments.
[String changes made/needed]:
None

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8753042&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2486.0 Safari/537.36 Edge/13.10586
Steps to reproduce:
Dan from Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR) here. We’ve found a way to bypass Mark of the Web in FireFox. I have a repro available at the following URL: <http://payloadhoster.cloudapp.net/85231FFExploit.htm>
(the same file is attached, but would need to be hosted somewhere along with a file to download in order to repro the issue)
To reproduce the issue:
1. On a Windows 10 machine with Office installed, browse to the page in Firefox
2. Click the link
3. Select either to save the file locally, or open in PowerPoint
This vulnerability appears to be caused by links with a “download” attribute that causes the filename to be longer than what’s allowed in Windows. It’s likely that the cause here is trying to call one Windows API or another with a string that’s too long.
Thank you for reviewing this report and we'll pass on any questions from the engineering team to the finder promptly. We look forward to hearing your team's analysis. For our prompt attention, please email msvr@microsoft.com and reference MSVR 1533 in the title.
Actual results:
mark of the web is not applied in either case
Expected results:
mark of the web is applied and the file is open in protected view

AIUI this is because of:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/jsdownloads/src/DownloadIntegration.jsm#632>
which is going to have the file name suggested by the download attribute.
Now... we could change the filename to not be so long, but AIUI the filename needs to match that of the file we're saving, otherwise it still won't be marked as "from the web". I don't know where we modify the actual filename - presumably, we need to ensure that we save the file somewhere where it doesn't actually get the super-long filename, and we have 'space' left at the end to tag on the ":Zone.Identifier" stuff.
Paolo originally wrote this code ([bug 909022](/show_bug.cgi?id=909022 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mark all executables as coming from the Internet zone on Windows")), and generally knows our download code, so I think it'd be best if he took this.Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

We rely indirectly on the nsIFile.createUnique function to shorten the path at the time it is chosen, it can be tricky to make room for the ":Zone.Identifier" part there:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/DownloadPaths.jsm#55>
We could try prepending "\\?\" during our "OS.File" call in Downloads.jsm to increase the 260 characters limit for that particular operation, I'm not sure if that works with the Alternate Data Stream syntax though. We may have to be careful about features we lose like the automatic conversion of forward slash to backslash.Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

I experimented with the prefix on my Windows 7 system on an NTFS partition:
let streamPath = "\\\\.\\" + aDownload.target.path + ":Zone.Identifier";
This still result in Windows error 3 (The system cannot find the path specified), presumably returned when CreateFileW is called by OS.File. I also tried this without the ADS syntax, just in case:
let streamPath = "\\\\.\\" + aDownload.target.path + "\_Zone.Identifier";
And the result is the same. So, apparently the prefix that according to the documentation should increase the limit accepted by the API to 32767 characters doesn't work here.

CreateUnique makes an assumption that 255 excluding the NUL terminator works for all platforms:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/io/nsLocalFileCommon.cpp#53>
For the rest, we don't have to check for MAX\_PATH explicitly because the OS will raise an error for us if needed. The issue we have only arises when we append the ADS syntax to the file name.

Is anything going to be terribly upset if we just #ifdef XP\_WIN that limit to whatever MAX\_PATH is on Windows minus the length of the ADS syntax ? Or is that a dumb idea for other reasons? :-)

It's kind of linked to the specific ADS name we are using, ":Zone.Identifier", so not terribly great but it's a quick and dirty solution that could work as I think it's the only ADS we'll ever use (hehe, I mean, the only ADS we're currently using).
We may introduce regressions as we may prevent downloads to be saved at all in deeply nested folders where it would be otherwise legitimate to have a short file name, but it may be a cost we need to pay if the Windows API doesn't give us a better solution anyways...

Thanks for asking, I have a technical question for you from [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1273265#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox Mark of the Web bypass (MSVR 1533)"). We might be dealing with a limitation of the Windows API or NTFS with regard to file name length in the presence of an ADS. It's possible this is something that should be fixed on the Microsoft side, even though we might have a workaround.
I experimented with the prefix on my Windows 7 system on an NTFS partition:
let streamPath = "\\\\.\\" + aDownload.target.path + ":Zone.Identifier";
This still result in Windows error 3 (The system cannot find the path specified), presumably returned when CreateFileW is called by OS.File. I also tried this without the ADS syntax, just in case:
let streamPath = "\\\\.\\" + aDownload.target.path + "\_Zone.Identifier";
And the result is the same. So, apparently the prefix that according to the documentation should increase the limit accepted by the API to 32767 characters doesn't work here.
What are the correct Windows API calls to apply an ADS to a file with a long name using the Windows API?

It would be nice if Microsoft, Google, and partners took a look at the questions I raised in this bug.
The bug or limitation might be in the Windows API and affect other products as well.

They've gotten back to me to say that the syntax you're looking for might be \\?\ rather than \\.\
Also, I'm not currently receiving email sent to me through Bugzilla, due to issues with S/MIME on my end. I'm not sure if that matters, but I'm working on getting is solved.

Ah, sorry! So, just prepending \\?\ works fine and it fixes the bug when saving to a local file system. If I understand correctly, however, it won't give the correct result for UNC paths, and won't normalize slashes into backslashes.
So here is a new question for the API owners: do I really have to pass the path to the undocumented RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName\_U function to work around the MAX\_PATH limit and still preprocess the path, as described in the following blog post I just found?
<https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.it/2016/02/the-definitive-guide-on-win32-to-nt.html>
If the conversion rules are very simple we might just reimplement them in JavaScript without the complications of accessing an ntdll export.
Note that we want to keep compatibility back to Windows 7 at least.

Based on discussion with API owners: You can get the canonicalized path name by prepending \\?\ and then calling GetFullPathName on the full string. There should be no need to call RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName\_U. The resulting path should be passable to any Win32 API for saving files and not subject to MAX\_PATH limits.
This will probably end up giving the user a file they can't open due to its filename being too long.
Filename segments are still limited to 255 characters, so you'll still need to truncate in some way. My impression is that you have some other solution to that issue already.
Is that enough information to help you solve this issue?

That works for converting slashes to backslashes, but still doesn't support UNC paths out of the box.
Considering that we are operating under some well known restrictions, and we don't need to provide generic access to paths whose length is beyond MAX\_PATH, I've special cased the UNC "DOS" paths and I believe that it works sufficiently well in combination with GetFullPathName for the problem we're trying to solve here.
The only issue would be if GetFullPathName misses other normalizations that RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName\_U does, beyond handling UNC paths, resulting in an attempt to access a file with a different name in the presence of some special characters, but this is for the API owners to tell. Note that we filter allowed file names, and we've already accessed the file before.

We already operate withing the MAX\_PATH limitations for all other operations, and I've tested the file can still be opened and its properties inspected from Windows Explorer after the ADS is added.
> Is that enough information to help you solve this issue?
I'll post a patch with an implementation that solves the bug for the test case, when saving to local paths or UNC paths. I may need more information on the normalization question above, and the patch can be a good starting point if the API owners want to take a look.

Why do we check for forward slashes here, afaict this isn't allowed for unc paths.

Most Windows APIs actually accept forward slashes and convert them to backslashes automatically, so we need to check for forward slashes as well. Given that this path prefix is set by the Firefox preferences UI, though, it is unlikely that the full path checked here would have forward slashes, unless about:config has been edited directly by an advanced user.
I think we're now only waiting for Jonathan Birch to relay the patch and [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1273265#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox Mark of the Web bypass (MSVR 1533)") to the Windows API owners to tell if this fix is good enough or it may introduce known regressions on shorter paths.Flags: needinfo?(jobirch)

Sorry for the delay in getting this patch reviewed. There were a few complications on our end.
I've had people knowledgeable about path canonicalization examine the source for this patch, and they say it looks correct. I have not been able to perform any practical testing of the patch itself, as it's not clear that I can actually build Firefox from source.
Is that enough for you to move forward with checking in this fix? You still have the original repro to check your fix against for practical testing.Flags: needinfo?(jobirch)

It will be a while before I can find the time to put together a test case, as I'm traveling right now. It's definitely possible to have one, it would just rely on the same new API when reading the Alternate Data Stream.

This bug is rated sec-moderate, so as far as I understand <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process> you should be able to land the patch without explicit sec-approval once it has review. You'll probably want to ask for approval for branch patches for 53 and 54, and possibly 52-esr. The wikipage suggests NOT landing tests until after we ship the fix.
That said, I would strongly encourage you to write the test ASAP, and run it against beta locally (not on try) after you create a branch patch, to ensure we actually fix the issue and successfully test for it in automation, even if we then don't land it until afterwards.
Does that answer your question?Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

I ran the test locally on Nightly for now, not on a Beta build yet. The affected OS.File code has not been touched very much recently, and I expect the patch to apply cleanly to all branches.
It looks like we might be able to land the patch in the next two days, for Beta 10:

The patch
This bug is sec-moderate because it cannot be used alone to run arbitrary code on the user's computer, but it removes the security warning that the Windows operating system shows before running executables downloaded from the Internet.
While sec-approval is not needed, I'm requesting it so I can get help with the landing process. I'll be around in the next few days, but note that the sheriffs may also be able to land the patch without assistance if needed.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
- Easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
- People familiar with the Windows file system can very easily understand the issue being fixed.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
- All branches
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
- The patch should apply easily to all branches
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
- There is a very slim chance of regressions with file names with special characters, but this is mitigated by the fact that the code has been reviewed by Microsoft experts.

A CVE will be assigned before our release. We don't put the names of people on CVE so CVE assignment is immaterial for credit.
This will be mentioned as fixed in the advisory for the appropriate release. The advisory will list the reporter credit as "Jonathan Birch and Microsoft Vulnerability Research" within it.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A mechanism where when a new tab is loaded through JavaScript events, if fullscreen mode is then entered, the addressbar will not be rendered. This would allow a malicious site to displayed a spoofed addressbar, showing the location of an arbitrary website instead of the one loaded.

#### [#CVE-2017-5471: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 54](#CVE-2017-5471)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Byron Campen, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Benjamin Bouvier, Bob Clary, Jon Coppeard, and Michael Layzell reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
