The content is related to CVE-2017-7932.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation in NXP i.MX product family.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** When the device is configured in security-enabled mode, it's possible to bypass signature verification by using a specially crafted certificate, leading to the execution of an unsigned image. This bypass occurs during the secure boot process.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can load an unauthorized image onto the device, potentially leading to a denial of service or complete control over the device by executing arbitrary code. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for bypassing the signature verification of the boot image, which can lead to a variety of malicious outcomes.

**Attack vectors:** Physical access to the device is required, specifically to the USB OTG or UART ports used by the Serial Download Protocol (SDP).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Physical access to the device.
  - Moderate skill level.
  - Ability to create a specially crafted certificate to bypass validation during the boot process.
