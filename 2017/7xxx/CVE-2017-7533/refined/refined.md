  "CVE-2017-7533": {
    "description": "A race condition was found in the Linux kernel, present since v3.14-rc1 through v4.12. The race happens between threads of inotify_handle_event() and vfs_rename() while running the rename operation against the same file. As a result of the race the next slab data or the slab's free list pointer can be corrupted with attacker-controlled data.",
    "vulnerability": "Race condition between inotify_handle_event() and vfs_rename() leads to memory corruption.",
    "impact": "Corruption of slab data or freelist pointer, potentially leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution. A denial of service could also occur.",
    "attack_vector": "Local attacker with the ability to perform file rename operations and trigger inotify events.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to trigger file rename operations and inotify events on the same file concurrently.",
      "affected_components": [
        "kernel",
        "kernel-rt",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux",
