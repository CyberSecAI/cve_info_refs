Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7862:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A logic error in the `pictordec.c` file within the Libav library. Specifically, the condition `if (s->width != avctx->width && s->height != avctx->height)` was incorrect. It should have been `if (s->width != avctx->width || s->height != avctx->height)`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect conditional statement in the picture decoder.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The incorrect condition could lead to undefined behavior and potentially a denial of service, as indicated in the Gentoo advisory (GLSA 201811-19) where a crafted Smacker stream could cause a Denial of Service.
- The Debian security advisory (DSA 4012-1) also mentions "several security issues" corrected in multiple demuxers and decoders which includes this CVE.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability via a crafted media stream, specifically a Smacker stream as mentioned in the Gentoo advisory.
- The specific file affected was the `pictordec.c`, indicating an issue with the picture decoding functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted media file to the vulnerable application using the Libav library. This could be via a network connection or through a local file.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves changing the logical AND (`&&`) to a logical OR (`||`) in the conditional statement within the `pictordec.c` file.
- This issue was discovered through a continuous fuzzing process by Google's oss-fuzz project.
- The fix is included in Libav version 12.3 and later.
- This CVE is associated with other vulnerabilities in libav, as evidenced in the Debian Security Advisory.
