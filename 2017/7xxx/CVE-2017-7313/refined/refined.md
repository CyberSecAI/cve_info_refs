Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A hidden page within the Personify360 platform, accessible via the URL `/TabId/275`, was discovered. This page did not require any authentication to access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authentication requirements for the `/TabId/275` page. This allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive functionalities.
*   **Customer Data Exposure:** The page has a "Customer Management" section that allows searching customer data, returning up to 100 results at a time.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed for the enumeration of customer IDs and querying of the SSO database to obtain their emails (usernames).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Customer Data Breach:** An attacker can dump customer data (customer IDs and associated email addresses/usernames) from the Personify database. This information can be used to gain access to user accounts.
*   **Potential for Automated Attacks:** Because the page did not require authentication, it was possible to write a script to automate the process of searching and dumping user data through the available search functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** An attacker directly accesses the vulnerable page `/TabId/275` without needing authentication.
*   **Automated Scripting:** An attacker can create a script to systematically search and extract data using the search function on the vulnerable page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Personify360 system to reach the vulnerable URL `/TabId/275`.
*   **Basic Scripting Knowledge (Optional):** While manual exploitation is possible, scripting knowledge to automate data extraction makes the attack faster and more efficient.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerable page also allows access to API vendor credentials which is covered by CVE-2017-7312
* The vulnerable page also allows mapping of the database schema which is covered by CVE-2017-7314
