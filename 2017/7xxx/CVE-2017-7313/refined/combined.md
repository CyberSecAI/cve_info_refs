# CVE-2017-7314 – Dump Personify Database Schema (3/3)

[June 6, 2017](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7314-dump-personify-database-schema-33/) ~ [Assistant](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/author/souldoctorsassistant/)

In the [previous post](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7313-how-to-dump-personify-customer-data-with-one-click-23/) we showed how we can dump user data from the Personify Database.

In this post we are going to discuss how this page allows us to also map out all the other tables and columns in the database.

**Quick Recap**

When going to <http://www.site.com/TabId/275> we see the following page

![tab-275](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tab-275.png?w=656)

On the left hand side we will click ‘Role Configuration’ which should bring us to a page like this

![schema-leak 2](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/schema-leak-2.png?w=656)

As you can see there is a ‘Role Based on Table’ dropdown, once clicked we can see all the tables in the system. Once a table is selected, we can click on the ‘Customer ID Column’ to see all the columns in the selected table.

To fix follow the instructions in their email

# [CVE-2017-7313 – How to dump Personify Customer Data with one click (2/3)](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7313-how-to-dump-personify-customer-data-with-one-click-23/)

[June 6, 2017June 6, 2017](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7313-how-to-dump-personify-customer-data-with-one-click-23/) ~ [Assistant](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/author/souldoctorsassistant/)  ~ [Leave a comment](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7313-how-to-dump-personify-customer-data-with-one-click-23/#respond)

**Background**

When Pentesting Personify360 a hidden page was found that did not require authentication. The specific URL was:

<http://www.site.com/TabId/275>

In my [previous post](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/) we discussed how we can leverage it to create or edit an existing API account.

In this post we will further explore the functionality available on this page.

**Dumping Customer Data**

When looking at the left side of the screenshot there are some more options

![tab-275](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tab-275.png?w=656)

If we click on Customer Management we can see the following screen

![customer-harvesting](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-harvesting.png?w=656)

As you can see there is a place to search for customer’s in the Personify database and return the top one hundred results. Yes, it can be time consuming, but because no login is required you can write a quick python script that can go through all the combinations fairly quickly.

Once we have their customer ID’s we query the SSO database for their email, which essentially gives us their username to the system.

To fix follow the instructions in their email

CVE-2017-7313

# [CVE-2017-7312 – How to get Personify API Access with one click](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/)

[June 6, 2017June 6, 2017](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/) ~ [Assistant](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/author/souldoctorsassistant/)  ~ [1 Comment](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/#comments)

Recently, I was doing some pen-testing on a higher end Association Management System (AMS) called Personify. Specifically, the Personify360 7.5 platform. Some significant bugs were discovered and in the next few posts I’ll describe what they are and how they were found.

**Background**

Personify is a system that helps associations manage their membership fees as well as sell products via a built-in e-Conmerce platform.

**The Bug**

When on a Personify site navigate to the /TabId/275 URI, it should look something like this:

<http://www.site.com/TabId/275>

When you go there a screen similar to this will appear

![tab-275](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tab-275.png?w=656)

This is actually showing a list of ‘vendors’ (read: programs with API access with their usernames. The is no login required to see this data.

It gets better, if you click the edit button on any of the rows, here’s what comes up

![view-edit-vendor 2](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/view-edit-vendor-2.png?w=656)

Yup all the account data is available in clear text (cut out for privacy reasons). Username, Password, Block (Personify’s version of password) as well as other information is available to copy or edit, good times.

You can even go back to the previous page (first screenshot) and click the New button if you just want to create an additional account.

Once that’s done you can use SoapUI or a similar tool to connect to their web-services using these credentials and to actions on user accounts or just to steal all the data.

To fix this issue update to the latest version of Personify by following the instructions from their email (see below screenshot)

![personify-email-fix](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personify-email-fix.png?w=656)

# [CVE-2017-7313 – How to dump Personify Customer Data with one click (2/3)](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7313-how-to-dump-personify-customer-data-with-one-click-23/)

[June 6, 2017June 6, 2017](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7313-how-to-dump-personify-customer-data-with-one-click-23/) ~ [Assistant](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/author/souldoctorsassistant/)  ~ [Leave a comment](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7313-how-to-dump-personify-customer-data-with-one-click-23/#respond)

**Background**

When Pentesting Personify360 a hidden page was found that did not require authentication. The specific URL was:

<http://www.site.com/TabId/275>

In my [previous post](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/) we discussed how we can leverage it to create or edit an existing API account.

In this post we will further explore the functionality available on this page.

**Dumping Customer Data**

When looking at the left side of the screenshot there are some more options

![tab-275](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tab-275.png?w=656)

If we click on Customer Management we can see the following screen

![customer-harvesting](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-harvesting.png?w=656)

As you can see there is a place to search for customer’s in the Personify database and return the top one hundred results. Yes, it can be time consuming, but because no login is required you can write a quick python script that can go through all the combinations fairly quickly.

Once we have their customer ID’s we query the SSO database for their email, which essentially gives us their username to the system.

To fix follow the instructions in their email

# [CVE-2017-7312 – How to get Personify API Access with one click](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/)

[June 6, 2017June 6, 2017](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/) ~ [Assistant](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/author/souldoctorsassistant/)  ~ [1 Comment](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/#comments)

Recently, I was doing some pen-testing on a higher end Association Management System (AMS) called Personify. Specifically, the Personify360 7.5 platform. Some significant bugs were discovered and in the next few posts I’ll describe what they are and how they were found.

**Background**

Personify is a system that helps associations manage their membership fees as well as sell products via a built-in e-Conmerce platform.

**The Bug**

When on a Personify site navigate to the /TabId/275 URI, it should look something like this:

<http://www.site.com/TabId/275>

When you go there a screen similar to this will appear

![tab-275](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tab-275.png?w=656)

This is actually showing a list of ‘vendors’ (read: programs with API access with their usernames. The is no login required to see this data.

It gets better, if you click the edit button on any of the rows, here’s what comes up

![view-edit-vendor 2](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/view-edit-vendor-2.png?w=656)

Yup all the account data is available in clear text (cut out for privacy reasons). Username, Password, Block (Personify’s version of password) as well as other information is available to copy or edit, good times.

You can even go back to the previous page (first screenshot) and click the New button if you just want to create an additional account.

Once that’s done you can use SoapUI or a similar tool to connect to their web-services using these credentials and to actions on user accounts or just to steal all the data.

To fix this issue update to the latest version of Personify by following the instructions from their email (see below screenshot)

![personify-email-fix](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personify-email-fix.png?w=656)

In the [previous post](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/cve-2017-7313-how-to-dump-personify-customer-data-with-one-click-23/) we showed how we can dump user data from the Personify Database.

In this post we are going to discuss how this page allows us to also map out all the other tables and columns in the database.

**Quick Recap**

When going to <http://www.site.com/TabId/275> we see the following page

![tab-275](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tab-275.png?w=656)

On the left hand side we will click ‘Role Configuration’ which should bring us to a page like this

![schema-leak 2](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/schema-leak-2.png?w=656)

As you can see there is a ‘Role Based on Table’ dropdown, once clicked we can see all the tables in the system. Once a table is selected, we can click on the ‘Customer ID Column’ to see all the columns in the selected table.

To fix follow the instructions in their email

# [CVE-2017-7312 – How to get Personify API Access with one click](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/)

[June 6, 2017June 6, 2017](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/) ~ [Assistant](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/author/souldoctorsassistant/)  ~ [1 Comment](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/first-blog-post/#comments)

Recently, I was doing some pen-testing on a higher end Association Management System (AMS) called Personify. Specifically, the Personify360 7.5 platform. Some significant bugs were discovered and in the next few posts I’ll describe what they are and how they were found.

**Background**

Personify is a system that helps associations manage their membership fees as well as sell products via a built-in e-Conmerce platform.

**The Bug**

When on a Personify site navigate to the /TabId/275 URI, it should look something like this:

<http://www.site.com/TabId/275>

When you go there a screen similar to this will appear

![tab-275](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tab-275.png?w=656)

This is actually showing a list of ‘vendors’ (read: programs with API access with their usernames. The is no login required to see this data.

It gets better, if you click the edit button on any of the rows, here’s what comes up

![view-edit-vendor 2](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/view-edit-vendor-2.png?w=656)

Yup all the account data is available in clear text (cut out for privacy reasons). Username, Password, Block (Personify’s version of password) as well as other information is available to copy or edit, good times.

You can even go back to the previous page (first screenshot) and click the New button if you just want to create an additional account.

Once that’s done you can use SoapUI or a similar tool to connect to their web-services using these credentials and to actions on user accounts or just to steal all the data.

To fix this issue update to the latest version of Personify by following the instructions from their email (see below screenshot)

![personify-email-fix](https://amswoes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personify-email-fix.png?w=656)
