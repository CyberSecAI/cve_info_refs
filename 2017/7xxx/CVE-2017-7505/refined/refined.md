Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7505:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect authorization check within the Foreman application. Users with user management permissions assigned to specific organizations were able to perform actions on all administrator user objects, including those outside of their assigned organizational scope. This occurred because the system considered administrators to be effectively present in all organizations, leading to their visibility and editability across all contexts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Authorization Check**: The primary weakness is the faulty authorization logic that failed to properly restrict access to administrator user objects based on organizational scopes.
- **Scope Creep:** User management permissions assigned within a specific organization were improperly extended to administrator accounts that were not part of that organization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access and Modification:** A user with user management permissions within an organization could view and modify administrator accounts outside of their organization, including changing their passwords.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with limited permissions could gain control over global administrator accounts, effectively escalating their privileges within the system.
- **Compromise of Administrator Accounts:** Attackers could potentially compromise the entire system by taking control of administrator accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based**: The vulnerability could be exploited remotely via the application's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Existing user account:** Attackers would need a valid user account with user management permissions within at least one organization.
- **Network access:** The attacker would require network access to the Foreman application.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was present since Foreman 1.5, where nested organizations were introduced.
- The fix involved modifying the Taxonomix module to only include admin IDs if User.current.admin? is true, thereby restricting access to administrators based on user permissions and organization scope.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8/10, indicating a High severity level.
