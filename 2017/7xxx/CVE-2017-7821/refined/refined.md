Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of WebExtensions to download and attempt to open certain non-executable file types without requiring explicit user interaction for the file download and open actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insufficient File Type Restrictions:** WebExtensions were able to download and open certain file types that can trigger external applications, even if the files themselves weren't executables. This bypasses expected security checks related to file handling.
-   **Lack of User Interaction Requirement:** The lack of a user interaction requirement for opening downloaded files through WebExtensions.
-   **Bypass of Executable Checks:**  Specifically on Windows, while executable files (.exe) would trigger a prompt from Windows, certain file types like .jar were not treated as executable by the browser's download manager. This resulted in them opening without explicit user interaction through extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution (RCE):** By downloading and automatically opening a malicious file (e.g., a JAR file, which contains executable code), an attacker could achieve remote code execution on a user's system.
-   **Triggering Vulnerabilities in Handling Programs:** The vulnerability could be leveraged to trigger vulnerabilities in programs associated with these file types.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious WebExtension:** An attacker could create or compromise a WebExtension that uses the browser.downloads API to download and open malicious files.
-   **Web-Based Attacks:** A malicious webpage could lure a user into installing a malicious WebExtension, which could then execute the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to Create/Compromise a WebExtension:** An attacker would need the capability to create or take over an existing WebExtension and deploy it through Mozilla's add-on platform or through social engineering.
-   **User Interaction:** Although the vulnerability bypasses some user interaction for downloading and opening, there is some user interaction to install the webextension or navigate to the webpage where the attacker is operating from.
