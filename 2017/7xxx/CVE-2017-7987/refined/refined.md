- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate escaping of file and folder names in the template manager component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  By manipulating file or folder names, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed when the template manager component displays these names.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create/manipulate files or folders that the template manager displays. The level of required access or permissions is not specified in the description, but it would be expected that an attacker would have some level of access to the Joomla backend/filesystem.
