- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The timeline view of the new course overview block could display events for activities in hidden courses that the user shouldn't have access to.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability. The course overview block was not properly checking user permissions before displaying activity events, resulting in exposure of information related to hidden courses.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized viewing of course activities that were intended to be hidden from the user. This could reveal sensitive information about course content and progress, potentially affecting the privacy and security of the learning environment.

- **Attack vectors:** A user with access to the course overview block could potentially view activity events from hidden courses in the timeline. This could be unintentional or intentional by the user.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user needs to be logged in to the Moodle platform and have access to the course overview block, which is a standard feature. No special permissions or roles are required beyond being a valid user on the platform.

- **Additional details:** The issue was present in Moodle version 3.3 and was fixed in version 3.3.1. The tracker issue is MDL-59304.
