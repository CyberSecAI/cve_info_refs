Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Linux sandbox broker in Firefox incorrectly allowed file truncation using the `O_TRUNC` flag, even when the sandbox only had read-only access to the file. This was due to the Linux kernel's behavior of allowing `O_TRUNC` to work with `O_RDONLY`, which was not properly handled by the sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect File Access Control:** The sandbox was intended to prevent modifications to files in read-only mode, but the `O_TRUNC` flag was not properly checked for write access. This allowed a content process, even if compromised, to truncate files that should have been protected.
- **POSIX Undefined Behavior:** The issue existed because POSIX defines the result of using `O_TRUNC` with `O_RDONLY` as undefined. Linux chose to allow the truncate, which was not handled by the sandbox policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** A compromised content process could truncate files, leading to data loss. Although the vulnerability is not a full remote code execution (RCE), it could cause data loss if an attacker gains control of a content process.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not directly leading to RCE, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone for a more sophisticated attack if an attacker chains this vulnerability with other exploits to cause more damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Content Process:** The attack requires a compromised content process on a Linux system.
- **Malicious File Operations:** The attacker would need to use the `open` system call with the `O_RDONLY | O_TRUNC` flags on a file the content process has read-only access to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Execution within Content Process:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a sandboxed content process in Firefox. This could be achieved through other vulnerabilities.
- **Linux Environment:** This vulnerability is specific to Linux systems where content sandboxing is enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- **Severity:**  The vulnerability is rated as "sec-moderate".
- **Affected Platforms:**  The vulnerability specifically affects Linux systems.
- **Mitigation:** The fix was to require `MAY_WRITE` permission when the `O_TRUNC` flag is used, correctly preventing the truncation.
- **Browser Versions:** The fix was included in Firefox 55 and Firefox 56. It was not applied to ESR52 since content process sandboxing was not enabled by default on Linux in that version.

In summary, this vulnerability allowed a compromised content process to truncate files by exploiting Linux behavior of allowing `O_TRUNC` in `O_RDONLY` mode and a missing check in the sandbox implementation.
