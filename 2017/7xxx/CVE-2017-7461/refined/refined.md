Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-7461:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The Intellinet NFC-30IR camera's web interface uses a CGI script (`/cgi-bin/admin/fileread`) to read local files.
- Instead of processing the files server-side, it directly returns the plain text content of requested files.
- The script lacks input sanitization or restrictions on accessible file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `fileread` script allows an authenticated user to read any file on the device's filesystem, due to the lack of path sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Sensitive file access:** An attacker can read any file on the device, potentially exposing:
    - System configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/boa.conf`).
    - Credentials, settings, and other sensitive information stored on the device.
    - Other files that might be useful for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP request:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `fileread` endpoint, specifying the file path to read via the `READ.filePath` parameter.
    - Example: `/cgi-bin/admin/fileread?READ.filePath=/etc/passwd`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the web interface as an administrator (`admin:admin`).
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web server.
