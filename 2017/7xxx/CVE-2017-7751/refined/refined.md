The fix is to prevent script execution during the destruction of a document viewer by adding an `nsAutoScriptBlocker`. The root cause is in the destruction of the document viewer (PresShell/PresContext/ViewManager) during the nsDocumentViewer::Hide call. The exception thrown during the teardown of the video control also causes a second flush where a new view manager is created before the old one is fully released. The HTML track element is involved because the crash happens when the video control of the iframe is removed. The fix was to put the operations of destroying the PresShell under the protection of a nsAutoScriptBlocker. "
