## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 57

Announced
November 14, 2017
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 57

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

##### References

* [Bug 1406750](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406750)
* [Bug 1412252](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412252)

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

##### References

* [Bug 1408990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990)

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

##### References

* [Bug 1392026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026)

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1370497](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497)

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

##### References

* [Bug 1402363](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363)

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1401339](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339)

#### [#CVE-2017-7837: SVG loaded as <img> can use meta tags to set cookies](#CVE-2017-7837)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

SVG loaded through `<img>` tags can use `<meta>` tags within the SVG data to set cookies for that page.

##### References

* [Bug 1325923](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923)

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

##### References

* [Bug 1399540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540)

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

##### References

* [Bug 1402896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896)

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

##### References

* [Bug 1366420](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366420)

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.

##### References

* [Bug 1397064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064)

#### [#CVE-2017-7827: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 57](#CVE-2017-7827)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0
Build ID: 20170824053838
Steps to reproduce:
1. Created the attached PoC HTML page, which contains a hyperlink to a fake A-label subdomain (xn--accountlogin) of a valid IDN (xn--google.com).
2. Opened the attached PoC HTML page in the latest released version of Firefox (55.0.3)
3. Hovered over the hyperlink
4. Observed the display of the hyperlink URL
Actual results:
The displayed URL was "xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com".
Expected results:
The displayed URL should be "xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com".
An issue that makes this slightly more serious is that some URL scanning and phishing services will fail to detect the URL, since they assume the browser will display “xn--google.com” in its UNICODE format, and not its Punycode format, and that the URL is therefore not deceptive. They do this to avoid false positives for Punycode domains that happen by chance to have a deceptive substring, but are not themselves deceptive. The ability to force Firefox to display bare Punycode makes such URLs dangerous again.
The attached Proof of Concept demonstrates that an attacker could register a Punycode spoof domain (such as xn--google.com) and then specify a Fake A-label subdomain so that the Punycode spoof domain name is displayed in its Punycode representation. In this proof of concept, we demonstrate that a Fake A-label subdomain of "xn--accountlogin" incorrectly causes the parent label "xn--google" to be rendered as Punycode. We expect the correct behavior to be that the rendering of parent name labels to be independent of child label values. In other words, we believe the correct rendering of this domain name to be "xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com", not "xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com". It should be noted that the latest released version of Chrome and Safari consistently display this domain name as "䕮䕵䕶䕱.com" regardless of child label values.

|  | |

The spoofiness of xn--google.com is noted in the Unicode specs: <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/#Punycode_Spoofs>
By itself, or paired with an ascii subdomain, it's handled correctly. Why is adding a xn--accountlogin label breaking things?
The hover text can be spoofed programmatically anyway so I'm less concerned about that than the domain display when you finally do navigate. If we fix that it will fix the hover text.Component: Untriaged → Address Bar

|  | |

Although xn--google.com happens to be a valid IDN, some spoofy xn-- names might not be and then they'd stay punycode per spec.Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Curious.
It looks to me like this is a bug in nsIDNService::ACEtoUTF8. Note the comment at [1] which refers to RFC 3490 (now superseded, but that's beside the point here). This says that "If any step fails, then the original input sequence is returned...", and sure enough, we do that in the loop at [2] (and again for the last fragment at [3]).
Trouble is, the text in RFC 3490 that was referred to here[4] is talking about a \*single\* label ("a sequence of Unicode code points that make up one label"), not the entire IDN that may be made up of a sequence of labels. But we call ACEtoUTF8 on the complete domain name (e.g. "www.xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com") that we're intending to display, and it handles looping over the string and converting each dot-delimited substring.
So the bug is that when we encounter a decoding failure on \*any\* of the individual labels in the string ACEtoUTF8 is processing, we immediately return the complete unchanged input for the \*whole\* IDN. What we should be doing, I think, is considering such failures independently for each label: if decodeACE fails for an individual label, then that individual label (only) should be left in its original form, but the remaining labels may still be separately decoded.
I'll attach a patch that fixes this, though we'll need to check what else it might impact...

The patch above fixes the domain display when you navigate to the example site; however, it does \*not\* seem to affect the hover text. I'm not sure offhand what that depends on...

Actually, we don't seem to decode the punycode labels for the hover text even if they're all valid: "<http://www.xn--google.com/>" displays as such in the hover text, even though it becomes <http://www.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com/> in the URL bar.

Failure to decode an individual label within the IDN should not block decoding of other valid punycode labels
AFAICS, this has been handled incorrectly for the case of processing an entire domain (rather than just a single label) ever since the ACEtoUTF8 method was first introduced, back in [bug 196717](/show_bug.cgi?id=196717 "RESOLVED FIXED - Decode ACE to UTF-8").
We don't appear to have any tests that are affected by this, so I'll look into adding some coverage.

[Comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox IDN display vulnerability") seems like the right analysis to me. This is a different class of problem to the other "spoofing" issues we've encountered recently; this is simply a bug.

Looks like there's an additional, related problem that we should also fix: calling nsIDNService::ConvertToDisplayIDN with something like "xn--google.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com" (with the default profile) returns, as expected, "䕮䕵䕶䕱.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com".
But calling it with "xn--x.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com" (where "xn--x" is not a valid punycode label) returns the mangled result "xn--xn--x-pm43a.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com".
Simple testcase:
data:text/html;charset=utf-8,<a href="<http://xn--x.%E4%95%AE%E4%95%B5%E4%95%B6%E4%95%B1.com>">test</a>
Here, the hover text appears as "xn--xn--x-pm43a.xn--google.com", with incorrect subdomain; and after navigating, the URL bar shows the destination as "xn--xn--x-pm43a.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com".
So an additional patch will be needed, I think.

Attached patch

[patch 2 - Handle invalid punycode better in stringPrep to avoid mangling display of fake-punycode labels](attachment.cgi?id=8908594&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8908594&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1399540&attachment=8908594)

The issue in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox IDN display vulnerability") arises during stringPrep calls made by nsIDNService::Normalize, because ICU's uidna\_labelToUnicode will append U+FFFD to a label that contains invalid punycode, which confuses our subsequent processing. It also returns an error flag, but we're currently ignoring that. :( By detecting this error and stripping the extra REPLACEMENT CHARACTER from such a label, we can fix the garbled result we're getting for such labels.

This adds a few IDN tests that relate to the two bugs being fixed here. (It was when trying to create such tests for the first patch that I noticed the broken processing of invalid labels described in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox IDN display vulnerability"), and fixed by the second patch.) Both the above patches are needed in order for these to pass successfully.

This does make sense, and it's certainly a step in the right direction.
But other browsers fail URL parsing when failing to decode ACE labels. I'm wondering if we should do the same.

In what sense do they fail? AFAICT, with the PoC here Chrome accepts the "xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com" address and tries to navigate there, ending up at a domain-parking page for "www.xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com"; this is the same behavior we get once the patches here are applied.

I was trying out one of your tests in Chrome:
var url = new URL("<http://xn--accountlogin.xn--google>"); url.href
> "<http://xn--accountlogin.xn--google/>"
var url = new URL("<http://xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com>");
> VM146:1 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL
> at <anonymous>:1:11
> (anonymous) @ VM146:1
Edge had a similar behaviour. I guess we should leave that for a follow up.

Interesting... so Chrome's URL parsing rejects the mixed form "<http://xn--accountlogin.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com>" but accepts "<http://xn--accountlogin.xn--google.com>", although AFAICT the two should be equivalent. IMO it would make more sense that either -both- of these should be rejected on the basis that they include an invalid-ACE label, or neither should be rejected (at the parsing level, although the invalid label will never be successfully resolved). But further study of the relevant specs may be needed to see whether there's any clear statement on this.
So yes, sounds like something to consider for a followup.

To follow up on this, I tried reading the URL parsing algorithm[1] and AFAICT, it looks like Chrome is in error here (which is comforting, given its apparent inconsistency).
The algorithm depends on a "host parser"[2] which in turn uses a "domain to ASCII"[3] algorithm based on Unicode's ToASCII[4]. This basically splits the domain on dots, and then punycode-encodes any labels that contain non-ASCII characters; but I don't see anything that requires an invalid-ACE label like "xn--accountlogin" to result in a validation failure, nor any justification for treating this differently depending on whether a separate label within the domain contained non-ASCII chars (and therefore was punycode-encoded by ToASCII).
It's entirely possible, of course, that I've overlooked something; there are a lot of scattered pieces of spec involved here!

And FWIW, Safari agrees with us here, that the two cases "xn--x.xn--google" and "xn--x.䕮䕵䕶䕱" are treated identically:
> new URL("<http://xn--x.xn--google.com>")
< URL {href: "<http://xn--x.xn--google.com/>", origin: "<http://xn--x.xn--google.com>", protocol: "http:", username: "", password: "", …}
> new URL("<http://xn--x.䕮䕵䕶䕱.com>")
< URL {href: "<http://xn--x.xn--google.com/>", origin: "<http://xn--x.xn--google.com>", protocol: "http:", username: "", password: "", …}
Whereas Chrome, as you note, rejects the latter version with a TypeError.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to <https://jsfiddle.net/26nLj6mL/1/>
2. Now go to <https://shhnjk.com/>
Actual results:
<https://shhnjk.com/> is not accessible and says "Bad request" due to Cookie bomb. Same attack can be done from <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/svg_data.html>.
Expected results:
Cookie should not be set by SVG image. Fix of <https://insert-script.blogspot.ae/2016/12/firefox-svg-cross-domain-cookie.html> only prevented setting cross domain cookie. But if site hosted svg image who has content disposition: attachment specified would be affected too. Same for the site who allows data URI in img tag.

Dan or Dragana, do you know why we allow setting cookies from <meta> tags from inside SVG images, esp. when they are used inside <img> tags? That seems surprising to me...
The jsfiddle loads: <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/test.svg>

In [bug 1317641 comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1317641#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - http redirect to data: inherits principal (SVG image cookie setting; object XSS)"), bz seemed to say that the spec technically requires this behavior. Though as I suggested in [bug 1317641 comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1317641#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - http redirect to data: inherits principal (SVG image cookie setting; object XSS)"), we could add a "no images" check in nsContentSink::ProcessHeaderData to prevent this.
I think that might be a good idea, from the perspective of images being atomic black-boxes & having no external side-effects / no scripting / etc. bz, what do you think?Flags: needinfo?(dholbert) → needinfo?(bzbarsky)

I think we should talk to the spec editor about how to get the spec fixed. For example, the way the spec is written right now, a set-cookie <meta> in an XHR response document should also set cookies, which seems obviously undesirable. And yet I expect Gecko does just that right now...Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Unfortunately I don't know a fast answer :-( Probably the right path forward is to do what bz suggests in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie").Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Hi,
Any update on severity or status of this issue? Will it take quite some time to fix it?

A direct fix would be trivial -- just a one-line change. We could just add a "mDocument->IsBeingUsedAsImage()" check to this nsGkAtoms::setcookie comparison, in nsContentSink::ProcessHeaderData():
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b3774461acc6bee2216c5f57e167f9e5795fb09d/dom/base/nsContentSink.cpp#307>
(An automated testcase would be a little more difficult to write, but not too bad.)
But per [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie"), we should first probably figure out more generally which sorts resources should & shouldn't be allowed to use the <meta> tag to set cookies, and get that settled in the spec... Jason, is there anyone who's worked on networking/cookie code who we could task with that?Flags: needinfo?(jduell.mcbugs)

Hmm, my reading of the spec is a bit different than Boris'.
<<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-meta-http-equiv-set-cookie>> step 2 takes us to <<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.3>>, where per step 1 we can ignore the cookie.
So technically we could change our behavior here freely, but I agree that it seems more useful to spec something.
Chromium currently only honors the mata element for HTML documents with a TODO comment about enabling it for XML documents in general: <<https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/loader/HttpEquiv.cpp?sq=package:chromium&rcl=1484828258&l=116>>. I think honoring this only for HTML documents makes sense. What do you think, Boris?
We also have two extra bugs in the meta processing:
1. We ignore whether the document has access to cookies at all, which is the reason that Gecko currently will honor such meta elements for XHR parsed documents. (As far as I can tell, this behavior isn't even spec'ed.)
2. We ignore whether the document is in a sandboxed iframe that doesn't have the allow-same-origin bit set.Flags: needinfo?(ehsan)

To answer the question of what I think our behavior should be, I think we should only honor the meta tag if |doc->IsHTMLorXHTML() && !doc->GetDisplayDocument()|. We should also only honor such meta tags if they appear within the head element, per spec.

> where per step 1 we can ignore the cookie.
Well... sort of, in the sense that not setting cookies ever is technically spec-compliant.
But in practice, the HTML spec should spell out cases in which \_setting\_ a cookie would be a spec violation. And this should probably be one of those cases.
> What do you think, Boris?
Then text/html XHR results will set cookies, right? And HTML imports? And so forth...
Imo we should restrict this to "non-data" documents.

OK, fair. That's still not a duplicate of [bug 1317641](/show_bug.cgi?id=1317641 "RESOLVED FIXED - http redirect to data: inherits principal (SVG image cookie setting; object XSS)"), because <img> tag with data: URI is in fact expected to be treated as same-origin.

I cannot reproduce this issue using jsfiddle.net: when the svg image is loaded from <https://jsfiddle.net/26nLj6mL/1/>, the cookies are not set and not sent to <https://shhnjk.com/> when that URI is loaded.
But I can reproduce it when loading the data: URL approach. Here a fix.

Why not? What prevents it?
Disabling all <meta> for data: is clearly wrong.
The patch says it implements [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie") and 11, but what it does looks nothing like those comments.

I am still able to reproduce in Nightly Fx55.0a1. By visiting site #1, opening Preferences and viewing cookie store. I can see the cookies for site #2's domain.
However, the behavior of error message "Bad request" is something that I cannot reproduce. Site #2 loads just fine.

Anne, please see [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie") and 11.

I think we should be using <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#cookie-averse-document-object> instead. That's what document.cookie uses and seems more appropriate.

According to the spec, we should check for cookie averseness before getting or setting cookies. The spec isn't clear about precedence wrt the CSP check but there's a WPT that fails if we check for document averseness before the CSP check (and therefore don't throw).

Add a mochitest.
I have to admit that I cribbed a bunch of this from the original jsfiddle. This test would be in the public domain once it lands. Jun, are you OK with that?

Use this API where we're supposed to
This patch is orthogonal to this bug, but it brings us more in line with the spec. I would also like to file a followup bug on possibly combining this with nsHTMLDocument::mDisableCookieAccess.

This will disable document.cookie on file:// URIs. It's worth making sure that what we are doing here is compatible with what WebKit, Blink and EdgeHTML are shipping. r=me assuming that is the case but please double check that. If that is not the case, please let me know, depending on what the reality is we may need to consider updating the spec or do something else...

Hmm, IMO it's a bug in the spec that it doesn't clarify the order of processing here! Please file a spec issue and note a link to it in the commit message or something? It'd be nice if you mentioned the wpt test that depends on the processing order there as well! Thank you.

(In reply to :Ehsan Akhgari (needinfo please, extremely long backlog, Away 8/23) from [comment #52](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c52 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie"))

Ehsan was spot-on here. I tested and found that Safari, Edge, and Firefox (before this patch) all allow cookies on file URIs. Chromium is the odd browser out that does not. This seems like a spec bug that we should raise against the definition of "cookie-averse documents" -- Anne, that does leave us with a decision about what we should do in the meantime. Firefox has explicit code to allow file: URIs (which don't have hosts/base domains) to set cookies but doesn't allow other types of host-less URIs to set them.
So, I can either explicitly allow file: URIs to the list at [1] (keep the explicit whitelist in the spec and extending it) or, instead, check either that the document's codebase URI either is a file URI or has a base domain. In the "old world" of Gecko, where addons could add protocols and URI implementations, I'd probably prefer the latter solution, but now that we're in the new webextensions world, maybe we can hold a firmer line and have a whitelist?
Anne, what do you think?

Instead of hardcoding this, you should include /common/get-host-info.sub.js and use the 'OTHER\_HOST' key. See <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/web-platform/tests/common/get-host-info.sub.js>.

I'd just add "file" to the safelist. file: URLs are typically not considered (as they're not cross-platform other than parsing and not really the web) and I'm not sure "file" should be added to the definition of "network scheme" as that would also affect other things, but I suppose that in the definition of cookie-averse we could mention it somehow. Hope that helps.Flags: needinfo?(annevk)

I think that given the risk that cookies bring, we should hold off on backporting this to branches. It's been labeled as sec-moderate, so I don't think we have to rush and take on the extra risk that incurs.Flags: needinfo?(mrbkap)
