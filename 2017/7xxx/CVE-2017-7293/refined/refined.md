{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DAX2API service, a DCOM service written in .NET, is running with system privileges. The use of .NET for DCOM is inherently unsafe.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper use of .NET for DCOM",
    "DCOM service running with system privileges"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A normal user can escalate privileges to arbitrary system privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation using DCOM.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A normal user with local access to the system."
