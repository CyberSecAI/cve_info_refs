Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

##### References

* [Bug 1371889](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1371889)

#### [#CVE-2017-7817: Firefox for Android address bar spoofing through fullscreen mode](#CVE-2017-7817)

Reporter
Raphael Saniyazov
Impact
high
##### Description

A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a page switches to fullscreen mode without user notification, allowing a fake address bar to be displayed. This allows an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use.
*Note: This attack only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1356596](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1356596)

#### [#CVE-2017-7818: Use-after-free during ARIA array manipulation](#CVE-2017-7818)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating arrays of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) elements within containers through the DOM. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1363723](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1363723)

#### [#CVE-2017-7819: Use-after-free while resizing images in design mode](#CVE-2017-7819)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in design mode when image objects are resized if objects referenced during the resizing have been freed from memory. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1380292](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380292)

#### [#CVE-2017-7824: Buffer overflow when drawing and validating elements with ANGLE](#CVE-2017-7824)

Reporter
Omair, Andre Weissflog
Impact
high
##### Description

A buffer overflow occurs when drawing and validating elements with the ANGLE graphics library, used for WebGL content. This is due to an incorrect value being passed within the library during checks and results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1398381](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1398381)

#### [#CVE-2017-7805: Use-after-free in TLS 1.2 generating handshake hashes](#CVE-2017-7805)

Reporter
Martin Thomson
Impact
high
##### Description

During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1377618](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377618)

#### [#CVE-2017-7812: Drag and drop of malicious page content to the tab bar can open locally stored files](#CVE-2017-7812)

Reporter
Tooru Fujisawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If web content on a page is dragged onto portions of the browser UI, such as the tab bar, links can be opened that otherwise would not be allowed to open. This can allow malicious web content to open a locally stored file through `file:` URLs.

##### References

* [Bug 1379842](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379842)

#### [#CVE-2017-7814: Blob and data URLs bypass phishing and malware protection warnings](#CVE-2017-7814)

Reporter
François Marier
Impact
moderate
##### Description

File downloads encoded with `blob:` and `data:` URL elements bypassed normal file download checks though the Phishing and Malware Protection feature and its block lists of suspicious sites and files. This would allow malicious sites to lure users into downloading executables that would otherwise be detected as suspicious.

##### References

* [Bug 1376036](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376036)

#### [#CVE-2017-7813: Integer truncation in the JavaScript parser](#CVE-2017-7813)

Reporter
Abhishek Arya
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Inside the JavaScript parser, a cast of an integer to a narrower type can result in data read from outside the buffer being parsed. This usually results in a non-exploitable crash, but can leak a limited amount of information from memory if it matches JavaScript identifier syntax.

##### References

* [Bug 1383951](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1383951)

#### [#CVE-2017-7825: OS X fonts render some Tibetan and Arabic unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7825)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Several fonts on OS X display some Tibetan and Arabic characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1393624](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393624)
* [Bug 1390980](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1390980)

#### [#CVE-2017-7815: Spoofing attack with modal dialogs on non-e10s installations](#CVE-2017-7815)

Reporter
Jose María Acuña
Impact
moderate
##### Description

On pages containing an iframe, the `data:` protocol can be used to create a modal dialog through Javascript that will have an arbitrary domains as the dialog's location, spoofing of the origin of the modal dialog from the user view.
*Note: This attack only affects installations with e10 multiprocess turned off. Installations with e10s turned on do not support the modal dialog functionality.*

##### References

* [Bug 1368981](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1368981)

#### [#CVE-2017-7816: WebExtensions can load about: URLs in extension UI](#CVE-2017-7816)

Reporter
Kestrel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions could use popups and panels in the extension UI to load an `about:` privileged URL, violating security checks that disallow this behavior.

##### References

* [Bug 1380597](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380597)

#### [#CVE-2017-7821: WebExtensions can download and open non-executable files without user interaction](#CVE-2017-7821)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where WebExtensions can download and attempt to open a file of some non-executable file types. This can be triggered without specific user interaction for the file download and open actions. This could be used to trigger known vulnerabilities in the programs that handle those document types.

##### References

* [Bug 1346515](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1346515)

#### [#CVE-2017-7823: CSP sandbox directive did not create a unique origin](#CVE-2017-7823)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The content security policy (CSP) `sandbox` directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the `allow-same-origin` keyword were always specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content.

##### References

* [Bug 1396320](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396320)

#### [#CVE-2017-7822: WebCrypto allows AES-GCM with 0-length IV](#CVE-2017-7822)

Reporter
Thanh Bui
Impact
low
##### Description

The AES-GCM implementation in WebCrypto API accepts 0-length IV when it should require a length of 1 according to the NIST Special Publication 800-38D specification. This might allow for the authentication key to be determined in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1368859](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1368859)

#### [#CVE-2017-7820: Xray wrapper bypass with new tab and web console](#CVE-2017-7820)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
low
##### Description

The `instanceof` operator can bypass the Xray wrapper mechanism. When called on web content from the browser itself or an extension the web content can provide its own result for that operator, possibly tricking the browser or extension into mishandling the element.

##### References

* [Bug 1378207](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1378207)

#### [#CVE-2017-7811: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 56](#CVE-2017-7811)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.81 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
- Generated a AES-GCM key.
- Used the key to encrypt an arbitrary message using an empty buffer as the IV.
(The attached file demonstrates the steps.)
Actual results:
The encryption didn't throw any error.
Expected results:
The encryption function shouldn't accept 0-length IV.
According to NIST SP 800 38d, Section 5.2.1.1 (<http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf>), AES-GCM should allow only IVs of bit length 1 .. 2^64-1. The reason is that from ciphertexts encrypted with 0-length IVs or all-zero IVs, it is possible to determine the authentication key.

Tim, looks like a webcrypto or nss issue? Either way, can you have a look / forward as appropriate? :-)Group: firefox-core-security → core-securityComponent: Untriaged → Security: PSMFlags: needinfo?(ttaubert)Product: Firefox → Core

(In reply to thanhb from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1368859#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - AES-GCM implementation of Web Crypto API accepts 0-length IV"))
> The encryption function shouldn't accept 0-length IV.
Indeed, it shouldn't. The WebCrypto spec [1] unfortunately says nothing about that.
[1] <https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/Overview.html#aes-gcm-operations>
> According to NIST SP 800 38d, Section 5.2.1.1
> (<http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d>.
> pdf), AES-GCM should allow only IVs of bit length 1 .. 2^64-1. The reason is
The GCM spec also says: "Although GCM is defined on bit strings, the bit lengths of the plaintext, the AAD, and the IV shall all be multiples of 8, so that these values are byte strings."
So effectively we should accept IVs of length [1\*8..2^64/8) = [1..2^61) bytes. The WebCrypto spec talks about a max. IV length of 2^64 bytes - that's 8 times what GCM allows. I don't think people actually use IVs of that size but the spec seems definitely wrong here.
> that from ciphertexts encrypted with 0-length IVs or all-zero IVs, it is
> possible to determine the authentication key.
We should reject 0-length IVs in the WebCrypto API and probably also NSS itself. For IVs with len(IV) != 96 bits we could have a check to ensure the GHASH result is non-zero. This is not an issue for TLS but it might be for anyone linking against NSS and using AES-GCM directly.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWComponent: Security: PSM → DOM: SecurityEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(ttaubert)

It would certainly be ideal if we rejected that, but the standard actually mentions this as a possible use-case... I know. Also I think this is semantically a little different from just forgetting to specify the IV, or have it be completely empty. Another reason to not make this change is that we'd likely break communication with not-so-intelligent middle boxes.

Oops, yeah. I actually tested rejecting all-zero IVs first :)

This bug does not qualify for a bug bounty. Although a bug that allows a user of the API to do the wrong thing, it would be a vulnerability in that using code not Firefox itself. Bad code could re-use IV's, for an example of misuse we can't prevent.Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty-

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |

Open the web console in a new tab, and run
var obj, iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.onload = function() {
obj = iframe.contentWindow.eval(`new Proxy({}, {
getPrototypeOf: function() { alert('proxy trap'); return null; }
})`);
};
document.body.appendChild(iframe);
You can check that obj is an Xray wrapper:
Cu.isXrayWrapper(obj); // true
Then, run
obj instanceof Ci.nsIDOMWindow;
The trap runs and the alert is shown!! I think Xray is supposed to avoid this kind of things, e.g. this does not run the trap
obj instanceof Window;
Since the console uses instanceof to display objects nicely, any page can exploit this to freeze Firefox by running
var proxy = new Proxy({}, {getPrototypeOf: () => proxy });
console.log(Object.create(proxy));
Not sure it's necessary, but since Xray is a security thing and is being bypassed, I am marking this bug as core-security.

The about:newtab page is privileged (considered part of Firefox UI). Things you try on that page can behave quite differently from things done on an actual web page.Group: core-security → dom-core-security

Also keep in mind that things done in the web console are executed in a page-privileged sandbox which also can behave differently than code running in the page itself. not sure if that's relevant to this case -- I executed the code using a javascript: url in the addressbar (which should be closer to executing as if it were the page) and it still hung that child process.

Oh, I thought Firefox froze because the console code is privileged, but any webpage can bypass dom.max\_script\_run\_time just with
var proxy = new Proxy({}, {getPrototypeOf: () => proxy });
proxy instanceof Function;
Should I file another bug for this? Is this security sensitive?

Bypassing the slow script dialog isn't such a big issue.
The bigger question here is whether chrome can actually trigger a JS proxy trap on a content object over Xrays. Proxy objects are supposed to be opaque over Xrays, so if we're executing a content-defined getPrototypeOf function, we should fix that.

Good news: that's not what's happening, xrays are fine I think.
Bad news: we don't have xrays here at all, which is quite scary. Seems like we don't execute scratchpad code any more in the good old sandbox way but using DebuggerObject::executeInGlobal which seems to be stripping off xrays. I think Eddy worked on worker debugging and there it was important not to use any xpconnect wrappers maybe that is related.
Note: we're stripping off xrays even if we execute system code on an object from content scope (so instead of about:newtab the content is some regular web content) which is a serious concern, and I'm not sure what other wrappers we might stripping off...
Jim, do you know why are we using the Debugger eval for scratchpad and if that can be the reason why we don't have xray in this case? Can that mean that we don't have any security wrappers at all in this setup? (I'll try to test that hopefully today...) Also, where else do we use this eval? This might be a very important problem...Flags: needinfo?(gkrizsanits) → needinfo?(jimb)

Ehh... ignore my previous comment the example checked if Cu.isXrayWrapper(obj) is true so it seems like we indeed circumvent xrays here for some reason unintentionally. In non-e10s mode this can be reproduced executing the scratchpad in the browser context (system code) on a regular web page, which is a huge problem. But there can be other issues as well depending on what the underlying problem is. The stack is (I've added a sin(1) call before the alert() in the example):

It's not obvious to me that it's a problem if scratchpad stuff doesn't get XrayWrappers. Users aren't expecting XrayWrappers, they're expecting that their JS will run in the context of the page.

Ok, so here: <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/xpconnect/src/XPCJSID.cpp#465>
we're stripping off the xray and then call the js::GetObjectProto on the object directly, which seems like a bug, but with an extra IsProxy check we should be able to fix the problem. Does that sound like an acceptable fix?
What drives me crazy is that if I try the same example from a non-e10s window, and executing the script from browser context on some regular web content, I can still reproduce the issue (in the example then document has to be replaced with content.document ofc). With some debugging it seems like in that case we use permissive OpaqueXrayTraits which makes no sense to me since the script is running under system principal while the proxy object is from a web content scope. Unless |obj instanceof Ci.nsIDOMWindow;| enters into the compartment of obj. I can't recall how instanceof work for DOM interfaces across scopes, but if that's how they work that would explain why the issue can be reproduced in this case as well.

For scratchpad that might not be a huge problem but we have the same behavior everywhere else I think. So probably it's worth fixing it.

No, I think the real problem here is that we're bypassing the Xray layer when walking the prototype chain, which is an issue for tricky setPrototypeOf shenanigans as well. I think the correct solution here is to do the prototype walking without unwrapping, and only unwrap in the 'is this a DOM object' part.

That is exactly the wrapper I would expect in this situation. Permissive because it's not a SecurityWrapper, but OpaqueXrayTraits because we don't have any useful JSXrays to Proxy objects.

Something like this? The patch is fixing the issue and passes the xpconnect tests. How concerned should we be about landing this patch? Should I land the patch under a separate bug with some vague explanation?

I've got confused about the 'not SecurityWrapper' part. The code |obj instanceof Ci.nsIDOMWindow;| runs in a scope with system principal because of the browser context (so subject principal is system) and the obj is from a content scope (so object principal is content). How can we end up with a non-security wrapper then? What am I missing?Assignee: nobody → gkrizsanits

"Security Wrapper" in this context means "Wrapper does not subsume wrappee", which means that CheckedUnwrap is forbidden, and that we need to prevent data exfiltration. In the case of chrome->content Xrays, we want to prevent the caller from getting confused, but don't need to worry about protecting sensitive information, since the caller can see it if it wants (via wrappedJSObject).

It occurred to me that this could be a bit simpler, and it seemed easier to
write a patch rather than trying to describe in review comments. If you could
still take care of testing/landing after review I'd appreciate it.

I think obj is not guaranteed to be non-null here so IsWrapper(obj) can crash. I can replace the |while (true)| with |while (obj)| and test and land it for you, but I'm still not sure how careful we should be about landing it.

Actually the callers guarantee that we don't call this function with null obj, so it's OK as it is.

Hi Daniel, I cannot see any way this bug can be exploited badly. The worst that can happen is that when system code is trying to call instanceof on an object from another scope, it can 1) trigger a function from that other scope 2) that function can lie about the result of instanceof. This all sounds like sec moderate to me but until the bug has an official sec category I don't want to push the patch to try or land it.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

I think we missed the fact that the original code's unwrap does not stop at the window proxy, so for the cross compartment window object case the old and new method differs unintentionally (the old version returns null for the proto of the window the new version identifies the DOM object and returns true for instanceof Ci.nsIDOMWindow, so at first glance seems like a bug in the old version but I'm sure there is a reason why it had to work like this...)
The test is failing here: [1] since .document is a cross origin property access.
A few lines above during the instanceof check, for some reason we don't have a security wrapper around, so we manage to unwrap everything. Based on the exception thrown at [1] I don't know why is that the case, and why there is no security wrapper around, but maybe it's a special sandbox magic that I have not followed evolving for a while.Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

I don't understand - we're also passing stopAtOuter=false to js::CheckedUnwrap in the new version.

old:
1. unwrap (window proxy too)
2. continue
3. getProto on the unwrapped
new:
1. unwrap + check
2. getProto on the wrapped (window proxy is still on)

Yeah the new behavior seems more correct to me.

There wouldn't be a security wrapper here, because this is chrome code, right?
I'm still unclear as to what exactly is failing and why after reading [comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=1378207#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - instanceof operator can bypass Xray and run unprivileged proxy trap"). Needs more investigation, or at least explanation.Flags: needinfo?(gkrizsanits)

After global instanceof Ci.nsIDOMWindow returns true with the new patch
we end up calling global.document which throws (cross origin wrapper property access)
I \_think\_ since this is a web extension debugging test, we have a web extension sandbox with some window in the proto chain... but it's unclear to me too why we have there a security wrapper. I'm not sure if unwrapDebuggerObjectGlobal has any side effects... or it's the sandbox proxy related magic, or it's writeToGlobalPrototype related. I hoped you might know it off the top of your head, but then I will try to debug that part as well (I'm debugging it on windows so it's pretty slow, maybe I'll try to reproduce it on OSX).

Yeah, I don't understand why we have a security wrapper here, since we're definitely chrome (we're using Ci after all).
It probably has something to do with the Debugger API. The code appears to be using unsafeDereference, which I \_thought\_ switched from debugger proxies to regular security wrappers. But I'm fuzzy on those details, so you may want to talk to jimb or someone similar.

On a totally unrelated note, your patch does:
JSObject\* o = js::IsWrapper(obj) ? js::CheckedUnwrap(obj, false) : obj;
[Bug 1371865](/show_bug.cgi?id=1371865 "RESOLVED FIXED - PRE_HELPER_STUB calls method on native without rooting the reflector") implies that we should root |o| as well.

The code in that bug was calling arbitrary virtual methods on the XPCWN within |obj|. We're not doing that here, right?

We don't. I'm just curious if there is a reason not to always root for any new code just to be future proof.

Well, performance, and readability. And we have the static analysis to catch us. But doesn't so much matter, I'm fine with whatever.

So it's a sandbox proxy corner case when the sandbox is content and its proto is system (or just cross origin) and from a system compartment you call sb.document on it. Like:
var sb = new Cu.Sandbox("<http://blah.com>", {sandboxPrototype: window});
sb.document;
When SandboxProxyHandler::getPropertyDescriptor calls wrappedObject(proxy), it will find an xray on a cross origin wrapper and forwards the JS\_GetPropertyDescriptorById to it, which will ofc throw.
Long story short something, somewhere creates a sandbox that does not have permission to access its own proto (which is probably a bug), and since instanceof was buggy for window objects pre-patch this problem was undetected. Now I have to figure out where and what creates this sandbox and probably fix that code, but at least it looks like nothing scary is going on here.Flags: needinfo?(gkrizsanits)

I don't think we should change anything here, and I do believe too that the new behavior is the correct one. So I just ended up patching this code so that test stops failing. I guess I will talk to Luca about this, but it would be great if you confirmed that the comment makes sense and you agree with this decision first.

Luca, I hope my comment is descriptive enough. I'm not sure what should be the proper solution here since I'm not familiar with this code. But I'm happy to help you with working out a better solution. For the time being there is only one test that is failing because of this code and blocking me from landing an important fix, so is it OK to land this quick fix as it is and do the rest as a follow up?

As briefly discussed over IRC I'm ok with landing a quickfix for it first (and then in the meantime investigate where this sandbox is coming from), also if the global is being destroyed then it seems correct to me that we filter it from the ones that we can be considered "debuggable".

Stop bypassing the Xray layer when walking the prototype chain. v2
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Not sure. It's been like this for a while.
[User impact if declined]: Xray is waived during instanceof, and instanceof for DOMWindow does not work in some special cases.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Instanceof is well tested in general, but this exact scenario does not have a test. So it's unlikely that this patch breaks anything but it should be tested manually if the bug is fixed.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Manually.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Bug description has an STR.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: Just these 2 patches.
[Is the change risky?]: I don't think so.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: The post patch version of the code is safer than to original in every imaginable cases, plus it's unlikely that such a generic function passes all the tests if incorrect. However as this bug exists, there can always be an untested edge case... Still, I'd sleep better with this patch than without.
[String changes made/needed]: None.Flags: needinfo?(gkrizsanits)

I'm not sure. I'd be surprised if this could be exploited... What's the requirement for backporting something to ESR?

Doesn't sound like this is worth considering for ESR52 backport given [comment 39](/show_bug.cgi?id=1378207#c39 "RESOLVED FIXED - instanceof operator can bypass Xray and run unprivileged proxy trap"). Feel free to set it back to affected and nominate for approval if you feel otherwise, though.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
