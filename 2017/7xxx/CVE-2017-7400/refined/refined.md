  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) did not properly sanitize user-provided input when displaying federation mapping rules, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, authenticated administrator could inject malicious JavaScript code into federation mapping rules, which would then be executed in the browsers of other administrators when they viewed the mappings page. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities within the context of the administrator's browser.",

      "Web Interface",
       "Federation Mapping Feature"
    ],
