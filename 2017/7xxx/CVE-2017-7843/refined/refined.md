Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-7843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A privacy flaw in Mozilla Firefox allowed web workers in Private Browsing mode to write persistent data to IndexedDB.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypassing Private Browsing Protections:** The core issue is that the IndexedDB API, which is intended for persistent storage, was accessible in Private Browsing mode through web workers. This violates the expected behavior of Private Browsing, which should not store persistent data.
- **Inadequate Data Clearing:** The data written to IndexedDB by web workers in Private Browsing mode was not cleared upon exiting the private browsing session. This resulted in the persistent data across multiple browsing sessions, effectively defeating the purpose of private browsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unique Fingerprinting:** A malicious website could exploit this flaw to bypass private-browsing protections and uniquely fingerprint visitors. This could be done by writing unique identifiers to the IndexedDB which would persist even after browser restarts and clearing browsing history.
- **Persistent Tracking:** This vulnerability enables a new method of user tracking that is more persistent than traditional cookies and more difficult for users to detect and remove.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker could embed malicious code into a website.
- **Web Workers:** The malicious code would use web workers to interact with IndexedDB.
- **IndexedDB:** The vulnerability relies on the ability of web workers to write to IndexedDB, even in private browsing mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Serve Web Content:** An attacker needs to be able to serve web content to a victim through a malicious website or compromised legitimate website.
- **JavaScript Execution:** Attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Targeted User Interaction:**  The victim has to visit the attacker's webpage in a private browsing session.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "Konark" (modi.konark) of Cliqz, and the Mozilla project also acknowledged Konark as the original reporter.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 57.0.1, Firefox ESR 52.5.1 and later versions.
- The vulnerability is considered "high" severity by Mozilla and "important" by Red Hat.
- Red Hat issued security advisories RHSA-2017:3382 to address this vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.
-  A fix for this vulnerability was also included in Debian security update DSA 4062-1 for stable (stretch) and oldstable (jessie) distributions.

This detailed analysis of the vulnerability from the provided content shows a bypass of private browsing protection which leads to tracking of users and persistent storage of data, even after closing a private browsing window.
