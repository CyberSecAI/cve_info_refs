| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_12\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.62 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
It's possible to fingerprint users in private window by first-party and third-party scripts
1. Can be tracked even after browser restarts.
2. Can be tracked even after user clears Everything. (history / cookies / offline data )
Demo:
1. Visit the test page in normal window and private window:
<https://cdn.cliqz.com/browser-f/fun-demo/test-webworker-indexed-db.html>
It increments visit count, from inside the web-worker and on the page. Both using indexedDB as the storage.
Visit count this point should be 1. Meaning new unique visit.
2. Now restart the browser and visit the page again in both normal and private window.
It increments the counter to 2. Which means private-window behaviour is not as intended. The expectation is that the user is still treated as a new user.
Repeat the steps after selecting clearing everything in `clear recent history`, the counter still increments.
Actual results:
This is a serious bug, as it can be exploited for moving tracking from cookies to web-workers + indexedDB and have a persistent UUID. Which makes it possible to track a user irrespective of private window, across websites.
Also, as per the MDN documentation and this bug: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=781982](/show_bug.cgi?id=781982 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - IndexedDB does not function in private browsing mode") , private window should not have access to IndexedDB but as demonstrated web workers are able to use IndexedDB
Expected results:
1. Private window should not have access to IndexedDB even via web workers.
2. IndexedDB state should be cleaned after closing private window.
Although if the user has disabled `always` accept third-party cookies, the attack is only possible as a first-party, but even then I think private window should not allow tracking even from a first-party perspective.
Should also respect clear history / cookies / storage signal

That's currently expected (other bugs filed) because IndexedDB isn't cleared based on time, only if you "forget about this site".

I tested the steps on Nighty 58 now, and it's reproducible. It does not work, if you user sets third-party cookie settings changed to `from visited` or `never`. However, even in that case loading as first party should work.
Let me know, if I should improve the steps to reproduce.

As far as I checked, `Forget about this site` does not completely mitigate this attack. My understanding is the following:
1. There is no way to forget about a site that the user visits in PB? Assuming the user never visited that site as a first party in normal mode.
2. AFAIK, "Forget about this site", does not have an option to forget about a third-party site which can track a user, since most likely the user never visited it. If a third-party is using the above exploit, then would be interesting to see, how to delete the indexedDB for that.

Yes, because the assumption is that when you close the session we forget everything. Not doing that for IndexedDB is a major failing. I also find it surprising because I know we have tested this and I would hope we have automated tests to ensure it.

I'm surprised to hear that PB is writing site-specific data to the profile at all. Once it's in the file system's blocks, it's out of control and will never really go away again.

But because first-party can also access indexedDB in PB via workers, it should also work without changing the settings for third party cookies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Ugh, yeah, when recently looking at this code very recently I was worried about this exact situation and had a to-do to attempt to repro.
In terms of uplift we \*ABSOLUTELY\* need this on 57.
Restating the problem:
- Under the existing code, IDBFactory:mPrivateBrowsingMode is the source of authority for whether to treat the context as in private browsing mode. This is separately tracked from the OriginAttributes because of the annoying invariant that a system-principaled docshell can be in private browsing mode, but it will not have the OriginAttribute set, because we can't mutate the singleton system principal.
- IDBFactory::CreateForWindow propagates mPrivateBrowsingMode correctly.
- IDBFactory::CreateForWindow does not.
Restating the solution:
- Stop propagating the private browsing mode separately from the OriginAttribute.
- Rely on the OriginAttribute
The one minor wrinkle in this is the aforementioned "I'm a system-principaled private browsing docshell and I naively attempt to use IDB and the only thing stopping me from logging private browsing data is the existing check." I don't think code is doing this right now because of the assertion at <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/5a60492a53667fc61a62af1847d005a210b7a4f6/dom/indexedDB/IDBFactory.cpp#625> but I think we do want to have a guard that ensures that in the system-principal case, if nsILoadContext::UsePrivateBrowsing() is true, we either early fail or explicitly crash.

The crash does not happen if they are not in Private Browsing Mode (PBM). I have not debugged this problem but I guess the code is not tested for this particular case (as everyone was assuming IndexedDB is off in PBM anyway).
I guess this would go away with the proposed patch, right?

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
It's not about exploiting this bug, it's about using IDB in workers in privateBrowsing mode.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No. Just a generic PrincipalInfo.attrs() check.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 994190](/show_bug.cgi?id=994190 "RESOLVED FIXED - Modify main-thread IndexedDB to use PBackground")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Not too complex.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
low. The bug was introduced by a 'temporary' TODO if-statement.

Attached patch

[browser test of IndexedDB open calls in window/dedicatedworker/sharedworker in normal and PB windows](attachment.cgi?id=8925768&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1410106&attachment=8925768)

Here's a test that passes for me with :baku's fix and fails for me without :baku's fix applied.
These are what the failures look like WITHOUT the patch applied:
The following tests failed:
24 INFO TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | dom/indexedDB/test/browser\_private\_idb.js | IndexedDB does not work in a private-browsing Worker. - Got created, expected error
Stack trace:
chrome://mochikit/content/browser-test.js:test\_is:1010

25 INFO TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | dom/indexedDB/test/browser\_private\_idb.js | IndexedDB does not work in a private-browsing SharedWorker. - Got created, expected error
We of course \*do not\* want to land the tests concurrently with the bug because they make the problem super obvious. That said, there's not much doubt about the fix patch patching a hole in something related to private browsing and IDB.

Jan, we're also going to need QuotaManager cleanup logic for this in a follow-up. Specifically, after running the test I created, I ended up with the directory "storage/default/http+++example.com^privateBrowsingId=1" with an "idb" directory in the testing profile. (Which was empty because the test deletes the database once it's done with it.)
Should we just add cleanup logic during the quota initialization sweep, or should we do a minor version change bump?Flags: needinfo?(jvarga)

:ritu, is this something you can authorize a ride-along or last-minute RC landing for 57? I really need to emphasize:
\*THIS IS/WAS A SERIOUS GAP IN OUR PRIVATE BROWSING IMPLEMENTATION\*.
The fallout is:
- A site in private browsing can persistently store data in the user's profile using IndexedDB from a Worker thread. This data will be accessible from future private browsing sessions in an affected browser, but not from non-private browsing sessions. The data is still partitioned like a container was used. So something like "browse to bluenile.com in private browsing, close private browsing window, close firefox, start firefox, start privatebrowsing, browse to bluenile.com" will result in the data previously stored in indexeddb still being accessible.
- The name of the site the user visited in private browsing mode will be visible in the profile directory. So in the above example, there'd be a "https+++bluenile.com^privateBrowsingId=1".
- Any IDB storage used by the site will show up under our about:preferences "Site Data" "Settings..." storage UI that enumerates origins and their storage used. The UI will successfully clear the private browsing origin, but that's obviously going to be disconcerting for the users.
- If the site created one or more IDB databases but deleted them, then the origin will not show up in that storage UI, even though the profile directory that clearly identifies the site origin was visited and that it was visited in private browsing mode will exist and continue to exist. (Until we implement and land a fix for patch 25, but since that will be a somewhat more blatant patch, we do want to land that separately and later.)
To reiterate the good news:
- Private Browsing does operate like a container because of our OriginAttributes mechanism, so the data is partitioned from non-private-browsing, and will be unable to communicate with windows on the same origin not in private-browsing mode, etc.Flags: needinfo?(rkothari)

Hm, so after the fix, we should never create storage/default/http+++example.com^privateBrowsingId=1 directory because CheckPermission() is called before we call EnsureOriginIsInitialized(), right ?
Are you worried about such directories that were created before the fix ?Flags: needinfo?(jvarga)

In that case, I think a minor upgrade is not optimal, since if the user goes back to a previous version, create some dirs with ^privateBrowsingId=1 and then goes back to the original version, these dirs won't be cleared.
Major version change bump would be better, but as we know that's a pain in the ass ...
So for now I would do it as part of the quota initialization sweep and once there's a good reason to do a major version change bump, we can move the cleanup there.

Hi Andrew, I am willing to consider this one for RC2 (which we will gtb tomm) if security team agrees this is a low risk change.
Dan, Al, I know in [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - fingerprinting users in private window using web-worker + indexedDB"), your recommendation was not to take this in 57. Based on [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - fingerprinting users in private window using web-worker + indexedDB"), do you believe this is worth uplifting in RC2? Please let me know. If this needs more bake time, we can consider uplifting this in a 57.x dot release.

Really sorry guys, this is too late for 57 :(
We are going to do a rc3 this week end but in case we have any potential regression caused by this patch, we won't be able to ship 57 on Tuesday...
However, as dot releases are still a thing, we could take this as ride along (meaning that we would have to do a dot release for esr too).

Andrew told me he's running a local ESR52 build with the patch here to see if it works (and will otherwise make an ESR52-specific patch). He'll ask for esr52 approval there so we can land that at the same time as 57.x. Thanks, Andrew!

idb.patch
Both the patch and the test graft to esr52 (and release) successfully. See:
- [Comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - fingerprinting users in private window using web-worker + indexedDB") for the security approval request.
- [Comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - fingerprinting users in private window using web-worker + indexedDB") for security approval.
- [Comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106#c26 "RESOLVED FIXED - fingerprinting users in private window using web-worker + indexedDB") for general fallout of the bug.
[[ESR Approval Request Comment]]
This is sec-high. See next approval request for all other Q's.
[[Release Approval Request Comment]]
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
[Bug 994190](/show_bug.cgi?id=994190 "RESOLVED FIXED - Modify main-thread IndexedDB to use PBackground"), Firefox 35, IndexedDB on workers.
[User impact if declined]:
See [Comment 26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106#c26 "RESOLVED FIXED - fingerprinting users in private window using web-worker + indexedDB") for details, but, in short, Private Browsing is broken in DOM Workers.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
The non-Private-Browsing aspects are covered. Because so many internal Gecko subsystems depend on IndexedDB (in non-PB mode), we have massive end-to-end coverage on top of the extensive IndexedDB tests. The problem is that we didn't have enough tests of where it's not expected to work.
[Attachment 8925768](/attachment.cgi?id=8925768 "browser test of IndexedDB open calls in window/dedicatedworker/sharedworker in normal and PB windows") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8925768&action=edit "browser test of IndexedDB open calls in window/dedicatedworker/sharedworker in normal and PB windows") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8925768&action=diff "browser test of IndexedDB open calls in window/dedicatedworker/sharedworker in normal and PB windows") on this bug has been created to provide automated coverage going forward, and was tested against (then-trunk) 58, current release (just now), and current esr52 (just now) with and without the patch to verify the test correctly detects the failure and the fix correctly fixes it. The plan is to land that test once the esr52 point release and 57 point release have happened.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Yes, 2017-11-08, 14 days ago per Bugzilla.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
No, but [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - fingerprinting users in private window using web-worker + indexedDB") has a test case if someone really wanted to.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
No other uplifts required.
[Is the change risky?]:
No, it's the best.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
It's a minimal change in how we propagate a single boolean related to private browsing, eliminating the edge-cases between content pages and workers. As noted in automated test coverage discussion, the tree would turn VERY orange if we got it wrong.
[String changes made/needed]:
No changes made.Flags: needinfo?(bugmail)

Thanks for testing the new release (and originally reporting!!). The security team can weigh in with the specifics, but I believe we're waiting for the ESR52 dot release and probably for time for users to update to the new version to disclose the CVE and specific vulnerabilities fixed.

We had an issue getting ESR52.5.1 out the door. Since this issue is also fixed in that release, we don't want to disclose it before we get a new build out. It was originally going to be in the last day or so but we've been delayed until at least Monday.
Advisories don't go in the release notes anyway. It will be on the Known Vulnerabilities page for the release at <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox/>
Andrew, you won't be able to land the test before Christmas. We want the release with the fix out and with a high uptake before we land a test that shows the vulnerability.

Thanks for the details, I did not realize ESR52.5.1 was not released yet, I saw it on the FTP and thought it's released (<https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/52.5.1esr/mac/> - it's a 404 now), so will wait for a new update to test.

Reporter
Konark
Impact
high
##### Description

When Private Browsing mode is used, it is possible for a web worker to write persistent data to IndexedDB and fingerprint a user uniquely. IndexedDB should not be available in Private Browsing mode and this stored data will persist across multiple private browsing mode sessions because it is not cleared when exiting.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2017-27

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 57.0.1

Announced
November 29, 2017
Impact

Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 57.0.1

#### [#CVE-2017-7843: Web worker in Private Browsing mode can write IndexedDB data](#CVE-2017-7843)

Reporter
Konark
Impact
high
##### Description

When Private Browsing mode is used, it is possible for a web worker to write persistent data to IndexedDB and fingerprint a user uniquely. IndexedDB should not be available in Private Browsing mode and this stored data will persist across multiple private browsing mode sessions because it is not cleared when exiting.

##### References

* [Bug 1410106](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1410106)

#### [#CVE-2017-7844: Visited history information leak through SVG image](#CVE-2017-7844)

Reporter
Daniel Jackson
Impact
high
##### Description

A combination of an external SVG image referenced on a page and the coloring of anchor links stored within this image can be used to determine which pages a user has in their history. This can allow a malicious website to query user history.
*Note: This issue only affects Firefox 57. Earlier releases are not affected.*

Updating ANGLE to newer version is still affected by this issue.
And Chrome does not crash, so there must be something wrong in our Webgl context.

Attached patch

[(WIP)Bug 1402372 - Block illegal DrawElements](attachment.cgi?id=8913132&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1402372&attachment=8913132)

I observed what chrome do when they load the same webpage, it seems that the DrawElements is not legal and will be blocked as INVALID\_OPERATION, I add same validation code in our WebGL code, the crash does disappear after this modification.

This is the validation code which blocks the DrawElements command in Chrome.

Easy enough to construct a non-security bug in parallel: [bug 1404196](/show_bug.cgi?id=1404196 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-instanced draw calls must also check that at least one vertex attrib divisor is 0")
We can do sec approval for uplift and what-not in this bug.

So the parallel bug is leaving open a potential case: instanced attribs with generic (non-array) attrib values.
I'll make a testcase for this.

Marking this affected for 57 so that it will show up on relman and security triage queries.
We also could uplift now, for an RC2 build later this week.
Since I haven't started the ESR build yet, it could make ESR as well if we land patches tomorrow morning.
Ritu, dveditz, fyi, depending on sec-approval and how risky this looks for 57 we can either plan this for dot release, or get it in this week.

Should I worry that the ANGLE update in [bug 1371190](/show_bug.cgi?id=1371190 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update ANGLE to chromium/3229 in Firefox 58") seemed to revert the d3d11 fix in that bug back to passing '0' instead of '1'? It's calling a different set of methods now, though:

I'm not at all worried about taking this fix in 57 -- it's identical to the patch we took in [bug 1376399](/show_bug.cgi?id=1376399 "VERIFIED FIXED - Hard crash in FF 54 and Nightly 56 on Windows 7") except for d3d9 instead of d3d11. I am a little worried about whether we regressed that other fix (see [comment21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402372#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap buffer overflow in VertexBuffer9 (ANGLE)")) and might have to fix that, too, but I don't have the hardware to test it right now.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

This hurts. We initially found and fixed the d3d11 version on our own, but didn't identify it as a security bug. That means we didn't think about backporting it to ESR-52 ([bug 1398381](/show_bug.cgi?id=1398381 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap Buffer Overflow in CopyNativeVertexData (ANGLE)")) and we didn't look at the parallel code for d3d9 (this bug).Flags: sec-bounty? → sec-bounty+

Though actually I believe we're safe now that we skip making the actual call if `!vertCount||!instanceCount`, and always validate non-instanced draw calls as instanceCount=1 in FF58.

I do confirm that the d3d11 bug remains fixed in FF58, and the ANGLE patch(es) are not needed there, because of our new validation. The D3D11 bug is also fixed in FF57 release build 4, but this D3D9 version still repros there, as expected.

[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: sec-crit
User impact if declined: Poorly written WebGL code might crash.
Fix Landed on Version: 58+
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Very low, since we've taken this already for d3d11.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: none
See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process> for more info.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
This is more of a vector than a vuln, so it'd probably still be tough. The vector here is clear though.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
ESR52, 57
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
ANGLE update
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Yes.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Our CI tests cover this.

57 already shipped. Unless this is chemspill worthy, we're not going to take it on 57 and re-release.
This is fixed in 58 and, therefore, fixed in 59, right? So we're only talking about ESR52 for 52.6 (next release) at this point?

I'm theoretically OK with letting this go unfixed in 57, but it would be nice to deploy this fix if we chemspill for another reason.

Note also we support ESR52 through the end of June 2018 (52.8.0). So that may weigh more heavily in favor of taking this in ESR at some point, whether that's for 52.5.1 or 52.6.0.

Looking at the PoC I got wondering whether one actually hits the problematic code path if one just allows WebGL in minimum capability mode (by setting `webgl.min\_capability\_mode` to `true`) and disables things like extensions (by setting `webgl.disable-extensions`, to `true`). Or is the bug in question generic enough that it hits the users as soon as any kind of WebGL is allowed?

We should probably block 52.5.1 while we sort this out; may need to back out some stuff out.

Note that we're also shipping this in 57.0.1 and I believe Al's intending to publish an advisory for it. We should probably delay that then too.
To recap, Windows XP debug (and \*only\* Windows XP debug) is hitting asserts in the mochitest-gl test suite. We aren't seeing them on opt builds or on other Windows platforms. What isn't clear to me is what test coverage we have for this code path anywhere outside of ESR52 - are our Win7 machines (which have SP1 and no platform update) also hitting the d3d9 path, or are they on d3d11?
It's really unclear what the severity is here, especially with opt tests passing. FWIW, when I run 52.5.1 locally on my Win10 machine with webgl.angle.try-d3d11 set to false (which IIUC forces d3d9 mode on ANGLE), I was able to run various WebGL demos on <https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome?tag=WebGL> without any obvious issues.

The reasoning doesn't seem strong to me: one could fetch per-vertex positions from textures or generate in code with `gl\_VertexID`, so the case should be valid.

The logic for the restrictions comes pretty directly from that spec. It's to appease D3D9 (I believe) which requires at least one non-instanced vertex attrib.

If you agree, could you please do that?Flags: needinfo?(ryanvm)

Backed out from release and ESR52. We'll target Fx58 and ESR 52.6.0 for shipping this fix instead.

I guess I am confused but it seems 57.0.1 got out and includes the fix. So, "wontfix" seems wrong. Or am I missing something?Flags: needinfo?(ryanvm)

Of note is that we updated ANGLE in 51, 55, and 58. The update in 55 is a point of uncertainty between release57 and esr52.

FWIW, release57 asserts in my local build, running webgl-torture-attribs. After finishing here, I will look at why release57 wasn't seeing asserts in our CI testcases for this.

As such, I'm encouraged to ship the old fix with a fix-up of fixing the assert.

Jeff, is the code path for this bug generic enough that users are affected as soon as they have any WebGL enabled or would it be fine for those that only have minimum capability mode on and no extensions and WebGL2 allowed? From looking at the PoC and various patch proposals in this bug it seems to me having all those things set/disabled would mitigate the problem. I am still trying to understand the impact of this bug for Tor Browser users.

Our team can confirm that the initial issue is not reproducible anymore using 57.0.2-build2 (20171206182557)and 52.5.2esr-build2 (20171206101620) on Windows 10 x64, Windows 7 x64 and Ubuntu 16.04 x64.
On macOS 10.13 (and Mac OS X 10.11.6) the 2 above mentioned builds trigger @ GLEngine@0x147a9d and @ mozilla::WebGLContext::GetError crashes (with and without hardware acceleration enabled) when using the testcase from [comment 64](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402372#c64 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap buffer overflow in VertexBuffer9 (ANGLE)") (the one from [comment 62](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402372#c62 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap buffer overflow in VertexBuffer9 (ANGLE)") is only opening a blank page). The 52.5.0esr (20171107091003) build has the same behavior.
Any thoughts about this?

#### [#CVE-2017-7843: Web worker in Private Browsing mode can write IndexedDB data](#CVE-2017-7843)

Reporter
Konark
Impact
high
##### Description

When Private Browsing mode is used, it is possible for a web worker to write persistent data to IndexedDB and fingerprint a user uniquely. IndexedDB should not be available in Private Browsing mode and this stored data will persist across multiple private browsing mode sessions because it is not cleared when exiting.

#### [#CVE-2017-7844: Visited history information leak through SVG image](#CVE-2017-7844)

Reporter
Daniel Jackson
Impact
high
##### Description

A combination of an external SVG image referenced on a page and the coloring of anchor links stored within this image can be used to determine which pages a user has in their history. This can allow a malicious website to query user history.
*Note: This issue only affects Firefox 57. Earlier releases are not affected.*

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
