**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from a lack of sanitization of command parameters passed to the `gpg` binary within the Horde-Crypt library when handling PGP data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command injection vulnerability. Specifically,  the application fails to properly sanitize parameters passed to the gpg binary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the web server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, data theft, or further attacks on other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a maliciously crafted PGP signed email to a Horde user.
- The user must either view or preview the malicious email to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a vulnerable Horde user.
- The target user must have the "Should PGP signed messages be automatically verified when viewed?" preference enabled.
- For Horde Webmail versions 5.2.0 or greater, the server administrator must have enabled the inline viewing of PGP data.
