- **Root cause of vulnerability**: DLL hijacking in the Veritas System Recovery patch installer. The installer loads DLLs from the same directory it is executed from, without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The installer is vulnerable to DLL hijacking because it loads DLLs from its working directory. An attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name as one that the installer attempts to load, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If an attacker successfully replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious one, they can gain full control of the user's system, provided the user is running with administrator privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires convincing a user to download or copy a malicious DLL into the directory where the Veritas System Recovery patch installer is located.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer before it's executed and convince the user to run the installer. The user must have administrator privileges for full system compromise. The attacker doesn't need access to the system prior to the attack, just to convince the user to place the malicious DLL.
