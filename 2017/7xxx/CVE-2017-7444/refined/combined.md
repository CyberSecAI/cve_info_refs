## Issues

#### Issue #1

DLL hijacking vulnerability in Veritas System Recovery patch installer

CVE ID: [CVE-2017-7444](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7444)

Severity: High

CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.0 ([AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

To successfully exploit this vulnerability an attacker must convince a user to download or copy a malicious DLL into the same directory from which the Veritas System Recovery patch installer is executed before it is executed.  If an attacker was able to do that, and the user was running with administrator privileges, then the attacker would have full control of the user’s system.

Affected Products

* Veritas System Recovery 16 and earlier

## Questions

## Acknowledgement

Veritas would like to thank Himanshu Mehta for reporting this vulnerability.

## Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities
