The provided content relates to CVE-2017-7566.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) protection bypass in the `fetch_remote_file` function of MyBB. This function fetches remote files based on user-supplied URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SSRF Bypass**: The `fetch_remote_file` function's checks for disallowed remote hosts and addresses could be bypassed. Specifically, the code used `gethostbynamel` to resolve hostnames to IPs and subsequently check against blocked IPs. However, it did not validate IPs correctly when an IPv6 address was returned by `gethostbynamel`, leading to potential bypasses. The fix uses a more robust solution with `inet_pton` to pack IP addresses for comparisons.
- **Email MyCode XSS**: A cross-site scripting vulnerability existed within the email MyCode handling. The regular expressions used to parse email addresses were not sufficiently strict, allowing for XSS injection. This has been fixed by updating the regular expressions.
- **Directory Traversal in smilie module:** A directory traversal vulnerability existed in the smilie module, though specifics were not detailed in the provided files, it is listed as a fixed vulnerability in the mybb blog post.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SSRF:** An attacker could potentially use the SSRF vulnerability to make requests to internal services or external resources that the server has access to. This could lead to information disclosure, internal network scanning, or other malicious activities.
- **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Directory Traversal:** An attacker could use directory traversal to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SSRF:** An attacker would need to supply a malicious URL to a vulnerable function that utilizes the `fetch_remote_file` function within MyBB, which is not specified in the provided documents.
- **XSS:** An attacker would need to inject a crafted email address into a field that is parsed by MyBB using the vulnerable email MyCode.
- **Directory Traversal:** An attacker could potentially manipulate input to access unauthorized files or directories. The specific mechanism isn't provided in the documents.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **SSRF:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a URL to a vulnerable MyBB function.
- **XSS:** An attacker would need to be able to inject a crafted email address into a field that is processed with MyCode.
- **Directory Traversal:** An attacker would need to be able to manipulate file paths during the execution of the smilie module.
