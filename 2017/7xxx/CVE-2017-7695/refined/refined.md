Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of file extensions during file uploads in BigTree CMS. Specifically, the regular expression used to block dangerous file extensions could be bypassed by adding a space character after the extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of filenames during file upload.
*   **Inadequate Regular Expression:** The regular expression `/\.(exe|com|bat|php|rb|py|cgi|pl|sh|asp|aspx)$/i` in `/core/inc/bigtree/apis/storage.php` line 11, is vulnerable to bypass because the `$` at the end of the expression specifies that the filename must end with the defined extensions, which can be bypassed by appending space characters after the malicious extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a file with a malicious extension like `php ` (note the space), an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server by accessing the uploaded file via web request.
*   **Webshell:** This can lead to a webshell, giving the attacker further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload Functionality:** An attacker would exploit the file upload functionality in the BigTree CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to File Upload:** The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload function of the application. This usually requires some level of authorization, either being an authenticated user or a guest if the upload function does not require authentication.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to create malicious files and have some understanding of the way web applications interact with the server and how to access uploaded files via web requests.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content includes a commit that fixes this issue:
* The commit `8cf4212ea40e1b843e1aecf4b24681b0964ec04c` modifies the regular expression in `/core/inc/bigtree/apis/storage.php` from `'/\\.(exe|com|bat|php|rb|py|cgi|pl|sh|asp|aspx)$/i'` to `'/\\.(exe|com|bat|php|rb|py|cgi|pl|sh|asp|aspx)/i'`. This removes the `$` character at the end of the regex, thus resolving the issue and preventing bypass by appending whitespace.
