### Description

A vulnerability exists in the Management Web Interface of PAN-OS, that could allow for Information Disclosure. The Management Web Interface does not properly validate certain permissions which could allow for Information Disclosure. (Ref # PAN-70541 / CVE-2017-7644)

Successfully exploiting this issue would require an attacker to be authenticated.

This issue affects PAN-OS 6.1.16 and earlier, PAN-OS 7.0.14 and earlier, PAN-OS 7.1.8 and earlier

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | <= 7.1.8 | >= 7.1.9 |
| PAN-OS 7.0 | <= 7.0.14 | >= 7.0.15 |
| PAN-OS 6.1 | <= 6.1.16 | >= 6.1.17 |

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.0
Base Score:
6.5 ([CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-200 Information Exposure](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200")

### Solution

PAN-OS 6.1.17 and later, PAN-OS 7.0.15 and later, PAN-OS 7.1.9 and later

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Palo Alto Networks recommends to implement best practice by allowing web interface access only to a dedicated management network. Additionally, restrict the set of IP addresses to a subset of authorized sources that you allow to interact with the management network.
