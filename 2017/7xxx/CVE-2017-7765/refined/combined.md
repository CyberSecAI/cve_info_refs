Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

Attached file
[1-domain\_list\_sorted\_by\_alexa.txt](attachment.cgi?id=8867025)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8867025&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.96 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Firefox should prevent the “Canadian Syllabics” unicode block from rendering in domain names with characters from other unicode blocks. This was observed in data found in the Certificate Transparency log while seeking to quantify the IDN impersonation/phishing problem (raw data attached).
REPRODUCTION CASE
There are a series of characters in the “CANADIAN SYLLABICS” unicode block which can be used to impersonate other domains. I believe mixing this block with other unicode blocks should be disallowed and the punycode value should be displayed. The characters within this set that I believe could be abused:
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/unified_canadian_aboriginal_syllabics/list.htm>
(I do not know the registration status of any of the domains below)
<http://xn--youtue-084a.com/> -- youtuᖯe.com -- example domain
<http://xn--youtbe-z72a.com/> -- youtᑌbe.com -- example domain
<http://xn--uny-8wq.com/> -- ᑭuny.com -- example domain
<http://xn--oor-hxq.com> -- ᑯoor.com -- example domain
<http://xn--ego-73q.com/> -- ᒪego.com -- example domain
<http://xn--fc-lym.com/> -- fcᒿ.com -- example domain is not fc2.com (alexa top 1m #97) -- this is likely the hardest to see (based on the fonts I’m using)
<http://xn--ulu-7sr.com/> -- ᕼulu.com -- example domain
<http://invalid.xn--acebook-yp9a.com/> -- ᖴacebook.com -- example domain
Tested with Firefox Nightly 55.0a1 (2017-05-11) (32-bit)
This issue has also been reported to chromium
Actual results:
unicode domains are displayed when mixing the “CANADIAN SYLLABICS” unicode block with other unicode characters.
Expected results:
Punycode values should have been displayed when mixing the “CANADIAN SYLLABICS” unicode block with other unicode characters.
---- background ----
(please excuse the length of this report)
To form the attached lists, I cross referenced the Google CT Pilot log and the Alexa top 1 million domains (only .com domains).
There are a fair number of false positives (non-abusive domain impersonations or python unidecode failures), but I choose not to manually remove them.

According to <http://unicode.org/repository/draft/trunk/Public/security/10.0.0/IdentifierStatus.txt> the Canadian Syllabics block (U+1400 -> U+167F) is not allowed in identifiers, and therefore not in IDNA2008. So why are we accepting them?

By default, we have network.IDN.restriction\_profile set to "moderate". At the Moderately Restrictive level[1], Canadian Syllabics characters are accepted as part of the identifier profile thanks to their status as an "Aspirational" script[2], and the Moderately Restrictive profile allows a mixture of "Latin with other Recommended or Aspirational scripts except Cyrillic and Greek"[1].
So it looks like our behavior is correct according to the specifications we're implementing; but I agree that some of these examples look problematic.
Two possible fixes:
(a) Change the default setting for network.IDN.restriction\_profile from "moderate" to "high". This will force punycode rendering for mixed Latin+UCAS labels, since this combination is not one of the handful of mixtures that the Highly Restrictive profile allows.
(b) Exclude UCAS from the scripts that are allowed to be mixed with Latin at the Moderate level, like Cyrillic and Greek. To do this, we'd need to adjust the lookup tables used by nsIDNService::illegalScriptCombo in netwerk/dns/nsIDNService.cpp. However, given that what we're implementing here is a Unicode standard, we should also suggest a change to UTS#39 rather than simply deviate from the standard.
I'd suggest that we do (a) immediately (recognizing that it will potentially impact other mixed-script labels that are currently accepted and displayed as Unicode IDNs, but the number of real-world examples likely to be affected should be small). To consider (b), I'll raise the status of Latin+UCAS at the Moderately Restrictive level for discussion in the Unicode Technical Committee. If the UTC agrees to make a change to Moderate, we could then consider reverting our default level.

Hmm. What's the timeline for a Unicode Technical Committee discussion? Given it's taken so long for someone to notice this, I would be surprised to see an epidemic of UCAS-based spoofing starting tomorrow.
If we want to switch to Highly Restrictive, we should try and get some data on how much impact there would be first. AIUI other browsers also picked that level, because www.<latin-bit>-<native-bit>.tld or similar is an acknowledged use case, and because of the commonality of Latin, many scripts/languages in practice borrow words or letters. But this is remembering discussions from a long time ago, so we should get data.

> Hmm. What's the timeline for a Unicode Technical Committee discussion?
Well... I could raise the issue immediately on the UTC's internal mailing list, and see if anyone chimes in with comments (provided we're happy with bringing this up in a somewhat wider forum); depending on the response, that might give an early indication of what's likely to happen (or not).
The next actual UTC meeting is at the beginning of August, so we could ask for it to be on the agenda then.

I think we should start with the mailing list. Perhaps the line to take is: "We notice there's this 'except for Cyrillic and Greek' rule. Presumably those were picked because of the extensive overlap in character shapes with Latin. How might other scripts be considered for that list? What about Canadian Syllabics, for example?"
That's a bit better than "Hey, everyone, we're worried that Canadian Syllabics can be used for phishing..."

OK, I've asked a question on the (private) UTC list; will follow up here if anything interesting comes of it.

It turns out the latest proposed update to UTS#31, aimed at Unicode 10.0, drops the "aspirational scripts" category and merges them into "limited use":
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/tr31-26.html>
This will make the UCAS characters no longer eligible to be mixed with Latin in labels, per the "Moderately Restrictive" profile in UTS#39.
I'd suggest, therefore, that we go ahead and make such a change in nsIDNService, in anticipation of the upcoming Unicode changes.

That seems like an excellent fix :-) CC Ryan so he can let Chrome know, as they might well want to make a similar change.

Attached patch

[Treat Aspirational scripts the same as Restricted, in anticipation of UAX#31 update](attachment.cgi?id=8870470&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8870470&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1364283&attachment=8870470)

This is a minimal patch to just change how the Aspirational script characters are handled. Once Unicode 10 is released and we update all our data tables, etc., the IDTYPE\_ASPIRATIONAL value will go away altogether, but in the meantime this seems the simplest way to fix the issue, and minimizes any backporting risk.

Treat Aspirational scripts the same as Restricted, in anticipation of UAX#31 update
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The issue is potential domain spoofing; the patch arguably draws attention to the "Aspirational" scripts, which might lead someone to notice the possible "lookalike" characters there. Having noticed that, exploiting is as easy as registering a domain.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not really, it's positioned as an update to match forthcoming Unicode changes.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
ESR52 will need a slightly modified patch, but it is trivial to create.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Minimal risk, and covered by unit tests.

As mentioned in <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719199> [comment #31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1364283#c31 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security: disallow \"Canadian Syllabics\" unicode block from IDN domains"), the example domains cannot be registered due to Verisign's script mixing policy:
"It turned out that Verisign's script mixing policy does not allow Latin and Canadian syllabics. As a result, none of examples in this bug report (involving mixing Latin and Canadian syllabics) can be registered in any TLDs subject to Verisign's policy.
<https://www.verisign.com/en_US/channel-resources/domain-registry-products/idn/idn-policy/registration-rules/index.xhtml>
All code points within an IDN must come from the same Unicode script. This is done to prevent confusable code points from appearing in the same IDN.
<https://www.verisign.com/assets/idn/idn-canadian-aboriginal.html> does not list any of [a-z]. "
I never attempted to register any of the domains above as I was unaware of this policy. Attempting to register any of these domains results with an error "Parameter value policy error (IDN commingles multiple scripts)"
(using the first example above)
<https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=youtu%E1%96%AFe>
It appears that this is still register-able with certain ccTLD's, but that does significantly limit the scope of this issue.
Thanks,
Sam

re [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1364283#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security: disallow \"Canadian Syllabics\" unicode block from IDN domains"): moderately restrictive vs highly restrictive
> All code points within an IDN must come from the same Unicode script. This is done to prevent confusable code points from appearing in the same IDN.
A lot of TLDs have a similar policy. Armenia, Israel, Thai, India, Saudi Arabia do not allow mixing of their native scripts with Latin. They only allow a subset of characters in their native scripts and ASCII digits and hyphen. Exceptions are CJK TLDs. ICANN's per-language LRGs also acknowledge that.
So, using 'moderately restrictive' profile instead of 'highly restrictive' profile has little practical impact.
<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=726950> has more information I collected.
I can file a new bug to talk about 'moderately vs highly' restrictive profiles.

Hi, I intend to discuss this issue at a DEFCON (wall of sheep) talk next Friday 7/28. As information about this bug is public through [CVE-2017-5076](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-5076) and the Firefox CVE ( <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2017-16/#﷒1>﷓ ) I do not see any problem with this, but I did want to give you a headsup as this issue is still labeled as restricted.

[85231FFExploit.htm](attachment.cgi?id=8753042)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8753042&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2486.0 Safari/537.36 Edge/13.10586
Steps to reproduce:
Dan from Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR) here. We’ve found a way to bypass Mark of the Web in FireFox. I have a repro available at the following URL: <http://payloadhoster.cloudapp.net/85231FFExploit.htm>
(the same file is attached, but would need to be hosted somewhere along with a file to download in order to repro the issue)
To reproduce the issue:
1. On a Windows 10 machine with Office installed, browse to the page in Firefox
2. Click the link
3. Select either to save the file locally, or open in PowerPoint
This vulnerability appears to be caused by links with a “download” attribute that causes the filename to be longer than what’s allowed in Windows. It’s likely that the cause here is trying to call one Windows API or another with a string that’s too long.
Thank you for reviewing this report and we'll pass on any questions from the engineering team to the finder promptly. We look forward to hearing your team's analysis. For our prompt attention, please email msvr@microsoft.com and reference MSVR 1533 in the title.
Actual results:
mark of the web is not applied in either case
Expected results:
mark of the web is applied and the file is open in protected view

AIUI this is because of:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/jsdownloads/src/DownloadIntegration.jsm#632>
which is going to have the file name suggested by the download attribute.
Now... we could change the filename to not be so long, but AIUI the filename needs to match that of the file we're saving, otherwise it still won't be marked as "from the web". I don't know where we modify the actual filename - presumably, we need to ensure that we save the file somewhere where it doesn't actually get the super-long filename, and we have 'space' left at the end to tag on the ":Zone.Identifier" stuff.
Paolo originally wrote this code ([bug 909022](/show_bug.cgi?id=909022 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mark all executables as coming from the Internet zone on Windows")), and generally knows our download code, so I think it'd be best if he took this.Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

We rely indirectly on the nsIFile.createUnique function to shorten the path at the time it is chosen, it can be tricky to make room for the ":Zone.Identifier" part there:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/DownloadPaths.jsm#55>
We could try prepending "\\?\" during our "OS.File" call in Downloads.jsm to increase the 260 characters limit for that particular operation, I'm not sure if that works with the Alternate Data Stream syntax though. We may have to be careful about features we lose like the automatic conversion of forward slash to backslash.Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

I experimented with the prefix on my Windows 7 system on an NTFS partition:
let streamPath = "\\\\.\\" + aDownload.target.path + ":Zone.Identifier";
This still result in Windows error 3 (The system cannot find the path specified), presumably returned when CreateFileW is called by OS.File. I also tried this without the ADS syntax, just in case:
let streamPath = "\\\\.\\" + aDownload.target.path + "\_Zone.Identifier";
And the result is the same. So, apparently the prefix that according to the documentation should increase the limit accepted by the API to 32767 characters doesn't work here.

CreateUnique makes an assumption that 255 excluding the NUL terminator works for all platforms:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/io/nsLocalFileCommon.cpp#53>
For the rest, we don't have to check for MAX\_PATH explicitly because the OS will raise an error for us if needed. The issue we have only arises when we append the ADS syntax to the file name.

Is anything going to be terribly upset if we just #ifdef XP\_WIN that limit to whatever MAX\_PATH is on Windows minus the length of the ADS syntax ? Or is that a dumb idea for other reasons? :-)

It's kind of linked to the specific ADS name we are using, ":Zone.Identifier", so not terribly great but it's a quick and dirty solution that could work as I think it's the only ADS we'll ever use (hehe, I mean, the only ADS we're currently using).
We may introduce regressions as we may prevent downloads to be saved at all in deeply nested folders where it would be otherwise legitimate to have a short file name, but it may be a cost we need to pay if the Windows API doesn't give us a better solution anyways...

Thanks for asking, I have a technical question for you from [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1273265#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox Mark of the Web bypass (MSVR 1533)"). We might be dealing with a limitation of the Windows API or NTFS with regard to file name length in the presence of an ADS. It's possible this is something that should be fixed on the Microsoft side, even though we might have a workaround.
I experimented with the prefix on my Windows 7 system on an NTFS partition:
let streamPath = "\\\\.\\" + aDownload.target.path + ":Zone.Identifier";
This still result in Windows error 3 (The system cannot find the path specified), presumably returned when CreateFileW is called by OS.File. I also tried this without the ADS syntax, just in case:
let streamPath = "\\\\.\\" + aDownload.target.path + "\_Zone.Identifier";
And the result is the same. So, apparently the prefix that according to the documentation should increase the limit accepted by the API to 32767 characters doesn't work here.
What are the correct Windows API calls to apply an ADS to a file with a long name using the Windows API?

They've gotten back to me to say that the syntax you're looking for might be \\?\ rather than \\.\
Also, I'm not currently receiving email sent to me through Bugzilla, due to issues with S/MIME on my end. I'm not sure if that matters, but I'm working on getting is solved.

Ah, sorry! So, just prepending \\?\ works fine and it fixes the bug when saving to a local file system. If I understand correctly, however, it won't give the correct result for UNC paths, and won't normalize slashes into backslashes.
So here is a new question for the API owners: do I really have to pass the path to the undocumented RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName\_U function to work around the MAX\_PATH limit and still preprocess the path, as described in the following blog post I just found?
<https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.it/2016/02/the-definitive-guide-on-win32-to-nt.html>
If the conversion rules are very simple we might just reimplement them in JavaScript without the complications of accessing an ntdll export.
Note that we want to keep compatibility back to Windows 7 at least.

Based on discussion with API owners: You can get the canonicalized path name by prepending \\?\ and then calling GetFullPathName on the full string. There should be no need to call RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName\_U. The resulting path should be passable to any Win32 API for saving files and not subject to MAX\_PATH limits.
This will probably end up giving the user a file they can't open due to its filename being too long.
Filename segments are still limited to 255 characters, so you'll still need to truncate in some way. My impression is that you have some other solution to that issue already.
Is that enough information to help you solve this issue?

That works for converting slashes to backslashes, but still doesn't support UNC paths out of the box.
Considering that we are operating under some well known restrictions, and we don't need to provide generic access to paths whose length is beyond MAX\_PATH, I've special cased the UNC "DOS" paths and I believe that it works sufficiently well in combination with GetFullPathName for the problem we're trying to solve here.
The only issue would be if GetFullPathName misses other normalizations that RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName\_U does, beyond handling UNC paths, resulting in an attempt to access a file with a different name in the presence of some special characters, but this is for the API owners to tell. Note that we filter allowed file names, and we've already accessed the file before.

We already operate withing the MAX\_PATH limitations for all other operations, and I've tested the file can still be opened and its properties inspected from Windows Explorer after the ADS is added.
> Is that enough information to help you solve this issue?
I'll post a patch with an implementation that solves the bug for the test case, when saving to local paths or UNC paths. I may need more information on the normalization question above, and the patch can be a good starting point if the API owners want to take a look.

Most Windows APIs actually accept forward slashes and convert them to backslashes automatically, so we need to check for forward slashes as well. Given that this path prefix is set by the Firefox preferences UI, though, it is unlikely that the full path checked here would have forward slashes, unless about:config has been edited directly by an advanced user.

Sorry for the delay in getting this patch reviewed. There were a few complications on our end.
I've had people knowledgeable about path canonicalization examine the source for this patch, and they say it looks correct. I have not been able to perform any practical testing of the patch itself, as it's not clear that I can actually build Firefox from source.
Is that enough for you to move forward with checking in this fix? You still have the original repro to check your fix against for practical testing.Flags: needinfo?(jobirch)

Thanks, this is definitely helpful! I'm asking Jim for the final review.

It will be a while before I can find the time to put together a test case, as I'm traveling right now. It's definitely possible to have one, it would just rely on the same new API when reading the Alternate Data Stream.
Any test case would need to be verified in automation, but only after we've landed the patch properly in all branches. I'm not quite sure about the landing process for security patches.

This bug is rated sec-moderate, so as far as I understand <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process> you should be able to land the patch without explicit sec-approval once it has review. You'll probably want to ask for approval for branch patches for 53 and 54, and possibly 52-esr. The wikipage suggests NOT landing tests until after we ship the fix.
That said, I would strongly encourage you to write the test ASAP, and run it against beta locally (not on try) after you create a branch patch, to ensure we actually fix the issue and successfully test for it in automation, even if we then don't land it until afterwards.
Does that answer your question?Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

I ran the test locally on Nightly for now, not on a Beta build yet. The affected OS.File code has not been touched very much recently, and I expect the patch to apply cleanly to all branches.
It looks like we might be able to land the patch in the next two days, for Beta 10:

The patch
This bug is sec-moderate because it cannot be used alone to run arbitrary code on the user's computer, but it removes the security warning that the Windows operating system shows before running executables downloaded from the Internet.
While sec-approval is not needed, I'm requesting it so I can get help with the landing process. I'll be around in the next few days, but note that the sheriffs may also be able to land the patch without assistance if needed.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
- Easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
- People familiar with the Windows file system can very easily understand the issue being fixed.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
- All branches
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
- The patch should apply easily to all branches
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
- There is a very slim chance of regressions with file names with special characters, but this is mitigated by the fact that the code has been reviewed by Microsoft experts.

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

#### [#CVE-2017-7765: Mark of the Web bypass when saving executable files](#CVE-2017-7765)

Reporter
Jonathan Birch and Microsoft Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-5470: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 54, Firefox ESR 52.2, and Thunderbird 52.2](#CVE-2017-5470)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53, Firefox ESR 52.1, and Thunderbird 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

#### [#CVE-2017-5470: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 54 and Firefox ESR 52.2](#CVE-2017-5470)

Reporter

critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
