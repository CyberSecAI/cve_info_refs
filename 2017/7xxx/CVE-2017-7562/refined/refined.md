      ]
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "The krb5 certauth interface, specifically the EKU module, incorrectly authorized client certificates based solely on the Extended Key Usage (EKU) field, without verifying Subject Alternative Name (SAN), leading to a potential authentication bypass.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of client certificates in krb5's certauth interface, specifically the EKU module.",
        "Failure to verify the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field in client certificates during PKINIT authentication.",
          "The EKU module incorrectly returning success instead of KRB5_PLUGIN_NO_HANDLE, leading to authoritative authorization based on EKU alone."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker able to communicate with the Key Distribution Center (KDC) could potentially impersonate arbitrary principals under rare and erroneous circumstances by using a forged certificate with the correct EKU but without a matching SAN.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Network communication with the KDC.",
         "Use of a forged client certificate with a valid EKU but no matching SAN."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "Ability to communicate with the KDC.",
        "Ability to forge a client certificate with a valid EKU and no matching SAN.",
          "The attack relies on specific conditions to be met, making the exploitation rare and erroneous."
      ],

        "EPSS score": "0.166%"
    },
    "Fix": {
        "Fix_description": "The fix involves modifying the pkinit_eku_authorize() function in the EKU module to return KRB5_PLUGIN_NO_HANDLE on success instead of 0 and ensuring that the SAN module correctly handles certificates with no SANs, and not rejecting them aggressively.",
