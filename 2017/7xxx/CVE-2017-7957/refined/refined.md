{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The XStream library is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when unmarshalling (deserializing) data. Specifically, if the input stream contains type information that advises XStream to create an instance of the primitive type 'void', the application will crash because such an instance cannot exist.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a crash on the target system, resulting in a denial-of-service by manipulating the input stream that is processed by XStream.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the incoming data stream being processed by XStream",
      "The crafted input stream needs to include instructions to create an instance of the 'void' type."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input stream processed by XStream and inject type information that triggers the vulnerability."

    "Use XStream's security framework to deny the 'void' type: `xstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ void.class, Void.class });`",
