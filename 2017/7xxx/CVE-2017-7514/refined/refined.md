Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in how Red Hat Satellite 5 processes failed action entries. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `Schedule -> Failed Actions -> <action> -> Failed Systems` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input within the failed action entry. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS Attacks:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of other Satellite users who view the affected page.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** XSS can be used to steal cookies or session tokens, potentially leading to user account compromise.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker might perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user without their consent or knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Failed Action Entry:** An attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious failed action entry. This could be done through direct manipulation of client-side code or by using the `schedule.failSystemAction` API call to create a custom failure message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to specify a failed action:** The attacker needs the ability to specify a failed action entry, either through a crafted API call or by altering client-side code to generate the malicious entry.
*   **Targeted User Interaction:** The attack is successful when another Satellite user views the page where the malicious script is rendered, specifically the `Schedule -> Failed Actions -> <action> -> Failed Systems` page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jan Hutar of Red Hat.
*   The fix was included in Red Hat Satellite 5.8 and addressed via RHSA-2017:1558.

In summary, CVE-2017-7514 is a moderate severity XSS vulnerability that allowed attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into a specific page of Red Hat Satellite 5, potentially leading to account compromise and other malicious actions. The attacker needs to be able to create a failed action entry containing the malicious payload and the exploit requires user interaction, specifically another Satellite user viewing the page displaying this entry.
