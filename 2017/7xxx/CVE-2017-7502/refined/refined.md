Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7502:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from `bugzilla.redhat.com`, `access.redhat.com`, and `www.debian.org` explicitly mentions "CVE-2017-7502" and provides descriptions consistent with a null pointer dereference related to handling empty SSLv2 messages in NSS. The upstream patch link also confirms this.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a null pointer dereference within the Network Security Services (NSS) library. This flaw is triggered when the server receives empty SSLv2 messages. The vulnerability was introduced with recent changes in NSS code where SSLv2 protocol support was removed and a new parser for handling SSLv2-style hello messages was introduced. The code fails to handle empty messages correctly, leading to a dereference of a null pointer.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability lies in the improper handling of an empty SSLv2 message, causing a pointer dereference.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this flaw to crash a server application that uses the affected NSS library. This makes the server unavailable to legitimate users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted (empty) SSLv2 messages to a vulnerable server.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
   - The attacker must have the ability to craft or send an SSLv2 message with an empty body.

**7. Additional Details:**
   - The issue arose after the removal of SSLv2 protocol support from the upstream NSS code in version 3.24.0, and the introduction of a dedicated parser for SSLv2-style hello messages.
   - The fix involves a patch that addresses the null pointer dereference when NSS receives empty SSLv2 messages.

**Summary of extracted information:**

| **Root Cause**                | Null pointer dereference when NSS receives an empty SSLv2 message.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Weakness**                  | Improper handling of empty SSLv2 messages in the NSS parser.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Impact**                    | Crash of the server application using the vulnerable NSS library, leading to a Denial of Service.                                                                                                                    |
| **Attack Vector**             | Sending crafted SSLv2 messages with empty bodies to a vulnerable server.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Attacker Capabilities**      | Ability to send network packets to the server, ability to craft or send an SSLv2 message with an empty body. No authentication required.                                                                                   |
| **Additional Notes**          | The vulnerability was introduced after removing SSLv2 support and adding a new parser, a fix for the vulnerability and an updated CA list, and that applications need to be restarted after installing the update. |
