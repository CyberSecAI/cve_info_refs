## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 57

Announced
November 14, 2017
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 57

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

##### References

* [Bug 1406750](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406750)
* [Bug 1412252](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412252)

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

##### References

* [Bug 1408990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990)

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

##### References

* [Bug 1392026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026)

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1370497](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497)

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

##### References

* [Bug 1402363](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363)

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1401339](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339)

#### [#CVE-2017-7837: SVG loaded as <img> can use meta tags to set cookies](#CVE-2017-7837)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

SVG loaded through `<img>` tags can use `<meta>` tags within the SVG data to set cookies for that page.

##### References

* [Bug 1325923](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923)

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

##### References

* [Bug 1399540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540)

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

##### References

* [Bug 1402896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896)

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

##### References

* [Bug 1366420](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366420)

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.

* [Bug 1397064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064)

#### [#CVE-2017-7827: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 57](#CVE-2017-7827)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[bookmarks.html](attachment.cgi?id=8869635)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8869635&action=edit)

It is possible to inject Javascript into the HTML export file of the bookmark manager via the Tags field.
To reproduce:
\* Create a bookmark with a tag like " onmouseover="alert(1)" "
\* Export bookmarks to HTML via bookmark manager
\* open bookmarks.html file and move over the bookmark
This is almost certainly not intended and the tags should be properly escaped. I thought a while whether this would have any security implications. I couldn't come up with a realistic scenario where this matters, but one could construct less realistic scenarios (e.g. a publicly available firefox installation where the bookmarks of the users are regularly exported and uploaded to a webpage). So I'd say it's a very low severity security issue, but still should be fixed.

I'm assuming we've long cleaned up titles and other elements that can be set by the page. If it's only tags this is essentially self-xss, but I worry about how we missed escaping on that field. Are any others affected?Flags: needinfo?(mak77)Keywords: [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)Whiteboard: self-xss

hm, cool, I had written a long reply, but then I've lost it due to some recent bugs breaking sessionhistory :(
Btw, let's sum up.
The bug is here:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/a14524a72de6f4ff738a5e784970f0730cea03d8/toolkit/components/places/BookmarkHTMLUtils.jsm#1146>
We have an escapeHTMLEntities util, but we didn't apply it to tags (ooops)
HTML is an obsolete format for bookmarks, we keep it for 2 reasons:
1. default bookmarks are still in this format
2. sharing with third party software (yes, an add-on could probably cover this)
The only ways to generate a Bookmarks.html are:
a. manually set autoExportHTML pref
b. go to the Library window and Export Bookmarks
In general we don't strip html from strings, nor we do much sanitization on input. Most services/components are unlikely to sanitize string contents for each of their APIs. The html export case is special and that's why we have escapeHTMLEntities, the json export does escaping by itself for example.
The only strings we get from Content are title and description, both are read from the document, doesn't looks like we do much sanitization of their content on input.
Maybe we should consider having a centralized sanitization method and make every API pass strings through it?
Are we worried only about html exports, or are there other cases that come to your mind we should pay attention to?Flags: needinfo?(mak77)Priority: -- → P2

Given that there's no visible activity on fixing this and it's been open several months I intend to disclose this bug within a week.

well, it's self xss and sec-low, so it makes sense it didn't get much priority. That said, the fix looks simple enough that it's worth just doing it.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3223.0 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Visit <https://www.bayden.com/test/controlchars.html>
2. Select all of the text in the box on the page \*except\* the first character
3. Copy
4. Go to Address bar.
5. Hit paste.
Actual results:
JavaScript is pasted and executes if enter is hit.
Expected results:
Text up to and including "JavaScript:" should be stripped.
Firefox, like Chrome and IE, attempts to prevent the user from pasting JavaScript into the address bar.
Unfortunately, as discovered in <https://crbug.com/766010>, these protections can be circumvented by introducing leading control characters into the string.

function stripUnsafeProtocolOnPaste(pasteData) {
// Don't allow pasting javascript URIs since we don't support

let changed = false;
let pasteDataNoJS = pasteData.replace(/\r?\n/g, "")
.replace(/^(?:\s\*javascript:)+/i,
() => {
changed = true;
return "";
});
return changed ? pasteDataNoJS : pasteData;

Eric: thanks for the report!
I would like to mark this sec-low and open it up, given the chrome bug items are all public and that this isn't \*much\* better for a malicious actor than saying something like "copy-paste 'iavascript:alert(...)' and replace the first 'i' with 'j' in the location bar".
(It's obviously a little better, and we should fix it, but the control characters sure look... odd... and this is all just a best-effort type thing anyway.)Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Public is fine to me. (FWIW, when I was a PM on IE and we did the lockdown, a popular social network reported the JavaScript-paste vector was getting exploited hundreds of thousands of times per hour.)

Why is this even a valid URL? Sure, we strip whitespace and a couple of these count but we're left with what should be an invalid scheme <junk>javascript: or treating them as two tokens in which case it should be a search.
The patch here looks fine and works, just wondering if we have a separate issue with the Address Bar. If you create a link with that text as the "src" it's an invalid link and does nothing. Something in the Address Bar is parsing that out and throwing it away before handing the URL part off. Probably should not be that helpful -- let the user clean up the junk, or trigger a search (which is what happens if I put a non-CTRL char in the middle of the junk).Group: firefox-core-securityFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [csectype-other](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-other&resolution=---),

I think this is a VERY GOOD question!
And I agree that the patch doesn't fully cover the problem.
I think it all boils down to this:
Services.uriFixup.getFixupURIInfo(` javascript:alert("Malicious. " + document.cookie)//<https://fake>`, Ci.nsIURIFixup.FIXUP\_FLAG\_FIX\_SCHEME\_TYPOS |
Ci.nsIURIFixup.FIXUP\_FLAG\_ALLOW\_KEYWORD\_LOOKUP).preferredURI.spec
In practice, the Location Bar trusts uriFixup to make proper choices, looks like in this case it's indeed doing a nice fixup, but it's excessive.

may we get a test in browser\_removeUnsafeProtocolsFromURLBarPaste.js?
Also, you have touched urifixup quite a bit in the recent past, any idea how to solve the more global problem with it being too "liberal" into cleaning up special chars?

Uhh, so:
makeURI(" javascript:alert(document.cookie)")
also produces the correct URI.
So I don't think this is URI fixup as much as it is URI parsing. In fact, reading:
<https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser>
I think this is correct per-spec. In particular:
> If url is not given:
> 1) Set url to a new URL.
> 2) If input contains any leading or trailing C0 control or space, validation error.
> 3) Remove any leading and trailing C0 control or space from input.
Note that "validation error" does not mean parsing terminates, per <https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#validation-error> .
Valentin or Anne, can you confirm my spec-reading?Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

Bugzilla is being "helpful" and sanitizing input, but this should be something along the lines of:
makeURI("\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006javascript:alert(document.cookie)")
(where makeURI is for all intents and purposes an alias of Services.io.newURI)

This doesn't match what I'm seeing on 57:
data:text/html,<a href="%01%02%03%04%05%06%07%08%10%11%12%13%14%15%16%17%18%19javascript:alert(location.href);">Click</a>
works if clicked. I think we're dropping stuff after %00 at some point, presumably prior to it arriving at the URI parser, which is presumably also why [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Specially-crafted JavaScript may be pasted into the address bar") suggests selecting everything except the first character (which is a null byte instead of all the non-zero C0 control characters). :-)

Per the standard these are removed by the URL parser as you found in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Specially-crafted JavaScript may be pasted into the address bar"). I'll leave the needinfo for Valentin since I don't know where we implement that in our stack. Note that per the URL Standard U+0000 NULL would be removed too, that not happening here is strange and maybe indicative of another subtle issue.
Furthermore, if there is any address bar sanitization, that should take place after parsing the URL into an object, not before. Only at that point can you trust the definitive scheme.

We don't parse as a URL at the point of pasting (only when the user hits go/enter/whatever to load the final URL), and we don't want unsanitized content to enter the url bar, so the only way to do this is to duplicate the exact URI fixup that the url bar's autocomplete/navigation code uses later on, and do the exact same thing at the point of pasting, which is also fragile. :-(
> Only at that point

Not really... URI fixup might either change the scheme of a valid URL, or come up with a valid URL (which may be a search URL) even if URL parsing itself failed.

Fixup makes sense, but to figure out if it's scheme is X you should really consider roundtripping through the parser. Or maybe add some very visible comment to point out which pieces of code need to be kept in sync for security purposes and hope that folks pay attention... Or alternatively add some logic to the navigation code that enforces the restrictions the address bar wants to keep.

Unfortunately we still want to allow people to do user-initiated toplevel js: navigation because bookmarklets and the like (obviously pages do lots of this stuff with <a href="javascript:..."> anyway, but if we wanted to we could batten down the URL bar / bookmarks hatches - we just don't (want to close them completely)). So instead we just try to make it harder for malicious actors.
TBH, I wonder if the time has come to stick that type of thing behind a pref (browser.urlbar.javascript.enabled ?) and force a dialog if the user tries to navigate to a JS URL (with either the url bar or bookmarks or drag/drop) without that pref flipped.

Separate bug? Seems reasonable for copy-and-paste or user-entered javascript URLs. (Though we should also consider restricting the developer tools on release in that case if we haven't already as it's pretty similar attack-wise.)

The devtools already have a paste warning, yeah.

What I meant was not making them available, similar to stable Safari. Warnings are easily ignored.

>we should also consider restricting the developer tools
Restricting the Developer Tools console so that all forms of pasted JavaScript won't run seems like an idea likely to provoke outrage.
Or is something else being suggested here?

I think if we clearly communicate why we'd make such a change and what steps can be taken as workaround (e.g., use the Developer's Edition) it might turn out okay. As I said we wouldn't be the first browser to do it and it's an attack vector that's being used against end users.

This is done in nsSimpleURI/nsStandardURL::SetSpec [1][2] by calling net\_FilterAndEscapeURI/net\_FilterURIString [3] which strips whitespace at the beginning and end of the string.
> Note that per the URL Standard U+0000 NULL

We do strip out the leading U+0000 too for example this:
var url = new URL("\u0000\u0001\u0002javascript:alert('hello')"); url.href
It's possible some calls pass around regular C strings when creating URLs, which causes stuff after \0 to be ignored.

The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
