  "cveId": "CVE-2017-7840",
  "description": "JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied tags when exporting bookmarks to HTML format.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient output sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when an exported bookmarks file containing malicious tags is opened in a browser.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Social engineering attack to convince user to add malicious tags to bookmarks",
      "Export of the malicious bookmarks to HTML file",
      "Opening of the malicious HTML file in a browser"
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": [
        "Ability to add tags to bookmarks",
        "Ability to export bookmarks to HTML"
