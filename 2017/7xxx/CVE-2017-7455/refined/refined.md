Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Moxa MXview software stores its web server's private key in a publicly accessible directory within the user's application data folder (`C:\Users\TARGET-USER\AppData\Roaming\moxa\mxview\web\certs\mxview.key`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Private Key Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the web server's private key.
- **Insecure Storage:** The private key is stored in a location accessible via HTTP GET requests without any access control.
- **Lack of Authorization:** No authentication or authorization is required to access the `mxview.key` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Server Impersonation:** With the private key, an attacker could potentially impersonate the legitimate MXview web server.
- **Data Decryption:** The private key could be used to decrypt any traffic encrypted with the corresponding public key, leading to information disclosure.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:**  An attacker could use the key to perform MITM attacks on communication with the server.
- **Full Access:**  The private key may grant access to other resources/services associated with the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP.
- **HTTP GET Request:**  Attackers can retrieve the private key file using a simple HTTP GET request to `/certs/mxview.key`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network connectivity to the Moxa MXview server.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of target path:** The attacker needs to know the URL path to the private key file which is `/certs/mxview.key`.
