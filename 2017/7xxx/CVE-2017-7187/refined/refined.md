{
  "CVE-2017-7187": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing size check of user-controlled data in the `sg_ioctl` function when processing the `SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN` ioctl.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially other unspecified impacts due to out-of-bounds write access when copying data into the stack buffer in the `sg_write` function, leading to a kernel crash.",
     "Attack vectors": "A local user with access to the device file /dev/sg* can trigger the vulnerability by calling the ioctl `SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN` with a size greater than `SG_MAX_CDB_SIZE` and then calling `writev()` with that size.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access to the system and ability to open /dev/sg* device files."
  }
