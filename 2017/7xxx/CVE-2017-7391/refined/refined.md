Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the `prefix` HTTP GET parameter passed to the `magmi-git-master/magmi/web/ajax_gettime.php` URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL, specifically manipulating the `prefix` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable URL (`magmi-git-master/magmi/web/ajax_gettime.php`) and parameter (`prefix`).
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious JavaScript/HTML into the `prefix` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by using the `alert()` JavaScript function:
 `<http://localhost/.../magmi-git-master/magmi/web/ajax_gettime.php?prefix=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E%3C%22>`
- The vulnerability affects Magmi version 0.7.22 and likely prior versions.
- A fix for this vulnerability was implemented and merged into the `master` branch.
