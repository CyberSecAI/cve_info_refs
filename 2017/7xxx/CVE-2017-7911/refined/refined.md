Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient encapsulation of data within the CyberVision Kaa IoT Platform. Specifically, the `SdkServlet` and `RecordServlet` servlets within the platform convert base64 encoded request parameters into Java objects using `ObjectInputStream.readObject()`. This deserialization process, when combined with attacker-controlled data, allows for code injection due to the lack of proper validation and sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The platform uses `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` to deserialize base64 encoded data from user-controlled request parameters. This is a well-known vulnerability that allows an attacker to craft malicious serialized objects that can be executed upon deserialization.
*   **Code Injection:** By injecting malicious serialized Java objects, attackers can achieve remote code execution on the server. This stems from the use of the vulnerable deserialization process.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the data before deserialization.
*  **Insufficient Encapsulation:** The vulnerability is specifically described as an "insufficient encapsulation vulnerability" in the description.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the server. This would allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the same privileges as the Kaa application.
*   **File Manipulation:** Attackers can create new files with arbitrary content on the server. They can also move (copy and delete) files on the remote system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By executing arbitrary OS commands, the attacker can potentially gain full control of the server, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is primarily through the network, using HTTP requests to the Kaa administrator interface on port 8080.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends malicious base64 encoded serialized java objects via HTTP requests as parameters to the `SdkServlet` or `RecordServlet`.
*   **Admin Interface:** Although the admin interface requires authentication, default credentials ("kaa/kaa123") can be used, which further exposes the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Kaa server, particularly to port 8080 where the admin interface is exposed.
*   **Authentication:** Although authentication is required, the default credentials can be used if not changed.
*   **Knowledge of Java Deserialization:** The attacker needs an understanding of Java deserialization vulnerabilities and how to craft malicious serialized objects.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests containing crafted base64 encoded payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jacob Baines from Tenable Network Security.
*   The vulnerability affects Kaa IoT Platform version 0.7.4 (Avocado Archipelago) and possibly other versions.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor in 2016, but the vendor was unresponsive.
*  The attack can also be carried out using the Spring Framework also available in Kaa.
*   The vendor did not provide a solution or mitigation for the vulnerability.

**CVSS Metrics:**
The vulnerability is scored as high severity.
*   CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.3 (from ICS-CERT advisory), 8.8 (from Tenable Advisory)
*   CVSS v2 Base Score : 6.5 (from Tenable Advisory)
*   CVSS v2 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:U/RC:C)
