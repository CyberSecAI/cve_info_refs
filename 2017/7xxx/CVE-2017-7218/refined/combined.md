### Description

A vulnerability exists in the Management Web Interface that could allow for local privilege escalation. The Management Web Interface does not properly validate specific request parameters which can potentially allow executing code with higher privileges. (Ref # PAN-70426/ CVE-2017-7218)

Successfully exploiting this issue would require an attacker to be authenticated.

This issue affects PAN-OS 7.1.8 and earlier

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | <= 7.1.8 | >= 7.1.9 |

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.0
Base Score:
7.8 ([CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-20 Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20")

### Solution

PAN-OS 7.1.9 and later

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Palo Alto Networks recommends to implement best practice by allowing web interface access only to a dedicated management network. Additionally, restrict the set of IP addresses to a subset of authorized sources that you allow to interact with the management network.
