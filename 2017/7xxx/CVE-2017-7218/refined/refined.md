- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Management Web Interface does not properly validate specific request parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20). This allows an attacker to potentially execute code with higher privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation, leading to high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the management web interface is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Management Web Interface.
