- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which can be triggered by a remote attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service, making the affected device unavailable. It may also be possible for the attacker to run arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction. They need network access to the vulnerable system.
