Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-7314:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on a specific page within the Personify360 application, accessible via the URL `<http://www.site.com/TabId/275>`. This page, intended for administrative purposes, does not require authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is that the page at `/TabId/275` does not require any authentication to access. This allows any unauthenticated user to access the page's functionalities.
- **Database Schema Exposure:** Through the 'Role Configuration' section on the vulnerable page, an attacker can access a dropdown labeled 'Role Based on Table' revealing all tables in the system. Once a table is selected, the 'Customer ID Column' dropdown exposes all the column names within the selected table.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to map out all tables and columns of the Personify database without needing any credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Database Schema Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain a complete map of the database schema, including all table and column names. This information can be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** The attacker can directly access the vulnerable page through the URL `<http://www.site.com/TabId/275>`.
- **Navigation through UI:** The attacker would navigate through the vulnerable page's UI by clicking on 'Role Configuration' and interacting with the dropdowns provided.
