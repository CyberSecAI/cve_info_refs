  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2017-7555",
    "description": "Augeas versions up to and including 1.8.0 are vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of escaped strings. Attacker could send crafted strings that would cause the application using augeas to copy past the end of a buffer, leading to a crash or possible code execution.",
    "affected_versions": "Augeas versions up to and including 1.8.0",
    "patched_versions": "Fixed in Augeas 1.8.1, and backported to older versions in various distros",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of escaped strings in the `parse_name` function within `src/pathx.c`. Specifically, when a name ended in whitespace, the code incorrectly assumed it was always safe to trim that whitespace. This is not true if that whitespace is escaped, leading to incorrect parsing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
       "Improper handling of escaped strings"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could send maliciously crafted strings, causing an augeas-enabled application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vector": "Network (remote)",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send crafted strings to an application using Augeas.",
    "cvss_v3_metrics": {
        "attack_vector": "Network",
        "attack_complexity": "Low",
        "privileges_required": "None",
        "user_interaction": "None",

        "integrity": "High",
        "availability": "High",
        "base_score": 9.8
    },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in how Augeas parses path expressions. When an escaped whitespace character is present at the end of a name, the code incorrectly processes this, leading to reading beyond the end of the allocated buffer. This can cause a crash or, in some circumstances, arbitrary code execution."
