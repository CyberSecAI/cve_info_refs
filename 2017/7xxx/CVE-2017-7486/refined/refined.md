Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7486:

**1. Verification:**
The content explicitly mentions CVE-2017-7486: "pg\_user\_mappings view discloses foreign server passwords". This matches the official CVE description.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on the pg\_user\_mappings view. This view discloses information about user mappings to a foreign database, including potentially sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, to non-administrative database users.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Information Disclosure: The pg\_user\_mappings view exposes sensitive credentials used to connect to foreign databases.
- Inadequate Privilege Checks: The view does not properly restrict access to this information based on user privileges, allowing users with USAGE permission to obtain sensitive credentials.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who has USAGE privileges on the mapping could potentially:
- Obtain passwords used to connect to the foreign database
- Access resources on the remote database
- Perform arbitrary actions with those stolen credentials

**5. Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through SQL queries to the pg_user_mappings view.
- It can be exploited by database users with USAGE privileges on foreign server mappings.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated database user, and have USAGE privileges to a foreign server mapping.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in PostgreSQL versions 8.4 to 9.6, according to one of the bugzilla entries.
- The fix for CVE-2017-7486 involves restricting access to the pg\_user\_mappings view to properly match the restrictions of `information_schema.user_mapping_options` view, as stated in the commit message.
