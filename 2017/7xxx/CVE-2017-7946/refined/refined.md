The provided content relates to CVE-2017-7946.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `get_relocs_64()` function of the radare2 project's mach0 parser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free: The vulnerability occurs when memory allocated for relocation information is freed prematurely, and then accessed later, resulting in a crash or other unexpected behavior.
- The code allocated memory for `bin->dyld_info` with `malloc` and later with `calloc` without freeing the initial allocation when an error occured. This also constitutes a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to a crash of the radare2 application due to the use-after-free condition, as shown in the provided AddressSanitizer output.
- Arbitrary code execution might be possible, but the provided information does not confirm this.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by loading a crafted Mach-O file with a specific structure that causes the `get_relocs_64` function to free memory prematurely.
- The provided commit fixes both a NULL pointer dereference and use-after-free issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious Mach-O file to the radare2 application, either directly or through a vulnerable program that uses radare2.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, but is able to influence the input to the radare2 binary.
