# feh: Arbitrary remote code execution — GLSA **201707-08**

A vulnerability in feh might allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/feh** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.18.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.18.3** |

### Background

feh is an X11 image viewer aimed mostly at console users.

### Description

Tobias Stoeckmann discovered it was possible to trigger an
out-of-boundary heap write with the image viewer feh while receiving an
IPC message.

### Impact

A remote attacker, pretending to be the E17 window manager, could
possibly trigger an out-of-boundary heap write in feh while receiving an
IPC message. This could result in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All feh users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/feh-2.18.3"

```

Fix double-free/OOB-write while receiving IPC data

```
If a malicious client pretends to be the E17 window manager, it is
possible to trigger an out of boundary heap write while receiving an
IPC message.

The length of the already received message is stored in an unsigned
short, which overflows after receiving 64 KB of data. It's comparably
small amount of data and therefore achievable for an attacker.

When len overflows, realloc() will either be called with a small value
and therefore chars will be appended out of bounds, or len + 1 will be
exactly 0, in which case realloc() behaves like free(). This could be
abused for a later double-free attack as it's even possible to overwrite
the free information -- but this depends on the malloc implementation.
