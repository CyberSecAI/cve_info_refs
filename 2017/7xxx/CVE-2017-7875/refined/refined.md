Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7875:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds heap write vulnerability exists within the `feh` image viewer when handling IPC (Inter-Process Communication) messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The length of the received IPC message is stored in an `unsigned short`. This data type has a limited size, causing an overflow after receiving 64KB of data.
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Write:** When the length overflows, the `realloc()` function is called either with a small value which leads to out-of-bounds write, or `realloc()` is called with len+1 which leads to call `realloc(0)` and that is equivalent to `free()`.
- **Potential Double-Free:** If `realloc(0)` occurs, this can be potentially abused to cause a double-free condition, potentially corrupting heap metadata and leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By triggering the out-of-bounds write and potential double-free, a remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `feh` process.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **IPC Messaging:** The attacker sends specially crafted IPC messages to the `feh` process.
- **E17 Window Manager Impersonation:** The attacker pretends to be the E17 window manager, sending the malicious IPC message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the feh process, impersonating the E17 window manager.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same system, making this a remote attack vector.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in `src/wallpaper.c`, specifically in the `enl_ipc_get()` function.
- The length variable is an `unsigned short`, and after receiving 64KB of data, it will wrap around (overflow).

This analysis provides more technical details than the original CVE description, especially regarding the specific code location and mechanism of the heap overflow.
