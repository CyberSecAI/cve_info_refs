Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-7005:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple memory corruption issues in JavaScriptCore. Specifically, type confusion can occur after `JSGlobalObject::haveABadTime` is called.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to type confusion.
- When `JSGlobalObject::haveABadTime` is called, the type of all JavaScript arrays (including newly created arrays) within the same `JSGlobalObject` becomes `ArrayWithSlowPutArrayStorage`. This change affects objects that share the same `JSGlobalObject`, and can cause type confusions when arrays from another `JSGlobalObject` are used, because the new array will have the wrong type associated to it.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via specific Javascript calls, like fastSlice or arrayProtoPrivateFuncConcatMemcpy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unexpected application termination.
- Arbitrary code execution.
- Type confusion can lead to memory corruption and other unexpected behaviors.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing maliciously crafted web content.
- Exploiting JavaScript functions like `fastSlice` and `arrayProtoPrivateFuncConcatMemcpy` after triggering `haveABadTime`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to serve or inject malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable application (Safari or other application using JavaScriptCore)
- The attacker does not need to have access to the target's system beyond the ability to serve JavaScript.

**Affected products/versions:**
- iOS 10.3.2
- tvOS 10.2.1
- Safari 10.1.1 (OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, and macOS Sierra 10.12.5)

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The `haveABadTime` function modifies the array structure type within a JSGlobalObject.
- The type confusion is due to arrays from different JSGlobalObject interacting after one has had `haveABadTime` called on it.
- The provided PoC shows how to trigger a type confusion using `Array.prototype.slice` and `Array.prototype.concat`.

The information from the Exploit-DB entry provides more detailed technical context than the Apple security advisories alone.
