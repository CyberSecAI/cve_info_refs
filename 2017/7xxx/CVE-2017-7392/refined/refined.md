Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-7392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory leak in `SSecurityVeNCrypt.cxx` within the `SSecurityVeNCrypt::SSecurityVeNCrypt` function in TigerVNC 1.7.1.  The underlying ssecurity is not being properly deleted upon termination of VeNCrypt connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** When a VeNCrypt connection terminates, the associated memory is not released leading to a gradual accumulation of memory.
- **Resource exhaustion**: If an attacker makes repeated connection attempts, memory resources on the server can be consumed over time leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exhaust server memory over time by repeatedly sending connection requests to the Xvnc server, eventually causing a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Unauthenticated client**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending connection requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the TigerVNC server.
- No authentication is required, making it easier to exploit.
