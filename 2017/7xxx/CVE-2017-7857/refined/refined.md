{
  "vulnerability": "CVE-2017-7857",
  "affected_products": [
    "Oracle Fusion Middleware (Oracle Outside In Technology 8.5.4)"
  ],
  "root_cause": "A vulnerability exists in the FreeType library, which is used by Oracle Outside In Technology. Specifically, the issue lies in the handling of OpenType CFF (Type 2) fonts with variation data. A failure to properly prioritize CFF2 table over CFF table, leads to incorrect handling of variation fonts.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of font variations",
     "Incorrect logic in prioritizing CFF2 tables over CFF tables"
   ],
  "impact": "An attacker could craft a malicious font file and entice a user to open it, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process using FreeType.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Specially crafted font file"
  ],
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious font file and get a user to process it using a vulnerable version of FreeType.",
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of variation fonts within the `sfnt_init_face` function. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that when setting the number of instances to zero for CFF fonts, the code also verifies that no CFF2 table is present. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely."
