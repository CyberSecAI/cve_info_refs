#### [#CVE-2017-7760: File manipulation and privilege escalation via callback parameter in Mozilla Windows Updater and Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7760)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

#### [#CVE-2017-7765: Mark of the Web bypass when saving executable files](#CVE-2017-7765)

Reporter
Jonathan Birch and Microsoft Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1273265](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1273265)

#### [#CVE-2017-7766: File execution and privilege escalation through updater.ini, Mozilla Windows Updater, and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7766)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

An attack using manipulation of `updater.ini` contents, used by the Mozilla Windows Updater, and privilege escalation through the Mozilla Maintenance Service to allow for arbitrary file execution and deletion by the Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1342742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742)

#### [#CVE-2017-7767: Privilege escalation and arbitrary file overwrites through Mozilla Windows Updater and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7767)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to overwrite arbitrary files with junk data using the Mozilla Windows Updater, which runs with the Maintenance Service's privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1336964](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1336964)

#### [#CVE-2017-7768: 32 byte arbitrary file read through Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7768)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-5470: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 54 and Firefox ESR 52.2](#CVE-2017-5470)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Attached file
[proof-of-concept](attachment.cgi?id=8833966)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8833966&action=edit)

An unprivileged (standard) user can use the maintenance service to overwrite arbitrary files with junk data. There is no control over what is written to the target file, though the absence of the original data effectively "deletes" it.
For example, running the poc with clobber\_file.rb "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\updater.exe" will lock firefox to the current installed version until an administrator repairs the installation because the existing updater.exe cannot be loaded to be verified.
The root cause seems to be that if GetTempFileNameW in WriteStatusFailure [0] is called with a path like '\\.\c:\foo\clobbered', instead of returning a temporary file like '\\.\c:\foo\clobbered\svc123.tmp', it just returns the input path. WriteStatusFailure then directly writes to the temporary path [1], truncating it's contents with the results of the updater.
WriteStatusFailure can be called with a user-supplied directory in a few places, the easiest way is to put the target in the first argument and not supply enough further arguments to cause GetInstallationDir in ExecuteServiceCommand to fail [2]. This is how the attached clobber\_file.rb proof of concept works.
I haven't tested, but I think the calls in UpdaterIsValid would also be able to be purposely failed with an attacker controlled directory for update.status to get written into. Possibly some of the calls after that point as well, but it gets more difficult once the updater directory is verified as legitimate.
I also tested using hardlinks to redirect the update.status file while using a normal file path to trigger the overwrite - this does not seem to be possible as the maintenance service re-creates the file (which deletes the hardlink, rather than the file that is points to).
Tested on Windows 8.1 x64, Firefox 51.0.1 as well as mozilla-central.

Fairly certain that [bug 1342742](/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM using Updater to overwrite updater.ini") also fixes this bug.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |

| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Attached file
[poc + source.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8841306)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8841306&action=edit)

An unprivileged, standard, Windows user can execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM using the Firefox Updater (via the Maintenance Service).
This is possible by combining two bugs. The first is that the Updater can be tricked into executing an arbitrary PostUpdate file by the updater.ini file after a successful action is performed. The second allows overwrite of any file as SYSTEM with partially attacker controlled data.
We use the overwrite bug to write a new updater.ini, which triggers an install of Firefox into an attacker controlled directory which allows arbitrary code execution via the maintenanceservice\_installer.exe binary.
# Reproduction
I've attached a poc + source, to run it you'll need the full update.mar for the current installed version of Firefox [0] (or higher), as well as a full firefox installer [1]. The poc can be run as follows:
firefox\_poc.exe payload.exe firefox-51.0.1.complete.mar "Firefox Setup 51.0.1.exe" C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox
The payload.exe is the file to be executed as SYSTEM. The final argument needs to be a legitimate Firefox installation directory, and will default to C:\Program Files(x86)\Mozilla Firefox if not supplied. One of the bugs relies on a small race condition, which has always executed in less than a minute for me but let me know if you have any problems. It will continue trying until it succeeds or you use ctrl+c to kill it.
The included payload.exe just runs "whoami > /foo.txt", which should create a foo.txt file in your drive root with the contents "nt authority\system".
# ExeRelPath in updater.ini allows execution of arbitrary Mozilla binaries using absolute paths
The ExeRelPath entry in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\updater.ini file is executed by the updater after a successful action is made. There are allowances made to prevent directory traversal using '..', however if an absolute file path is provided instead of a filename then PathAppendSafe [2] (which uses PathAppendW) will return the absolute file path instead.
Eg. PathAppendW("C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox", "C:\some\mozilla.exe")
=> "C:\some\mozilla.exe"
The updater will happily execute this file, as long as it is signed by Mozilla with a current certificate. We can use then use these binaries in ways never intended to gain arbitrary code execution.
The avenue used in this proof of concept is to use the Firefox setup.exe to install Firefox into an attacker controlled directory [3], which then executes whatever is in the maintenanceservice\_installer.exe file on post-install (in fairness, this would have no practical chance of being intercepted otherwise). I imagine there are similar avenues in other Mozilla signed binaries, however I have not investigated them.
# Arbitrary file overwrite with partial content injection
Soon after the updater starts, updater.cpp [4] calls LogInit, which calls GetTempFileNameW with the attacker-supplied patch directory to get a temp filename for the log file. By providing a file which starts with \\.\, GetTempFileNameW will just copy the input into the output buffer instead of providing a valid temp directory.
Eg. GetTempFileNameW("\\.\c:\target\file.txt", L"log", 0, mTmpFilePath)
=> mTmpFilePath = "\\.\c:\target\file.txt"
Since it is essentially a normal file path, the log file will happily truncate and write to this file.
We can insert up to 260 characters at some point in the file using the fact that the working directory argument gets logged in updater.cpp [5]. The resulting file ends up looking something like the following (ABC's are user supplied):

The apply-to directory must be the same as or a child of the installation directory! Exiting.
In order to reach the line of code which logs the working directory argument, we need to first avoid a failure of WriteStatusFile [6], otherwise the updater will exit early and we will only truncate the file without our content written. The reason WriteStatusFile fails is that it tries to move a file to <patch-dir>/update.status, which in this case is \\.\c:\target\file.txt\update.status, which is not possible because file.txt is a file.
However, if we create a directory junction in an attacker controlled directory, eg. c:\exploit\junction\ pointing to c:\target\, then we can supply that to the updater instead. Now after the updater has opened a file descriptor to file.txt, we race it to switch the junction out with a directory named file.txt before it has attempted the status file move. If we win the race, the updater creates c:\exploit\junction\file.txt\update.status and execution continues.
# Arbitrary code execution
Because GetPrivateProfileStringW [7] isn't very picky about the formatting of the updater.ini, we can use the arbitrary file overwrite to replace the C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\updater.ini with one which looks like this:

ExeRelPath=C:\temp\ff-exploit\setup-dir\ff\_setup.exe
ExeArg=/INI=C:\temp\ff-exploit\setup-dir\ff\_setup.ini
The apply-to directory must be the same as or a child of the installation directory! Exiting.
The ff\_setup.ini has the InstallDirectoryPath entry set to an attacker controlled directory, eg. c:\temp\ff-exploit\new-firefox\ and the MaintenanceService entry set to true. The attacker just needs to copy their payload.exe into c:\temp\ff-exploit-new-firefox\maintenanceservice\_installer.exe and keep it locked for shared reads (so it can't be overwritten on install, but can be executed).
Then, we trigger some action which will succeed, like staging an upate.mar file
-> which will execute the PostUpdateWin command
-> which will install a new copy of firefox into the attacker controlled c:\temp\ff-exploit\new-firefox\ directory
-> which will then run the maintenanceservice\_install.exe payload as SYSTEM

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Didn't do a full review yet, but I do agree with the approach of just locking down \_all\_ the paths like this.
I'm a little worried about IsValidFullPath rejecting UNC paths; running off of a network share seems like a case we want to support (without requiring a drive mapping).
Also, this might be one of the things you're planning to add, but it's probably also a good idea to check the return code from GetTempFileName. Looks like it would have been returning 0 and setting last-error to 267 (directory name is invalid) while running this exploit.

No, you're right, I was misinterpreting that code somehow. Please disregard.
But that did lead me to discover another issue with using PathIsUNCServerShare this way; it only returns true if the path is just to a share, and false for a directory within a share:
PathIsUNCServerShareW(L"\\\\server\\share") == TRUE
PathIsUNCServerShareW(L"\\\\server\\share\\dir") == FALSE
So that's not all that useful in this context.Flags: needinfo?(mhowell)

Thanks for checking that call and this latest patch should cover it. Still have a few more calls I need to verify but that was the main one. I added a test for the failure case. I'm not sure if it would be ok to add an in tree test using a valid UNC server share path since tests that access the network aren't allowed. Perhaps it would be ok if I used a server name that wouldn't be used since from what I recall the concern is that tests should pass without access to the network resource which this test would.
Added the GetTempFileName checks for the cases that are of concern. I still need to double check if there are other cases.
The main last thing I want to add is checking that the registry entry for the install directory exists from the maintenance service but there might be a few more as I examine the code.
Thanks for the feedback!

Drivers, keeping the existing tests running while adding the new restrictions is taking a little longer than I had thought it would. Another day or so and it should be ready to land on nightly.

I filed [bug 1353889](/show_bug.cgi?id=1353889 "RESOLVED FIXED - Grant write access to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla for the account running tests on Windows test systems") which should make it possible to add tests for the one change that I didn't add a test for. I manually verified that change worked as expected. There are some other things that can be done to simplify the tests overall after the changes to TestAUSHelper but I don't want to do that in this bug.

Still need to fix this call; PathIsUNCServerShare rejects anything not of the precise form "\\server\share" (including "\\server\share\" it turns out), but we need to allow subdirectories of a share.

Disregard this comment; I didn't notice we were calling PathIsUNCServerShare on the result of PathStripToRoot.

This isn't needed since the file is written to the patch directory which must exist.

patch rev2
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The steps to reproduce this are fairly complicated (see [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM using Updater to overwrite updater.ini")) so in my opinion it wouldn't be that easy,
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think it paints a bulls-eye on the security problem though the checks do give a starting point on what to go after.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
It should be fairly simple and no more risky than this patch.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
As with all significant app update patches I definitely want this to bake on Nightly for a couple of days. Also, if it is ok with you I'd like to land this on the oak branch and test it before landing it on Nightly.

[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
Original maintenance service implementation

I have verified it on Nightly
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
No
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
N/A
[Is the change risky?]:
No more so than any other similar change to app update.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
It validates the command line arguments used with the updater are what should be sent by Firefox. It is possible though not likely that some system might somehow munge the arguments.

String or UUID changes made by this patch:
None
I have also built esr52 with this patch and all update tests pass.
See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process> for more info.

A local privilege escalation like this is more relevant to enterprise users than typical home users, and thus appropriate for ESR.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
