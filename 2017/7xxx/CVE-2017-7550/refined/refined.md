{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `jenkins_plugin` module in Ansible allowed arbitrary arguments to be passed via the `params` parameter. This bypasses the `no_log` setting for sensitive information such as passwords, causing them to be logged on the remote host.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Information exposure through logs",
       "Bypassing intended security controls (no_log)"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive information (passwords) in remote host logs. A low-privileged user on the remote host could potentially gain access to Jenkins instances by obtaining these passwords from the logs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker exploits the moduleâ€™s params argument to pass password",
       "The attacker then gains access to the remote system logs"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to run Ansible playbooks",
      "Access to the remote host's logs"
    ],
     "additional_information": "The module documentation also incorrectly advised users to use the params argument to specify passwords, contributing to the vulnerability. The fix involves removing the `params` argument and explicitly specifying accepted parameters. The documentation was also updated to use url_password parameter."
