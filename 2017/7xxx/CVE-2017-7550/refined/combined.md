# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

##### ISSUE TYPE

* Bug Report

##### COMPONENT NAME

lib/ansible/modules/web\_infrastructure/jenkins\_plugin.py

##### ANSIBLE VERSION

```
devel 2.4 2.3

```
##### CONFIGURATION

N/A

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT

N/A

##### SUMMARY

It was noticed that using the jenkins\_plugin with username and password would log the password on the remote host. After some digging I discovered that in addition to the normal url\_username and url\_password arguments for fetch\_url() the jenkins\_plugin module also has a params argument where arbitrary ansible module arguments can be given. This parameter should go away as it circumvents all the normal argument checking, validation, and normalization.

For url\_password, this is bad as using param to send in the url\_password instead of the specific url\_password argument allows the url\_password to be logged. This can be a security problem.

I also found the source of the user's use of param instead of url\_username and url\_password: the module documentation has an example of using param that has that in it.

##### STEPS TO FIX

* I am going to immediately create and merge a PR to remove the param example and replace it with using the url\_username and url\_password arguments directly.
* The params argument should also be removed (as it bypasses the no\_log setting on url\_password, allowing the password to be logged by mistake). Additional parameters that the module uses should be explicitly stated in the argument\_spec instead. (I took a look at the module and it does not appear that params is passed directly to the jenkins server, instead, specific keys are always plucked out of the params. So there should be no problem removing params.)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1473645#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-21 11:30:44 UTC  ``` It was discovered that jenkins_plugin module in Ansible exposes passwords with the params attribute in the system logs of the remote host. Low privileged user on remote host can access the logs and is able to log into Jenkins instance as administrator.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1473645#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-07-21 11:30:57 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Stefano Mazzucco (Kirontech)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1473645#c7)  Borja Tarraso    2017-09-25 14:55:36 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1495237](show_bug.cgi?id=1495237 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-7550 ansible: jenkins_plugin module exposes passwords in remote host logs [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1495236](show_bug.cgi?id=1495236 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-7550 ansible: jenkins_plugin module exposes passwords in remote host logs [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1473645#c8)  Toshio Kuratomi    2017-09-25 19:39:01 UTC  ``` I took a look at this bug upstream and filed: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/30874>  It looks to be mostly a documentation bug.  The jenkins_plugin is a community written plugin.  It logs into a jenkins server to manage plugins installed there.  The plugin has the standard argument, url_password in order to authenticate to the jenkins server.  It also has a non-standard, params argument.  The params argument takes a free-form dict of values and then override the normal module params with those arguments.  This may have been added during development and then in module review mistaken as a set of arbitrary params that had to be passed to the jenkins server rather than being a supplement to the ansible module arguments.  I've requested that the community maintainer of the module remove the params argument in the upstream bug report.  The documentation issue is that the module's documentation tells users to use the params to pass url_password into the module.  Doing this bypasses the module's setting of no_log on the url_password.  Instead, the module should document setting url_password via the proper url_password field.  If the user use's the actual url_password argument then the password should be properly hidden.  I'll change the documentation immediately for our next upstream release.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1473645#c9)  Toshio Kuratomi    2017-09-26 01:40:09 UTC  ``` I went a little further in the PR I eventually merged upstream: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/30875>  In addition to changing the documentation, the PR prevents the user from specifying url_password in the param argument (an error is raised if the user attempts to do so.)  The PR has been applied in the 2.3.x, 2.4.x, and devel branches.  If there's another release for 2.3.x, this change will be in 2.3.3.  It will be in 2.4.1 (out in about a month).  It will be in 2.5.0 (~4 months from now).  If you want to apply the patch now, the changes in that PR applied cleanly on all of the branches.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1473645#c12)  Martin Prpič    2017-10-19 10:34:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat OpenStack Platform will no longer be updating the Ansible package in:   * Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 (Newton) * Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 (Ocata)  As of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4, customers can consume an updated Ansible package directly from the extras-rhel-7.4 channel.

# [Ansible 2.4 Porting Guide](#id1)[](#ansible-2-4-porting-guide "Link to this heading")

This section discusses the behavioral changes between Ansible 2.3 and Ansible 2.4.

It is intended to assist in updating your playbooks, plugins and other parts of your Ansible infrastructure so they will work with this version of Ansible.

We suggest you read this page along with [Ansible Changelog for 2.4](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.4/CHANGELOG.md) to understand what updates you may need to make.

This document is part of a collection on porting. The complete list of porting guides can be found at [porting guides](porting_guides.html#porting-guides).

## [Python version](#id2)[](#python-version "Link to this heading")

Ansible will not support Python 2.4 or 2.5 on the target hosts anymore. Going forward, Python 2.6+ will be required on targets, as already is the case on the controller.

## [Inventory](#id3)[](#inventory "Link to this heading")

Inventory has been refactored to be implemented through plugins and now allows for multiple sources. This change is mostly transparent to users.

One exception is the `inventory_dir`, which is now a host variable; previously it could only have one value so it was set globally.
This means you can no longer use it early in plays to determine `hosts:` or similar keywords.
This also changes the behaviour of `add_hosts` and the implicit localhost;
because they no longer automatically inherit the global value, they default to `None`. See the module documentation for more information.

The `inventory_file` remains mostly unchanged, as it was always host specific.

Since there is no longer a single inventory, the ‘implicit localhost’ doesn’t get either of these variables defined.

A bug was fixed with the inventory path/directory, which was defaulting to the current working directory. This caused `group_vars` and `host_vars` to be picked up from the current working directory instead of just adjacent to the playbook or inventory directory when a host list (comma separated host names) was provided as inventory.

### [Initial playbook relative group\_vars and host\_vars](#id4)[](#initial-playbook-relative-group-vars-and-host-vars "Link to this heading")

In Ansible versions prior to 2.4, the inventory system would maintain the context of the initial playbook that was executed. This allowed successively included playbooks from other directories to inherit group\_vars and host\_vars placed relative to the top level playbook file.

Due to some behavioral inconsistencies, this functionality will not be included in the new
inventory system starting with Ansible version 2.4.

Similar functionality can still be achieved by using vars\_files, include\_vars, or group\_vars and host\_vars placed relative to the inventory file.

## [Deprecated](#id5)[](#deprecated "Link to this heading")

### [Specifying Inventory sources](#id6)[](#specifying-inventory-sources "Link to this heading")

Use of `--inventory-file` on the command line is now deprecated. Use `--inventory` or `-i`.
The associated ini configuration key, `hostfile`, and environment variable, `ANSIBLE_HOSTS`,
are also deprecated. Replace them with the configuration key `inventory` and environment variable [`ANSIBLE_INVENTORY`](../reference_appendices/config.html#envvar-ANSIBLE_INVENTORY).

### [Use of multiple tags](#id7)[](#use-of-multiple-tags "Link to this heading")

Specifying `--tags` (or `--skip-tags`) multiple times on the command line currently leads to the last one overriding all the previous ones. This behavior is deprecated. In the future, if you specify –tags multiple times the tags will be merged together. From now on, using `--tags` multiple times on one command line will emit a deprecation warning. Setting the `merge_multiple_cli_tags` option to True in the `ansible.cfg` file will enable the new behavior.

In 2.4, the default has change to merge the tags. You can enable the old overwriting behavior through the config option.

In 2.5, multiple `--tags` options will be merged with no way to go back to the old behavior.

### [Other caveats](#id8)[](#other-caveats "Link to this heading")

No major changes in this version.

## [Modules](#id9)[](#modules "Link to this heading")

Major changes in popular modules are detailed here

* The [win\_shell](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/win_shell_module.html#win-shell-module "(in Ansible v2.9)") and [win\_command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/win_command_module.html#win-command-module "(in Ansible v2.9)") modules now properly preserve quoted arguments in the command-line. Tasks that attempted to work around the issue by adding extra quotes/escaping may need to be reworked to remove the superfluous escaping. See [Issue 23019](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/23019) for additional detail.

### [Modules removed](#id10)[](#modules-removed "Link to this heading")

The following modules no longer exist:

* None

### [Deprecation notices](#id11)[](#deprecation-notices "Link to this heading")

The following modules will be removed in Ansible 2.8. Please update your playbooks accordingly.

* azure, use [azure\_rm\_virtualmachine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/azure_rm_virtualmachine_module.html#azure-rm-virtualmachine-module "(in Ansible v2.9)"), which uses the new Resource Manager SDK.
* win\_msi, use [win\_package](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/win_package_module.html#win-package-module "(in Ansible v2.9)") instead

### [Noteworthy module changes](#id12)[](#noteworthy-module-changes "Link to this heading")

* The [win\_get\_url](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/win_get_url_module.html#win-get-url-module "(in Ansible v2.9)") module has the dictionary `win_get_url` in its results deprecated, its content is now also available directly in the resulting output, like other modules. This dictionary will be removed in Ansible 2.8.
* The [win\_unzip](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/win_unzip_module.html#win-unzip-module "(in Ansible v2.9)") module no longer includes the dictionary `win_unzip` in its results; the contents are now included directly in the resulting output, like other modules.
* The [win\_package](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/win_package_module.html#win-package-module "(in Ansible v2.9)") module return values `exit_code` and `restart_required` have been deprecated in favor of `rc` and `reboot_required` respectively. The deprecated return values will be removed in Ansible 2.6.

## [Plugins](#id13)[](#plugins "Link to this heading")

A new way to configure and document plugins has been introduced. This does not require changes to existing setups but developers should start adapting to the new infrastructure now. More details will be available in the developer documentation for each plugin type.

### [Vars plugin changes](#id14)[](#vars-plugin-changes "Link to this heading")

There have been many changes to the implementation of vars plugins, but both users and developers should not need to change anything to keep current setups working. Developers should consider changing their plugins take advantage of new features.

The most notable difference to users is that vars plugins now get invoked on demand instead of at inventory build time. This should make them more efficient for large inventories, especially when using a subset of the hosts.

Note

* This also creates a difference with group/host\_vars when using them adjacent to playbooks. Before, the ‘first’ playbook loaded determined the variables; now the ‘current’ playbook does. We are looking to fix this soon, since ‘all playbooks’ in the path should be considered for variable loading.
* In 2.4.1 we added a toggle to allow you to control this behaviour, ‘top’ will be the pre 2.4, ‘bottom’ will use the current playbook hosting the task and ‘all’ will use them all from top to bottom.

### [Inventory plugins](#id15)[](#inventory-plugins "Link to this heading")

Developers should start migrating from hardcoded inventory with dynamic inventory scripts to the new Inventory Plugins. The scripts will still work through the `script` inventory plugin but Ansible development efforts will now concentrate on writing plugins rather than enhancing existing scripts.

Both users and developers should look into the new plugins because they are intended to alleviate the need for many of the hacks and workarounds found in the dynamic inventory scripts.

### [Callback plugins](#id16)[](#callback-plugins "Link to this heading")

Users:

* Callbacks are now using the new configuration system. Users should not need to change anything as the old system still works,
  but you might see a deprecation notice if any callbacks used are not inheriting from the built in classes. Developers need to update them as stated below.

Developers:

* If your callback does not inherit from `CallbackBase` (directly or indirectly through another callback), it will still work, but issue a deprecation notice.
  To avoid this and ensure it works in the future change it to inherit from `CallbackBase` so it has the new options handling methods and properties.
  You can also implement the new options handling methods and properties but that won’t automatically inherit changes added in the future. You can look at `CallbackBase` itself and/or `AnsiblePlugin` for details.
* Any callbacks inheriting from other callbacks might need to also be updated to contain the same documented options
  as the parent or the options won’t be available. This is noted in the developer guide.

### [Template lookup plugin: Escaping Strings](#id17)[](#template-lookup-plugin-escaping-strings "Link to this heading")

Prior to Ansible 2.4, backslashes in strings passed to the template lookup plugin would be escaped
automatically. In 2.4, users are responsible for escaping backslashes themselves. This change
brings the template lookup plugin inline with the template module so that the same backslash
escaping rules apply to both.

If you have a template lookup like this:

```
- debug:
    msg: '{{ lookup("template", "template.j2") }}'

```

**OLD** In Ansible 2.3 (and earlier) `template.j2` would look like this:

```
{{ "name surname" | regex_replace("^[^\s]+\s+(.*)", "\1") }}

```

**NEW** In Ansible 2.4 it should be changed to look like this:

```
{{ "name surname" | regex_replace("^[^\\s]+\\s+(.*)", "\\1") }}

```

## [Tests](#id18)[](#tests "Link to this heading")

### [Tests succeeded/failed](#id19)[](#tests-succeeded-failed "Link to this heading")

Prior to Ansible version 2.4, a task return code of `rc` would override a return code of `failed`. In version 2.4, both `rc` and `failed` are used to calculate the state of the task. Because of this, test plugins `succeeded`/`failed`` have also been changed. This means that overriding a task failure with `failed_when: no` will result in `succeeded`/`failed` returning `True`/`False`. For example:

```
- command: /bin/false
  register: result
  failed_when: no

- debug:
    msg: 'This is printed on 2.3'
  when: result|failed

- debug:
    msg: 'This is printed on 2.4'
  when: result|succeeded

- debug:
    msg: 'This is always printed'
  when: result.rc != 0

```

As we can see from the example above, in Ansible 2.3 `succeeded`/`failed` only checked the value of `rc`.

## [Networking](#id20)[](#networking "Link to this heading")

There have been a number of changes to how Networking Modules operate.

Playbooks should still use `connection: local`.

### [Persistent Connection](#id21)[](#persistent-connection "Link to this heading")

The configuration variables `connection_retries` and `connect_interval` which were added in Ansible 2.3 are now deprecated. For Ansible 2.4 and later use `connection_retry_timeout`.

To control timeouts use `command_timeout` rather than the previous top level `timeout` variable under `[default]`

See [Ansible Network debug guide](../network/user_guide/network_debug_troubleshooting.html#network-debug-troubleshooting) for more information.

## [Configuration](#id22)[](#configuration "Link to this heading")

The configuration system has had some major changes. Users should be unaffected except for the following:

* All relative paths defined are relative to the ansible.cfg file itself. Previously they varied by setting. The new behavior should be more predictable.
* A new macro `{{CWD}}` is available for paths, which will make paths relative to the ‘current working directory’,
  this is unsafe but some users really want to rely on this behaviour.

Developers that were working directly with the previous API should revisit their usage as some methods (for example, `get_config`) were kept for backwards compatibility but will warn users that the function has been deprecated.

The new configuration has been designed to minimize the need for code changes in core for new plugins. The plugins just need to document their settings and the configuration system will use the documentation to provide what they need. This is still a work in progress; currently only ‘callback’ and ‘connection’ plugins support this. More details will be added to the specific plugin developer guides.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2966)

## Topic

An update for ansible is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote-task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

The ansible packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.4.0, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. For more information, please see the Ansible 2.4 Porting Guide linked in the References section. (BZ#1492477)

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way Ansible passed certain parameters to the jenkins\_plugin module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to expose sensitive information from a remote host's logs. This flaw was fixed by not allowing passwords to be specified in the "params" argument, and noting this in the module documentation. (CVE-2017-7550)

Red Hat would like to thank Stefano Mazzucco (Kirontech) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* A bug in the SELinux module, which caused a corruption of the SELinux configuration file, has been fixed.
* Previously, some of the functionality of Ansible (the json\_query filter) was unavailable, because the dependency on the python2-jmespath package was missing. Now, the missing dependency has been added. (BZ#1484910)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products
