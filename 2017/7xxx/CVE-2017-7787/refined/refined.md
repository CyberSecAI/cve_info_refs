Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7787:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2017-7787 is relevant. Multiple sources explicitly mention the CVE ID and its associated vulnerability, described as a same-origin policy bypass involving iframes and page reloads, potentially leading to information disclosure.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Firefox handles session history during simultaneous reloads and fragment navigations with dynamically added iframes.  Specifically:
    *   The `mLSHE` (most recent session history entry) and `mOSHE` (original session history entry) of the docshell can become out of sync.
    *  A reload operation sets `mLSHE`. Then a fragment navigation occurs updating the session history to point to it, but not `mLSHE` or `mOSHE`. When the reload completes, `mOSHE` points to the reloaded entry and the history to the fragment entry, and as dynamic entries get cleared the fragment entry has an incomplete history. The next reload then uses the URL from the `mOSHE`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The core vulnerability is a bypass of the same-origin policy, allowing a cross-domain iframe to access content from the top-level page after a specific sequence of reloads and navigations.
    *   **Incorrect Session History Handling:** The root cause is related to the incorrect synchronization of session history entries (`mLSHE` and `mOSHE`) during specific page load scenarios.
    *   **Scope violation:** iframes can break out of scope.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive data from the top-level page to a malicious iframe.
    *   **User information theft:** A malicious third-party advert could steal user information through the iframe.
    *   **Cross-domain access:** A cross-domain iframe can access autofill usernames.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves a combination of:
        *   A page with an embedded iframe from a different origin.
        *   JavaScript code within the iframe that dynamically creates and modifies other iframes.
        *   Triggering a page reload using `location.reload()` or a link that calls location.reload()
        *   Simultaneous fragment navigation which is triggered while a page reload operation is in progress.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to control an iframe:** The attacker needs to be able to control the contents of an iframe embedded within a vulnerable page, such as through cross-site scripting (XSS) or through malicious advertising networks.
    *   **Ability to trigger page reload:** The attacker needs a means to trigger a page reload after the iframe is loaded with their malicious content.
    *   **Timing:** The attacker must time the navigation to coincide with the ongoing reload.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the interaction between `SHistory`, `mLSHE` and `mOSHE` in `DocShell` object.
*   The patch synchronizes the `SHistory` entry with the `mLSHE` to resolve the issue, avoiding the confusion where `mOSHE` points to a reloaded entry and `shistory` to a fragment entry.
*   The fix was implemented in the `OnNewURI` function, so the patch also applies to esr52 branches.
*   The patch was considered to be risky, since it is related to session history changes, but was considered safe for trunk and ESR52.

**4. Red Hat Specific Information:**

*   Red Hat assigned CVE-2017-7787 to this issue and issued security advisories (RHSA-2017:2456, RHSA-2017:2534) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.
*   The security impact was rated as "Important" by Red Hat.
*   Red Hat's fix involved upgrading Thunderbird to version 52.3.0.

**5. Mozilla Specific Information:**

*   The bug was initially reported by Oliver Wagner.
*   The fix was first implemented in Firefox 55.
*   The fix was then backported to Firefox ESR 52.3.

**6. Gentoo Specific Information:**

*   Gentoo issued GLSA 201803-14 to address multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-7787, in Mozilla Thunderbird.

**7. Debian Specific Information:**

*   Debian issued DSA-3928-1 for Firefox ESR and DSA-3968-1 for Thunderbird to address these vulnerabilities.

**Summary of Impact:**

CVE-2017-7787 allows a malicious cross-origin iframe to gain unauthorized access to data within the top-level window by exploiting an inconsistency in session history handling during reloads. The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating iframes and initiating a reload. This can potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure and is considered a high severity security flaw. The vulnerability was present in Firefox and Thunderbird and was addressed in subsequent updates of these products.
