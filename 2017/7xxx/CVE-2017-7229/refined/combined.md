### Secure identities.

Seamlessly secure identities throughout the cycle of accessing any resource across any infrastructure, including hybrid, SaaS and multi-cloud. The CyberArk identity security platform is the first line of defense against malicious actors and unauthorized access to protect what matters most.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-1.svg)

#### Seamless & secure access for all identities

By combining secure SSO, Adaptive MFA, Lifecycle Management, Directory Services and User Behavior Analytics, we help you streamline operations and give users simple and secure access to resources—on-premises, cloud, hybrid—from any location, using any device.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-2.svg)

#### Intelligent privilege controls

Apply world-class intelligent privilege controls across the IT estate, as well as differentiated controls to secure the unique needs of workforce users, third-party vendors, endpoints and machine identities as they access sensitive data.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-3.svg)

#### Flexible identity automation & orchestration

Streamline HR processes, ensure users have the right access to the right resources, enable compliance with industry or government regulations, and improve efficiencies across the board with orchestration and lifecycle management, permissions and entitlements, and directory and federation services.

### Identity Security Defined

Centered on intelligent privilege controls, identity security seamlessly secures access for all identities and flexibly automates the identity lifecycle with continuous threat detection and prevention — all with a unified approach.

## Apply intelligent privilege controls across the entire identity lifecycle

##### Expand intelligent privilege controls that were designed for the most privileged user, such as an admin, to a broader range of human and machine identities, whenever standing or just-in-time access is required.

[![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/card-icon-1.svg)

#### Workforce & Customer Access

Ensure that the right users have secure access to the right resources at the right times, by protecting workforce and customer credentials and tightly controlling access to on-premises and cloud-based applications, services and IT infrastructure.

#### Endpoint Privilege Security

Take control over unmanaged privilege on the endpoints to significantly reduce the area of attack and defend from threats by removing local admin rights, enforcing role-specific least privilege and improving audit-readiness.

### Secure identities.

Seamlessly secure identities throughout the cycle of accessing any resource across any infrastructure, including hybrid, SaaS and multi-cloud. The CyberArk identity security platform is the first line of defense against malicious actors and unauthorized access to protect what matters most.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-1.svg)

#### Seamless & secure access for all identities

By combining secure SSO, Adaptive MFA, Lifecycle Management, Directory Services and User Behavior Analytics, we help you streamline operations and give users simple and secure access to resources—on-premises, cloud, hybrid—from any location, using any device.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-2.svg)

#### Intelligent privilege controls

Apply world-class intelligent privilege controls across the IT estate, as well as differentiated controls to secure the unique needs of workforce users, third-party vendors, endpoints and machine identities as they access sensitive data.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-3.svg)

#### Flexible identity automation & orchestration

Streamline HR processes, ensure users have the right access to the right resources, enable compliance with industry or government regulations, and improve efficiencies across the board with orchestration and lifecycle management, permissions and entitlements, and directory and federation services.

### Identity Security Defined

Centered on intelligent privilege controls, identity security seamlessly secures access for all identities and flexibly automates the identity lifecycle with continuous threat detection and prevention — all with a unified approach.

## Apply intelligent privilege controls across the entire identity lifecycle

##### Expand intelligent privilege controls that were designed for the most privileged user, such as an admin, to a broader range of human and machine identities, whenever standing or just-in-time access is required.

[![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/card-icon-1.svg)

#### Workforce & Customer Access

Ensure that the right users have secure access to the right resources at the right times, by protecting workforce and customer credentials and tightly controlling access to on-premises and cloud-based applications, services and IT infrastructure.

#### Endpoint Privilege Security

Take control over unmanaged privilege on the endpoints to significantly reduce the area of attack and defend from threats by removing local admin rights, enforcing role-specific least privilege and improving audit-readiness.

A description of 2017-7229: Vaultive O365 Content-Type Mangling

 [Raw](/dkg/a1998c861bf2430e0d01d586905b11cb/raw/2c9f86f293f8e734fa901bbeae0e0189a0b05a04/CVE-2017-7229.md)

[**CVE-2017-7229.md**](#file-cve-2017-7229-md)

# CVE-2017-7299

## Vaultive O365 Content-Type Mangling

PGP/MIME encrypted messages injected into a [Vaultive O365](https://vaultive.com/for-your-technology/office-365-security/) frontend via
IMAP or SMTP have their Content-Type changed from:

```
Content-Type: multipart/encrypted; protocol="application/pgp-encrypted"; boundary="abc123abc123"

```

to:

```
Content-Type: text/plain

```

This results in the encrypted message being structured in such a way
that most PGP/MIME-capable mail user agents are unable to decrypt it
cleanly.

The outcome is that encrypted mail passing through this device does
not work (Denial of Service), and a common real-world consequence is a
request to send re-send the mail in the clear (Information Disclosure).

## Additional Information

Vaultive has acknowledged the issue and fixed this in version 4.5.21

## Vulnerability Type

[CWE-222](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/222.html): Truncation of Security-relevant Information

## Vendor of Product

Vaultive

## Affected Product Code Base

[Vaultive Office 365 Security](https://vaultive.com/for-your-technology/office-365-security/) - version 4.5.19

## Affected Component

IMAP and SMTP interfaces to Vaultive O365 Security (other interfaces untested)

## Impact

* Denial of Service
* Information Disclosure

## Attack Vectors

The vulnerability is triggered by anyone sending PGP/MIME encrypted mail through a Vaultive appliance

## Discoverer

Daniel Kahn Gillmor, ACLU
