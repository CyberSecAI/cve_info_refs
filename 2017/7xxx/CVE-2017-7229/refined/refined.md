Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of the `Content-Type` header in PGP/MIME encrypted messages by Vaultive O365 Security when messages are ingested via IMAP or SMTP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Content-Type Mangling:** The `Content-Type` header of PGP/MIME encrypted messages is changed from `multipart/encrypted` to `text/plain`. This alteration corrupts the structure of the encrypted message, making it unreadable by most PGP/MIME-capable mail clients.
- **Truncation of Security-Relevant Information (CWE-222):**  The modification of the `Content-Type` header effectively truncates or invalidates the security-relevant structure of the encrypted message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Encrypted emails cannot be decrypted by recipients, effectively disrupting communication. This is a denial of service as the intended secure communication channel is broken.
-   **Information Disclosure:**  Due to the DoS, users might request the sender to resend the email in clear text to ensure delivery. This could lead to unintended information disclosure as sensitive information that should have been encrypted is now sent in an insecure manner.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Email Ingestion:** The vulnerability is triggered when any user sends a PGP/MIME encrypted email through the Vaultive appliance using IMAP or SMTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **No special privileges required:** Any user capable of sending PGP/MIME encrypted email can trigger the vulnerability by sending an email to a recipient using a Vaultive appliance.

**Additional Information:**

-   **Vendor:** Vaultive.
-   **Affected Product:** Vaultive Office 365 Security (version 4.5.19).
-   **Affected Components:** IMAP and SMTP interfaces of the Vaultive appliance.
-   **Fixed Version:** The issue was acknowledged and fixed in Vaultive O365 Security version 4.5.21.
-   **Discoverer:** Daniel Kahn Gillmor, ACLU.
