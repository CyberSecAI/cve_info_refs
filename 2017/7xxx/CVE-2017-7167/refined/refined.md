- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow in ld64 (likely the linker component of Xcode).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with user privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Compiling with untrusted sources, such as malicious code embedded in a project being compiled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide or influence the source code that is compiled using Xcode 9.2.
