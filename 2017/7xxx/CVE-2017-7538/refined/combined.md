| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1477667#c0)  Jan Dobes    2017-08-02 15:18:00 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When cdn-sync is run with --no-packages, all existing packages in given channel(s) are disassociated. --no-packages should mean only to skip relevant stage during sync.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): spacewalk-backend-2.5.3-144  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. fully sync some channel using cdn-sync 2. run cdn-sync (for given channel) again with --no-packages option  Actual results: All packages are gone from channel.  Expected results: Packages will stay in channel.  Additional info: Running cdn-sync again without --no-packages option will link all packages back to channel unless cdn-sync --clear-cache is executed in the meantime.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1477667#c1)  Jan Dobes    2017-08-02 16:24:27 UTC  ``` fix in spacewalk.git(master):  47a9c1e26c0bcbcc12ea3a307a128cb399b07b7d   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1477667#c5)  Radovan Drazny    2017-08-25 09:20:59 UTC  ``` Re-verified with spacewalk-backend-2.5.3-151.el6sat.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1477667#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-06 12:27:53 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2645)

## Topic

An update for satellite-schema, spacewalk-backend, spacewalk-java, and spacewalk-schema is now available for Red Hat Satellite 5.8 and Red Hat Satellite 5.8 ELS.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Spacewalk is an Open Source systems management solution that provides system provisioning, configuration and patching capabilities.

Red Hat Satellite is a system management tool for Linux-based infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and the remote management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.

Security Fix(es):

* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in how an organization name is displayed in Satellite 5. A user able to change an organization's name could exploit this flaw to perform XSS attacks against other Satellite users. (CVE-2017-7538)

This issue was discovered by Ales Dujicek (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* Prior to this update, transferring content between Satellites using Inter-Satellite Synchronization or channel-dumps failed to transfer the product-name related to channels. This interfered with the process of moving a server between EUS channels. The 'satellite-export' tool now correctly provides associated product-names, fixing this behavior. (BZ#1446271)
* Prior to this update, the API call 'schedule.failSystemAction()' allowed overwriting a system's event history. This is undesirable from an auditing standpoint. The API now no longer allows affecting completed or failed events. (BZ#1455887)
* Prior to this update, organization administrators who were not allowed to change their organization's attributes could do so by modifying form elements. The associated form controller no longer allows this behavior. (BZ#1458722)
* Prior to this update, the 'download' tool's retry limit would be incorrect if there were more available mirrors than its retry count. It could also produce a harmless but unhelpful traceback in some situations. Both of these behaviors have been fixed. (BZ#1458765)
* Prior to this update, it was possible for parallel registrations using reactivation keys, that were creating snapshot entries, to occasionally deadlock. Both the reactivation-key registration and snapshot-creation paths have been updated to prevent these deadlocks. (BZ#1458880)
* Prior to this update, if there was some problem with a single erratum in a given repository, the 'reposync' command would complain and exit. The tool now logs such errors but continues to synchronize any remaining errata. (BZ#1466229)
* The Satellite 5.8 release failed to include an update to a registration-failure error message that had been released for Satellite 5.7. This restores the missing update. (BZ#1467632)
* Prior to this update, the list of systems in the System Set Manager failed to display the correct icons for a system's update status. This has been corrected. (BZ#1475067)
* Prior to this update, a timing window in the 'cdn-sync' command, when synchronizing multiple channels at once, could cause some of the synchronization attempts to be refused with a 403 error. This update fixes the timing window so that multiple syncs should now work reliably. (BZ#1476924)
* Prior to this update, attempting to view the systems in the System Set Manager that are affected by a given erratum would result in an internal server error. This has been fixed. (BZ#1477508)
* Prior to this update, using 'cdn-sync --no-packages' on a specific channel would disassociate all packages from that channel. This behavior has been fixed, so that '--no-packages' now just skips that step as intended. (BZ#1477667)

## Solution

Application of this errata involves updating the database schema.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata relevant to your system have been applied. To apply this erratum, take the following steps:

* Shut down Red Hat Satellite by running the following command as root:

rhn-satellite stop

* Backup the database. For embedded or managed database variants, please consult Red Hat Satellite 5.8 documentation. For an external database, consult your database administrator.
* Upgrade the errata packages. Details on how to apply this update are available at <https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>
* Update the database schema using the spacewalk-schema-upgrade command. To do so, run as root:

spacewalk-schema-upgrade

This process will update your database schema to the latest version. The
spacewalk-schema-upgrade command will inform you about the results of the
upgrade and exact locations of schema upgrade log files.

* Restart Red Hat Satellite by running the following as root:

rhn-satellite start

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067#c0)  Ricardo Santamaria    2017-07-26 00:58:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Icons under Updates section in System Set Manager not displayed  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  Satellite 5.8.0.31-1.el6sat RHEL 6.9  Steps to Reproduce:  > "Manage" button    > "Systems" tab  Actual results: When using SSM to manage group of systems in Satellite 5.8 the updates column is empty.   Expected results: Like Satellite 5.6 and 5.7 expect the systems to show the icon under updates  column.   Additional info: When looking at a group with SSM icons appears:   > "Systems" tab     > "Systems Groups"        > Select system group         > Select "Systems" tab of list systems   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067#c2)  Grant Gainey    2017-07-28 20:33:23 UTC  ``` spacewalk.github: b1098d9f6878875b57ff8ce3ede4224c206a2ffc   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067#c5)  Lukáš Hellebrandt    2017-08-17 12:16:53 UTC  ``` Verified with spacewalk-java-2.5.14-91.  The Updates column now indeed shows an icon indicating the update status. Also, group view of systems has not been broken by the fix.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067#c7)  Grant Gainey    2017-08-22 11:54:40 UTC  ``` Looks like this is a problem in more than one place:  === Ales Dujicek 2017-08-22 03:54:52 EDT Description of problem:  similar to [bz1475067](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067 "CLOSED ERRATA - Icons under Updates section in System Set Manager not displayed")  Updates icons are not displayed on page /rhn/systems/ssm/ErrataSystemsAffected.do?eid=16   How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. SSM -> Errata tab -> click on number in column 'Affected' 2. empty column 'Updates' ===  Reopening this BZ to fix other SSM page(s), closing the new BZ as a dup   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067#c8)  Grant Gainey    2017-08-22 11:55:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1483877](show_bug.cgi?id=1483877 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Updates icons are not displayed in SSM Errata page") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067#c9)  Grant Gainey    2017-08-23 17:42:18 UTC  ``` Root cause here is not the individual pages, but a change to SystemIconDecorator that happened as part of spacewalk 74ebda70d15ece4a721ce22184cf592eb104eea0  Fixing by reverting the previous commit, and fixing the actual base problem.  spacewalk.github: 4843972a168a0b5ff7c7be6c7c36263146f013a5   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067#c12)  Lukáš Hellebrandt    2017-08-24 12:39:46 UTC  ``` Verified with spacewalk-java-2.5.14-94.el6sat.  Fixed both on /rhn/systems/ssm/ListSystems.do and on /rhn/systems/ssm/ErrataSystemsAffected.do?eid=<ERRATA_ID>, the status icons are now displayed correctly.  Also checked this doesn't break functionality from commit 74ebda70d15ece4a721ce22184cf592eb104eea0 which introduced this bug; page /rhn/systems/VirtualList.do seems fine, there are no tracebacks, even in case of "placeholder" system like "Host: (Unknown Host)" - this is thanks to commit 3c374f149e079370537e5f514ef9b93746640de7 which fixed the page for this case.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1475067#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-09-06 12:27:53 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
