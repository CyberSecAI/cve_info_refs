Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2017-24

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 57

Announced
November 14, 2017
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 57

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

##### References

* [Bug 1406750](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406750)
* [Bug 1412252](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412252)

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

##### References

* [Bug 1408990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990)

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

##### References

* [Bug 1392026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026)

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1370497](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497)

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

##### References

* [Bug 1402363](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363)

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1401339](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339)

#### [#CVE-2017-7837: SVG loaded as <img> can use meta tags to set cookies](#CVE-2017-7837)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

SVG loaded through `<img>` tags can use `<meta>` tags within the SVG data to set cookies for that page.

##### References

* [Bug 1325923](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923)

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

##### References

* [Bug 1399540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540)

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

##### References

* [Bug 1402896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896)

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

##### References

* [Bug 1366420](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366420)

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.

##### References

* [Bug 1397064](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397064)

#### [#CVE-2017-7827: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 57](#CVE-2017-7827)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

jfkthame: [bug 1370504](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370504 "RESOLVED INVALID - URL spoofing via IDN - MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE") is also related.
So presumably this is because we allow any single script plus Latin. This seems like the tip of the iceberg; various scripts are going to have all sorts of combining modifiers which one can match up with a Latin letter which happens to have pixels in the right place to hide it.
Can we enforce that Arabic modifiers only go on Arabic letters, and so on?

Possibly, though it's not quite that simple (the Arabic vowel marks are also used in Syriac, for example).
I'm not sure we even have to look at other scripts to find diacritic-based "spoofs"; there are small, easily-overlooked diacritics in the Combining Marks block at U+03xx that I suspect many users would miss. Consider something like <https://www.xn--google-e4d.com/> ... this has a combining dot under the second "g", but it's hardly noticeable.
And then there are delights such as <https://www.xn--mozlla-r9a478a.com/>. Do domain registrars have policies that disallow things like this? AFAICS the IDN rules would permit it...

Domain registrars should, and often do, have policies which check if a registration is homographic with another registration. But this is different - this is adding a tiny extra combining mark and hoping it doesn't get noticed. So they homographs are not exact in in that sense, and probably won't be detected by the standard algorithm. But visually, the results are still very similar.
So I think we have an issue that this is a form of spoofing which is not entirely addressed by the current algorithms. Now, my understanding is (correct me if I'm wrong) that these small dots and combining marks and so on are all allocated to one or more scripts in the Unicode Character Database. Is that right? If so, why doesn't our script mixing code detect this? Are some of these dots allocated to Latin? Or is it because we allow "Latin plus one other", and so "Latin plus a random combining mark" will always be allowed?

Generally, combining marks are considered to "inherit" the script property of the base character to which they're applied, and can in principle be used with any script. There are some -- e.g. from Arabic and Indic scripts -- that have one or more specific scripts with which they're normally associated (listed in ScriptExtensions.txt), but the general Combining Marks block (at U+03xx) is for the most part entirely script-agnostic. Something like "combining dot below" certainly has legitimate usage in Latin script, so there's no expectation that script-mixing prohibitions would be relevant.
The original report here relates to an Arabic vowel mark, which is also used in Syriac, but arguably should not be combined with Latin letters (it's not "wrong" to do so, in strictly Unicode terms, but it's sufficiently implausible that IDN rules could reasonably block it). But the more general issue of small, easily-overlooked diacritics can't be fixed that way, as many of them are truly generic -- or even primarily (though not exclusively) used with Latin script.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

Hmm.
It seems like there are a few ways we could go here.
Firstly, we could try and improve font rendering technology in some way such that such marks were more obvious when used - e.g. if they overlapped an existing bit of a letter, they didn't just disappear. This would be a Firefox (or graphite2?) fix (and a complex one).
Secondly, we could just disallow most combining marks, perhaps with a whitelist of those which were script-specific. People making domain names would need to use precomposed characters, or just not use the mark (just as e.g. English names can't have an apostrophe in LDH domain names). This has the risk of upsetting one or more language communities, particularly as ISTR that Unicode has gone backwards and forwards on whether scripts require precomposed versions of common letter+mark combos, and so some scripts may have them and others may not.
Thirdly, we could try and develop a set of rules about where combining marks were allowed. This would probably involve the Unicode Consortium, either by getting them to better classify the allowed scripts for the generic combining marks (perhaps in an advisory rather than a normative way), or even by enumerating the allowed letters for each mark. These rules could either be implemented in browsers (as they don't require knowledge of all existing domain names, as homograph algorithms do) or by registries. The risk here is ending up with a massive data table that you need to ship to solve a very niche problem.
Do we need to consult the usual suspects at the Unicode Consortium to ask them for advice at this point?

In the case of KASRA I don't see it at all in the URL bar on Mac: it seems to be below the visible area. If I click on <http://xn--google-yri.com/> I see it in the body text of the Server Not Found page (almost looks like a spec of dust on my screen), but not where it matters in the address bar. The two examples in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL spoofing using combining marks") are visible. Easy to miss for sure, but at least the differences are there for the eagle-eyed.
> Do we need to consult the usual suspects at the Unicode Consortium to ask

Probably for the best.
How does the KASRA character look on Windows? Since that's where most people are that's probably the one the determines if we call this sec-moderate or sec-high.Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---)

See <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=729979> for some mitigation the Chromium folk have implemented, although AFAICT it's not a complete solution to the general issue.

Yeah, seems to me that those mitigations are pretty specific. I'm not particularly interested in playing whack-a-mole such that what Firefox allows changes every release for the next 10 releases.

Attached patch

[Check ScriptExtensions property of combining marks when available](attachment.cgi?id=8910325&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1370497&attachment=8910325)

Here's a patch that provides some mitigation, based on the Unicode ScriptExtensions property that identifies some combining marks as being used with particular script(s) even though they have Script=INHERITED as their primary property. This blocks things like the Arabic-vowel-on-Latin-letter example here.

Check ScriptExtensions property of combining marks when available
This seems a pretty sensible and general mitigation. We may also have to switch to strict as well, but this seems orthogonal to that.

Just FTR, since [bug 1402048](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402048 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove the legacy non-IDNA2008 code path from nsIDNService, now that we always require ICU to build") has just landed, I'll remove the #ifdef IDNA2008 from this patch as this is now unconditionally the way we build.

This doesn't seem to me to really meet the ESR criteria, and I see we've marked other examples such as [bug 1399540](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox IDN display vulnerability") as wontfix there. (Feel free to disagree if you think there's an ESR case to make.)

Hi Dan, given that this is a sec-mod and too many uplifts in beta57 already, I am leaning towards wontfix'ing this for 57. I'd like to get your opinion before making a final decision here. Thanks!Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

We keep getting dinged for this so it'd be nice to fix sooner, and the patch isn't scary. But in practice real phishing sites are making enough money from non-spoofing domain names. I guess we could live without it in 57 :-(Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Check ScriptExtensions property of combining marks when available
Thanks Dan. Sorry! :( 57 is getting an unusually large # of uplift requests. I'd like to keep our risks to quality and shipping on time to a minimal. I'd prefer to let this one ride the 58 train.

An argument in favor is that we're already fixing [bug 1399939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399939 "VERIFIED FIXED - IDN script mixing policy: Consider switching to highly-restrictive") in Firefox 57 and it'd be nice to change the IDN behavior all at once.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Attached patch

[patch, don't allow IDNs with dotless-i + accent above](attachment.cgi?id=8918673&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8918673&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1408782&attachment=8918673)

Any domain name that includes a letter "i" with an accent above (acute, grave, circumflex, dieresis, etc) can be perfectly spoofed using a sequence <dotless i, combining accent>, which is not canonically equivalent yet will display identically given reasonable font support.
For example,
<http://xn--nave-6pa.com> (<http://naïve.com>, with precomposed i-dieresis)
could be spoofed by
<http://xn--nave-mza04z.com> (<http://naı̈ve.com>, with dotless-i + dieresis)
on any system where the font used by the URL bar supports such combining marks (true for both macOS and Windows, AFAIK, and probably most modern systems).
IMO, this is a more important fix than some of the other potential spoofs that have been reported lately, as it does not depend on users overlooking a minor distinction, or on poor font support; rather, in the presence of fonts with good Unicode and diacritic support, the resulting spoof will (by definition) be visually perfect.
Such URLs (any that include U+0131 DOTLESS I followed by a diacritic above) should be forced to display as punycode.
(FTR, I have also filed an equivalent bug against Chromium, as their "dangerous" URL check doesn't currently catch such examples either.)

I'm going to call this sec-moderate, like most other Unicode-based spoofing bugs. Fortunately, although this provides a "perfect" spoof for domain names with accented "i" in them, such domain names are themselves pretty rare. (I only found a handful in the top million domains as listed on <https://domainpunch.com/tlds/topm.php> -- and FWIW, several of those appeared to be using accented "i" just to work around court-ordered blocks on their "original" unaccented forms!)Assignee: nobody → jfkthameKeywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

I think that, like all such heuristics, we should get cross-browser agreement before implementing in a release build. I can see the point here - dotless i is a bit unusual in the doing normalization doesn't canonicalize it in the way you expect.
jfkthame: are there any languages which expect to, er, use a dotless i with some sort of dot, without it being actually a dotted i? I assume not...

This also affects earlier releases, but I'm assuming we wouldn't consider uplifting anywhere earlier than beta-57 for an issue like this.

(In reply to Gervase Markham [:gerv] from [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Potential \"visually perfect\" spoofing of the letter 'i' (with or without accents) in domain names"))

FWIW, Chrome recently landed a change that blocks IDNs with U+0307 (combining dot above) over dotless i, which I realize I should have specifically highlighted, as it can be used to spoof even pure-ASCII domains like mozilla.com or microsoft.com (try xn--mozlla-r9a478a.com and xn--mcrosoft-tkb418b.com respectively). So the issue here is not ONLY about accented i, it applies to basic Latin i as well. And Chrom[e,ium] is on course to ship a fix for the basic "i" case, at least; I filed a bug report (and patch) in the chromium bug tracker to extend that to cover the accented "i"s as well.
> I can see the point here -

Exactly; the "soft-dotted" property of i is a special case where normalization actually introduces confusion. (There would be a similar problem with U+0237 DOTLESS J, but it is already excluded from the acceptable IDN character set.)
> jfkthame: are there any languages which expect to, er, use a dotless i with
> some sort of dot, without it being actually a dotted i? I assume not...
I'm not aware of any. I suppose a language that used both dotted and dotless i (like Turkish), and also used accents that could be applied to either, would probably have to retain the dot on accented i (and put the acute or whatever above it) in order to maintain the distinction. But AFAIK nobody actually does such a thing. And if they did, the (immutable and non-locale-specific) rules of Unicode normalization would be a bit awkward for them...
(I've seen statements to the effect that Lithuanian, IIRC, has a typographic convention that retains the dot on i when adding an accent, but I don't believe it also uses dotless ı; and it's unclear to me whether that's really a requirement of the language, or just an artifact of some older technology -- such as a typewriter -- that didn't support automatically removing the dot when adding an accent to i.)
