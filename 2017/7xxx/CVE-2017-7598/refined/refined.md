{
  "Root cause": "Division by zero in `TIFFReadDirEntryCheckedRational` and `TIFFReadDirEntryCheckedSrational` functions when reading a malformed TIFF image. Specifically, the code does not check for a zero denominator before performing a division.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Division by zero"
  ],
  "Impact": "Application crash, leading to a denial of service.  In some contexts, it may also be possible to trigger other undefined behavior due to the floating point exception.",
  "Attack vectors": "By enticing a user or automated system to open a specially crafted TIFF image.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF file to an application using libtiff."
