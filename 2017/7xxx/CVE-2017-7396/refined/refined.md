Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7396:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2017-7396. The official description of CVE-2017-7396 in the Red Hat advisory, Gentoo security advisory, GitHub advisory and the commit message is a memory leak due to uncleaned objects `SecurityServer` and `ClientServer` during client connections in TigerVNC. This aligns with the provided content.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of `SecurityServer` and `ClientServer` objects in the `SConnection` and `CConnection` classes of TigerVNC. These objects are created but not properly destroyed, leading to a memory leak.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. The `SecurityServer` and `ClientServer` objects are created in the constructors of `SConnection` and `CConnection` but are not deallocated.
    *  The original code used pointer members to `SecurityServer` and `ClientServer`, but did not delete them in the destructors.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly send connection requests to the server, causing it to consume memory resources over time. This can eventually exhaust available memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The Red Hat advisory notes that a remote unauthenticated attacker could trigger the memory leak, causing denial of service.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated client repeatedly sending connection requests to the TigerVNC server.
    * The attack vector is network.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable TigerVNC server.
    *   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**3. Additional Technical Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `CConnection.cxx`, `CConnection.h`, `SConnection.cxx` and `SConnection.h` files of TigerVNC.
*   The fix involves converting the pointer members to direct members of the classes to ensure they are automatically destroyed when the connection objects go out of scope.

**4. Summary**

CVE-2017-7396 is a memory leak vulnerability in TigerVNC where the `SecurityServer` and `ClientServer` objects were not properly deallocated during client connections. This can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker sending repeated connection requests and eventually causing a denial of service. The fix was to make these objects direct members rather than pointer members so the objects are properly deallocated during destruction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub content includes commits associated with the fix, offering additional context and details about the code changes made to address the vulnerability.
*   The Red Hat security advisory provides details on affected products and versions and indicates the severity rating of the issue as moderate with a CVSS score of 7.5 with Network attack vector, Low Attack complexity, no user interaction required, no required privileges and a high impact to availability.
*   The Gentoo advisory also confirms that the vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause denial of service.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of CVE-2017-7396 and its impact.
