Package        : mosquitto
Version        : 1.3.4-2+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7655 CVE-2018-12550 CVE-2018-12551
                 CVE-2019-11779

```
Several issues have been found in mosquitto, a MQTT version 3.1/3.1.1
compatible message broker.
```

CVE-2017-7655

     A Null dereference vulnerability in the Mosquitto library could
     lead to crashes for those applications using the library.

CVE-2018-12550

     An ACL file with no statements was treated as having a default
     allow policy. The new behaviour of an empty ACL file is a default
     policy of access denied.
     (this is in compliance with all newer releases)

CVE-2018-12551

     Malformed authentication data in the password file could allow
     clients to circumvent authentication and get access to the broker.

CVE-2019-11779

     Fix for processing a crafted SUBSCRIBE packet containing a topic
     that consists of approximately 65400 or more '/' characters.
     (setting TOPIC_HIERARCHY_LIMIT to 200)

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.4-2+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c0)  Daniel Romero [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-04-18 11:50:16 EDT  ``` A potential Null Dereference vulnerability was found in the Mosquitto library which could lead in a denial of service in any library implementation.  The affected code is shown below:  File: lib/messages_mosq.c - 154 154 void _mosquitto_messages_reconnect_reset(struct mosquitto *mosq) 155 { 156   struct mosquitto_message_all *message; 157   struct mosquitto_message_all *prev = NULL; 158   assert(mosq); 159  160   pthread_mutex_lock(&mosq->in_message_mutex); 161   message = mosq->in_messages; 162   mosq->in_queue_len = 0; 163   while(message){ 164     mosq->in_queue_len++; 165     message->timestamp = 0; 166     if(message->msg.qos != 2){ 167       if(prev){ 168         prev->next = message->next; 169 	    _mosquitto_message_cleanup(&message); 170 	    message = prev; 171       }else{ 172         mosq->in_messages = message->next; 173         _mosquitto_message_cleanup(&message); 174         message = mosq->in_messages; 175       } 176     }else{ 177       /* Message state can be preserved here because it should match 178       * whatever the client has got. */ 179     } 180     prev = message; 181     message = message->next; 182   }  Taking into account that there is only ONE message within the “mosq->in_messages” pointer: - Line 161: A “mosq->in_messages” (with only one message) is assigned to the “message” pointer - Line 163: Accessing into the while loop - Line 167: As there is only one message, the “prev” struct is NULL so it takes the FALSE branch (line 171) - Line 172: As there is only one message, the “message->next” is NULL, so “mosq->in_messages” is NULL - Line 174: “message” pointer is NULL as “mosq->in_messages” is NULL - Line 181: The NULL dereference vulnerability is triggered as the code is trying to access to a NULL pointer.  An Address Sanitizer report of the NULL Dereference vulnerability (which does not provide too much information) is shown below: AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL                                                                                           =================================================================                                                       ==30788==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000 (pc 0x7fde65abe328 bp 0x7ffe3be3cb50 sp 0x7ffe3be3c920 T0)  ==30788==The signal is caused by a READ memory access.  ==30788==Hint: address points to the zero page.  AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL  AddressSanitizer: nested bug in the same thread, aborting. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c1)  Daniel Romero [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-04-25 07:11:28 EDT  ``` Hi,  Just wondering if further information is required to confirm/work on this vulnerability. If it is so, just let me know.  Thanks, Daniel ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c2)  Roger Light [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-04-25 07:22:33 EDT  ``` There is sufficient information, thank you.  This is my cvss evaluation, would you agree?

The concern I have about this issue is that it was triggered on two "mosquitto_sub" clients which were connected to a reliable mosquitto broker. However, this broker was being "attacked" by a malicious third client which was sending crafted requests to the reliable mosquitto broker.  Therefore, I am worried that a third client (connected to a broker) could crash other clients which are also connected to the same broker.  Regards, Daniel ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c4)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-05-30 10:31:22 EDT  ``` To register the CVE, I need a single paragraph description and a CWE [1]. Can you provide that please?

Can you tell me what versions are affected by this? ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c7)  Daniel Romero [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-08-01 04:21:26 EDT  ``` (In reply to Wayne Beaton from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c6)) > > Description: A Null Dereference vulnerability was found in the Mosquitto > > library which could lead to crashes for those applications using the library. > > CWE: <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html> >  > Thanks for this, and sorry for the delay.  >  > Can you tell me what versions are affected by this?  Hi Wayne,   Tbh I tested the vulnerability within the last versions, I cannot ensure from what version it is vulnerable. I am sorry. Maybe devs have more information about this.  Is this CVE going to be available soon?  Thanks, Daniel ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c8)  Roger Light [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-08-01 07:48:22 EDT  ``` This affects versions 1.0 to 1.4.15 inclusive. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c9)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-08-01 08:30:42 EDT  ``` (In reply to Daniel Romero from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c7)) > Is this CVE going to be available soon?  I will promote the CVE when the project team requests that I do so.  Having said that, in the absence of an explicit request our guidelines state vulnerability should be disclosed no later than three months after they've been reported. Rogers, is there any reason to delay further? ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c10)  Roger Light [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-08-01 08:54:18 EDT  ``` No, please go ahead. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=533775#c11)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-03-27 14:28:17 EDT  ``` Sorry for the delay.  <https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/pull/1770> ``` |  |
