## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

|  | |

On Windows, I frequently see a single RWX ("Execute/Read/Write") 4k block (a single page). Occasionally I see two. This was observed with both Firefox Nightly and Release. This violates Firefox's W^X/DEP protection.
STR:
1. Download VMMap (<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/vmmap.aspx>) and run it.
2. Choose File > Select Process... > Launch and Trace a New Process > Application and select firefox.exe
3. Look at the "Details" block (bottom half of the VMMap window) and sort by "Protection". One or two "Execute/Read/Write" blocks of 4k each are typically visible.
(I have tried to click the "Heap Allocations..." button to examine the RWX page's allocation call stack, but the button remains disabled. I don't know why.)
Desired result:
No "Execute/Read/Write" blocks should be produced.
Also, it would be nice to add an automated test that detects such RWX blocks in the future.

Aaron, I was told you might be able to advise on this. Is there a way to tell where this allocation/mapping is happening? Thanks!Flags: needinfo?(aklotz)

On 32-bit builds we actually intercept VM allocation for memory reporting purposes... perhaps you could overload that to look for RWX allocation?
(Of course, this doesn't handle the case where the protection attrs are changed after the fact, but it's something)

Attached patch

[0001-Bug-1344034-Auto-enforce-W-X-for-WindowsDllIntercept.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8876266&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8876266&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1344034&attachment=8876266)

Using WinDbg, I tracked down the source of the RWX pages. A single RWX page is allocated and assigned to `WindowsDllDetourPatcher::mHookPage`:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e61060be36424240058f8bef4c5597f401bc8b7e/xpcom/build/nsWindowsDllInterceptor.h#440>
This hook page is unfortunately never reprotected to RX, because `WindowsDllInterceptor::LockHooks()` isn't getting called anywhere in the codebase where `WindowsDllInterceptor` instances are being used. Instead, in general, the instances and their RWX hook pages hang around for the lifetime of the process.
So here's a patch that changes the allocation of the hook page as RX, and uses `AutoVirtualProtect` to briefly change it to RWX whenever a hook is written and then immediately change it back to RX. This means the `LockHooks()` functions aren't needed at all, so my patch removes them.
I manually tested this patch with WinDbg and VMMap and confirmed that there are no remaining long-lived RWX pages.

Is this AutoVirtualProtect necessary? If I understand correctly, we'll only be writing to the hooked API and not to the trampoline itself.

You're right, it's not needed. I have removed it from this new version of the patch. (Otherwise the patch is the same.)

Wondering if we could include this patch in ESR52? (Would be helpful for Tor Browser.)
User impact if declined: W^X violating pages remain.
Fix Landed on Version: 55
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Nothing I'm aware of. The backport to ESR52 was very straightforward.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None

This is true. But the more important point IMO is that all the ESR52 Windows users would get the security benefit as well. Otherwise they'd need to wait another couple of months to get it.

as a hole in our exploit mitigation we should give this a security rating. Could be used to store and execute shellcode but would require other bugs to find this one page so sec-moderate sounds about right.
Nominating for a bug bounty at Selena's request.
This missed esr 52.2 but we should get it in for next time.Flags: sec-bounty?Keywords: [csectype-other](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-other&resolution=---),

Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer
overflows and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, denial of service, bypass of the same-origin policy or
incorrect enforcement of CSP.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 52.3.0esr-1~deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.3.0esr-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Masayuki Nakano, Gary Kwong, Ronald Crane, Andrew McCreight, Tyson Smith, Bevis Tseng, Christian Holler, Bryce Van Dyk, Dragana Damjanovic, Kartikaya Gupta, Philipp, Tristan Bourvon, and Andi-Bogdan Postelnicu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 54 and Firefox ESR 52.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Masayuki Nakano, Gary Kwong, Ronald Crane, Andrew McCreight, Tyson Smith, Bevis Tseng, Christian Holler, Bryce Van Dyk, Dragana Damjanovic, Kartikaya Gupta, Philipp, Tristan Bourvon, and Andi-Bogdan Postelnicu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 54, Firefox ESR 52.2, and Thunderbird 52.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.104 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
[I'm filing this as a restricted bug because this is a lack of validation in security-sensitive code; however, I don't see any real security impact here. Feel free to derestrict the bug if you agree.]
On Linux:
1. Launch Firefox.
2. Ensure that a content process is used.
3. Create a non-empty file in the home directory:
$ echo foobar > ~/testfile
4. Attach to the content process with gdb and verify that ~/testfile can be opened in readonly mode (O\_RDONLY=0), but not as writable (O\_WRONLY=1, O\_RDWR=2):
$ gdb attach 4436
[...]
0x00007f4805fa384d in poll () from /lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
(gdb) handle SIGSYS nostop noprint pass
Signal Stop Print Pass to program Description
SIGSYS No No Yes Bad system call
(gdb) print open("/home/user/testfile", 0)
$2 = 40
(gdb) print open("/home/user/testfile", 1)
$3 = -1
(gdb) print open("/home/user/testfile", 2)
$4 = -1
5. Use gdb to inject open("/home/user/testfile", O\_RDONLY|O\_TRUNC):
(gdb) print open("/home/user/testfile", 0x200)
$5 = 42
Actual results:
~/testfile was truncated:
$ ls -l ~/testfile
-rw-r----- 1 user user 0 Jun 19 15:07 /home/user/testfile
Expected results:
The sandbox should prevent any modifications to ~/testfile. O\_TRUNC should always require write access.

The fact that this is possible is a bit surprising IMHO. The design of O\_ACCMODE flags makes it seem like they definitely are intended to be the thing that delimits what access is possible.
I checked:
<http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/open.html>
O\_TRUNC
If the file exists and is a regular file, and the file is successfully opened O\_RDWR or O\_WRONLY, its length is truncated to 0 and the mode and owner are unchanged. It will have no effect on FIFO special files or terminal device files. Its effect on other file types is implementation-dependent. \*\*The result of using O\_TRUNC with O\_RDONLY is undefined.\*\*
It seems Linux does the most unhelpful (and IMHO illogical) thing possible here by allowing the truncate to go through. Is this common on Unices (thereby necessitating it for backwards compat) or is it a Linux misfeature (that might be reported upstream?).
There's no real security impact from this bug, from the security person perspective, but I suspect most users won't find it helpful when you tell them their data being wiped is "not a security bug", so I think we can treat is as such.

Linux made O\_TRUNC work with O\_RDONLY in this (unrelated) commit from v2.6.14-rc4:
commit 834f2a4a1554dc5b2598038b3fe8703defcbe467
Author: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>
Date: Tue Oct 18 14:20:16 2005 -0700
VFS: Allow the filesystem to return a full file pointer on open intent
This is needed by NFSv4 for atomicity reasons: our open command is in
fact a lookup+open, so we need to be able to propagate open context
information from lookup() into the resulting struct file's
private\_data field.

For the record, current FreeBSD also allows O\_TRUNC | O\_RDONLY ("If O\_TRUNC is specified and the file exists, the file is truncated to zero length."), but Windows has the sane behavior ("Opens a file and truncates it to zero length; the file must have write permission. Cannot be specified with \_O\_RDONLY."). Didn't test macOS.

Looks good to me. The comment does make the nature of the bug a little more obvious than otherwise, but I'd expect that anyone who's already gotten code execution in a content process will be able to figure that out no matter what we do to the patch, so we might as well document it.

Since this is rated sec-moderate you can go ahead and land it on trunk. Once it sticks on m-c we can try beta uplift (later this week)

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8882535&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
I'm using a CSP rule (provided as a header, not meta tag) on a page or iframe, where the page contains a script, as follows:
Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts; script-src 'none';
I tested this in Firefox 54 and the 55 beta on Linux 64 bit.
Actual results:
The script executes.
Expected results:
The script should not execute. If you remove the sandbox flag entirely from the CSP rule the script is blocked by the script-src 'none' rule.
If you swap the identical sandbox rule to the iframe (if using an iframe) as an attribute on the iframe HTML (rather than via CSP) then the script is correctly blocked. My expectation would be for the behaviour here to be the same regardless of how you specify the sandboxing.
The example may seem contradictory (to specify allow-scripts to only then block all scripts) but I actually noticed this when attempting to both sandbox and limit scripts to a particular domain (rather than block off all scripts) but noticed that any script was being allowed through whenever the sandbox rule was present via CSP.
The scope of this issue may actually be wider than only allowing through scripts.
I've attached a zip that should hopefully illustrate the basic issue (it includes a node/npm http server wrapper for convenience).

Thanks for reporting, that is indeed a problem. Too bad that we have tests (Test 5 and 11 within dom/security/test/csp/test\_sandbox.html) but actually not testing that exact scenario.
The problem is two fold:
a) we are resetting the principal to a fresh NullPrincipal (if allow-same-origin is not present) but not setting the CSP on that new NullPrincipal.
b) we just check the sandbox flags from the CSP.
I think we should check the merged sandbox flags of the iframe attribute as well as the CSP.
Dan, what do you think, agreed? Once you are fine with the change I'll flag smaug for the dom/ changes to make sure all three of us agree.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

I half agree. Definitely need to set the CSP on the new principal! I'm ambivalent about the second check. If there were sandbox flags from elsewhere (which could only be an <iframe> sandbox attribute, right?) wouldn't they already be applied, and the null principal created if necessary? It probably doesn't hurt much to do it your way, but you're guaranteed to always create \_two\_ null principals for every iframe SANDBOXED\_ORIGIN, even when the majority have no CSP. Or at least no CSP sandbox directives; I suppose you wouldn't reach this point if there were no CSP at all.
If you're in an iframe SANDBOXED\_ORIGIN and already have a null principal then you don't need to create a second one if the CSP is also SANDBOXED\_ORIGIN. You'd have to check for that before you merge the sandbox policies so you could leave it always creating the second null principal in that case if you want. Something like
bool needNewNullPrincipal = (cspSandboxFlags & SANDBOXED\_ORIGIN) && !(mSandboxFlags & SANDBOXED\_ORIGIN);
mSandboxFlags |= cspSandboxFlags;
if (needNewNullPrincipal) { ... }
My biggest worry about this code predates your patch: the Null principal has no Origin Attributes! A document with a CSP sandbox directive (or in your version of the patch all iframe sandbox docs too!) will escape their container. I think you need to use NullPrincipal::CreateWithInheritedAttributes(principal) instead.
That makes me worry about all the other places in the code that call NullPrincipal::Create() with no attribute arguments. Some are probably internal/chrome things, but I bet at least some are wrong.

As a slight side-note, we've said a couple of times in these comments about 'merging' the sandbox policies from CSP and the iframe. This might just be me being slightly pedantic with the terminology, but do we agree it should actually be an intersection of the flags rather than a merge?
e.g. if the iframe sets allow-scripts but CSP does not, I'd expect no scripts to be able to run
iframe ['allow-scripts', 'allow-same-origin', 'allow-popups']
CSP ['allow-same-origin']
resultant applied policy ['allow-same-origin']

Calling this "sec-moderate" as a CSP bypass for now, but it's not one an attacker can force on a site so "bypass" isn't exactly the right word for it.Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

There is a category of websites where this would probably pose a more serious risk to a user.
If you imagine any scenario where you run a service that facilitates HTML transfer in some way; like a HTML page designer where the attacker can save some HTML against your service (or any variation on that, jsfiddle etc) and create a URL that they can share to someone else. Maybe your service attempts to turn off javascript by sandboxing the attacker-supplied HTML for safety or limit the URLs of scripts and resources to known good URLs/scripts.
By taking advantage of this issue they'd be able to run potentially malicious js in another user's browser.

In fact that makes sense to me. Just for the sake of completeness, we wouldn't reach that code if a site has no CSP, so we wouldn't create two null principals for every sandboxed iframe, but I agree with your solution, that makes more sense to only create a new NullPrincipal if necessarily required by CSP.

I haven't paid attention to that when writing the patch, but you are absolutely right, we need to fix that too within this patch and propagate OA correctly for that case.

At the moment we use an OR operation to merge the flags >> mSandboxFlags |= cspSandboxFlags; << which means we really 'merge' the flags. I think this is what should be happening, but that also means that the resultant policy would be ['allow-scripts', 'allow-same-origin', 'allow-popups'].

If that's the case, doing some local tests that seems to be a different behaviour to Edge and Chrome which appear to require the two policies to agree to apply a loosening flag (I'm trying to track down more info on what's supposed to happen here but not turning up anything useful thus far).

All the flags are on by default and the "allow-" directives turn them \*off\*. So allow-scripts (0) ORd with default SANDBOXED\_ORIGIN (0x10) is SANDBOXED\_ORIGIN, etc. The resulting merged policy will be what we all expect: unless all policies allow something it stays default blocked.

mSandboxFlags isn't used in the below. Could we move it below the if-block so it doesn't confuse what's going on? Otherwise people will try to figure out why it's relevant here. Could even give it its own comment like "merge the CSP sandbox directives into any pre-existing sandbox flags"

bug\_1377426\_csp\_sandbox\_allow\_scripts.patch
Approval Request Comment
The problem itself allows to drop CSP enforcement if certain iframe sandbox flags are set as iframe attribute as well as CSP flag. The reason we should consider this for ESR though is that we don't set OA on the new principal which allows to break out of the container - we should fix that.
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
I think this problem has been in our codebase since we introduced CSP.
[User impact if declined]:
CSP enforcement might be dropped in certain conditions. E.g. when special sandbox flags are set as an iframe attribute as well as within the shipped CSP.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Not yet.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
No (see [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1377426#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Other CSP rules ignored when specifying sandbox 'allow-scripts'") if needed)
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
none
[Is the change risky?]:
No, small change that only affects CSP.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
see above
[String changes made/needed]:
No
[Approval Request Comment]

I attempted to land this on ESR52 but had to backout because it doesn't have SetCsp there :(. You can use the commit below as a starting point as it already has some rebasing done.

Ryan, using your rebased patch ^^ as well as also uplifting the SetCSP parts from [Bug 1073952](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073952 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP can be bypassed with <iframe [sandbox] and [srcdoc]>") (within this patch) it seems everything works. I ran a bunch of tests locally including test\_sandbox.html -> seems to work. Dunno what kind of commit message we would need for this patch though.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

[bug 1073952](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073952 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP can be bypassed with <iframe [sandbox] and [srcdoc]>") is nearly the same as this bug (maybe a little less impact). We should really just take all of it. Landing 7 of 8 chunks and then not actually fixing the old problem just looks silly.

Freddy, instead of just uplifting the SetCSP bits from [Bug 1073952](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073952 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP can be bypassed with <iframe [sandbox] and [srcdoc]>"), we decided to take that whole patch (modulo tests). Since the patch did not apply completely cleanly I had to manually rebase the patch. Can you take a look and make sure I haven't missed anything? Thanks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1479227#c0)  Doran Moppert    2017-08-08 06:55:33 UTC  ``` A mechanism that uses AppCache to hijack a URL in a domain using fallback by serving the files from a sub-path on the domain. This has been addressed by requiring fallback files be inside the manifest directory.
