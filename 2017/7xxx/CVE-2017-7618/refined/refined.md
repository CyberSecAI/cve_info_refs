Based on the provided patch and its description, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how the Asynchronous Hash (ahash) API in the Linux kernel handles `EINPROGRESS` notifications when a hash request is queued and not immediately processed. Specifically, the ahash API modifies the request's callback function to perform cleanup in certain cases (unaligned final or missing finup). When a request receives an `EBUSY` and an `EINPROGRESS` callback is triggered while the request is still ongoing, the ahash API would incorrectly call its own modified callback, instead of the original one, potentially leading to issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Callback Handling:** The core issue is that when an `EINPROGRESS` is returned, the ahash API was calling its modified internal callback instead of the original callback function provided by the caller. This could lead to unexpected behavior since the internal callback wasn't designed to be called as an `EINPROGRESS` callback.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The incorrect callback execution could lead to unpredictable program behavior, potentially causing issues such as use-after-free or memory corruption, depending on what the original callback was expecting and doing.
*   The original callback function would not be notified about the `EINPROGRESS` status, potentially disrupting the flow of the calling application

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to trigger a condition where the ahash request is queued and returns `EBUSY`, leading to an `EINPROGRESS` callback. This would involve sending hashing requests that would result in a full queue.
*   The attack would be primarily a local attack, as it involves interacting with the kernel's crypto API via a program running on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make calls to the kernel's crypto API, meaning a user with appropriate privileges to use the ahash API through system calls, or a kernel module.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the system in a way to cause ahash requests to be queued and receive an `EBUSY`, leading to an `EINPROGRESS` notification.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided patch introduces a temporary request object on the stack to relay `EINPROGRESS` back to the original completion function, ensuring the correct callback is invoked when a request is not processed immediately. It also preserves original flags value, another detail not initially handled correctly.
*   The fix involves adding the `ahash_notify_einprogress` function, which is specifically designed to relay the `EINPROGRESS` to the original callback. The code is also improved to handle the case where `EINPROGRESS` happens during final operations (`ahash_def_finup_done1`).
*   The patch also fixes a missing `ahash_request_flags` definition.
