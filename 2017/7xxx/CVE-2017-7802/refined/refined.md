  "CVE-2017-7802": {
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating the DOM during the resize event of an image element. If these elements have been freed due to a lack of strong references, a potentially exploitable crash may occur when the freed elements are accessed.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a use-after-free condition triggered during the resize event of an image element. Specifically, when manipulating the DOM during a resize, if image elements are freed due to a lack of strong references, accessing these freed elements results in a crash.",
      "weaknesses": [
