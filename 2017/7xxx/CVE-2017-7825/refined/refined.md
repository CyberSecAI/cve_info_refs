  "CVE-2017-7825": {
    "description": "Several fonts on OS X display some Tibetan and Arabic characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks. *Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*",
    "root_cause": "Some fonts on OS X incorrectly render certain Unicode characters as blank spaces instead of displaying them, which can be used to spoof domain names.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect font rendering",
      "Domain spoofing vulnerability",
      "Lack of proper handling of specific unicode characters"
    ],
    "impact": "Domain name spoofing, potentially tricking users into visiting malicious websites by making the domain appear legitimate.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Using the address bar to display malicious domain names disguised with blank characters",
       "Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)"
     ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a domain name using the problematic Unicode characters.",
    "attacker_position": "Remote",
     "details": "The vulnerability stems from specific Apple fonts (STSong / Songti) that have blank glyphs for some Unicode characters (U+0620, 06EE, 06EF, 06FF, 065F, and certain Tibetan characters). This causes these characters to appear as spaces in the address bar, allowing an attacker to make a spoofed domain name appear identical to a legitimate domain. The fix involves adding these characters to a blacklist within Firefox to ensure they are not rendered as spaces."
