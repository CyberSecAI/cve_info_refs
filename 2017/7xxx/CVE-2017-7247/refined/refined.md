Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which aligns with the description of CVE-2017-7247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within the `multiple_freeleech.php` file of the Gazelle software. Specifically, HTTP POST parameters are not properly filtered, allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the web page. This occurs due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session when they access the vulnerable web page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Parameters:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious payloads within HTTP POST parameters sent to the `multiple_freeleech.php` URL. Specifically, the 'torrents' and 'size' parameters are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Payload Construction:** The attacker must be able to construct malicious payloads containing JavaScript or HTML that exploits the lack of sanitization, using techniques such as escaping HTML context, or breaking out of input fields. The provided PoC demonstrates these techniques.
- **Targeted User Access:** While the attack is server-side (as it involves exploiting the application) the injected script runs in the browser of any user that accesses the page, meaning an attacker doesn't necessarily need access to the server directly but rather a user that interacts with the vulnerable application page.

**Additional Notes**

-   The provided PoC examples use the `alert()` JavaScript function to demonstrate the execution of arbitrary code. In a real-world attack, more malicious JavaScript code could be used to achieve various objectives.
-   The provided code snippets show how to exploit the vulnerability using both the `torrents` parameter by breaking out of a `<textarea>` and injecting JavaScript, and the `size` parameter by breaking out of an `<input>` and injecting JavaScript as well.
-   The content from scriptzteam provides a way to patch this vulnerability, by including `anti_xss.php`. However it's important to verify that the included patch is secure and not just a naive attempt at fixing the issue.
