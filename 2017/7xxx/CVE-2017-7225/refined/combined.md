# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201801-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.29.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.29.1-r1** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF, tekhex, PE, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial of
Service condition.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.29.1-r1"

```
### References

 Free the Software! Free Software hosting for core toolchain and developer tools  **Did you know about:** [builder.sourceware.org](https://builder.sourceware.org/), [patchwork.sourceware.org](https://patchwork.sourceware.org/), [inbox.sourceware.org](https://inbox.sourceware.org/) and [snapshots.sourceware.org](https://snapshots.sourceware.org/)?  News/Announcements **June 16, 2024** [binutils](https://snapshots.sourceware.org/binutils/trunk) and [gdb](https://snapshots.sourceware.org/gdb/trunk) now also generate code snapshots on [snapshots.sourceware.org](https://snapshots.sourceware.org).   **June 10, 2024** Sourceware infrastructure [community updates](https://inbox.sourceware.org/20240605165358.GT12557%40gnu.wildebeest.org/) for Q2 2024. Ongoing rDNS email issue [now resolved]. Aging inactive users policy. Sourceware hosts are not affected by the latest xz backdoor. Sourceware infrastructure security vision. Upgraded server2. Sourceware @ Conservancy - Year One. Sourceware Open Office hours.   **May 29, 2024** Sourceware @ Conservancy - [Year One](https://inbox.sourceware.org/20240529190215.GA26515%40gnu.wildebeest.org). Communications (lots, also on the fediverse), New and updated services (snapshots server, email, public-inbox, cgit), Security (CVEs, git signing, autoregen builders, aging inactive users, secure supply chain), New and upgraded hardware (thanks Red Hat OSUOSL and StarFive), Finances (we spend hundreds and raised thousands of dollars), Next year plans (more, bigger and isolated), Conclusion (Five Stars, Would Recommend).   **May 28, 2024** The [Sourceware infrastructure security vision](https://sourceware.org/sourceware-security-vision.html) explains what Sourceware is, the mission, how the organization works, the secure Sourceware project goals and plans.   **April 22, 2024** server2.sourceware.org now has 512GB RAM, thanks Red Hat.   **April 18, 2024** Updated [Sourceware infrastructure plans](https://inbox.sourceware.org/gcc/20240417232725.GC25080%40gnu.wildebeest.org/T/) discussion.   **April 9, 2024** Proposed [aging inactive users](https://inbox.sourceware.org/overseers/ZhQZXogZMozVjIYn%40elastic.org/T/) policy.   **April 1, 2024** Join the discussion [Mitigating and preventing the next xz-backdoor](https://inbox.sourceware.org/20240401150617.GF19478%40gnu.wildebeest.org/).  * Replicatable isolated container/VMs are nice, we want more. * autoregen buildbots, it should be transparent (and automated) how to regenerate build/source files. * Automate (snapshot) release tarballs. * Reproducible releases (from git).    See the [news and announcements page](news.html) for other new (or formerly new) things.  ---   [@fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/%40sourceware) Announcements, notices about downtime and temporary issues with our network are also posted to the fediverse [@sourceware@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/%40sourceware) [@fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/%40sourceware) ---   Get on the **free software announcements mailing list**!   ---    Occasionally asked questions:  **I can't access the ftp site. Mirrors?** There are several sites which mirror the free software ftp site. You can see the full list on the [free software mirrors list page](mirrors.html).   **What is your true name?** [sourceware.org](https://sourceware.org/). But I am also called [cygwin.org](https://cygwin.com/), [coretoolchain.org](https://coretoolchain.org), [dwarfstd.org](https://dwarfstd.org/), [elfutils.org](https://elfutils.org/), [gcc.gnu.org](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [gnu.toolchain.dev](https://toolchain.dev/), [systemtap.org](https://systemtap.org/), and [valgrind.org](https://valgrind.org/). During the dot-com boom years I was called *sources.redhat.com* and *sourceware.cygnus.com*.   **How are the projects chosen? Can I host my free software project there?** Currently, we are pleased to be able to provide a home for various core toolchain and development tool offerings and certain [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/) packages such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [GDB](gdb/), [glibc](glibc/), [Binutils](binutils/), and others. However, we currently only have the capacity to host a limited number of projects. So, while it doesn't hurt to ask if your project can be hosted here, we do have to be selective in what we offer. With luck, this will change soon, as we are contemplating increasing the capacity of both the sourceware.org system and the internet connection that it uses to communicate with the outside world.   **I need an account on sourceware for git/svn/cvs write access to project *XYZ*?** We have an XYZ Project? Cool!  Ok, you need write access for a project hosted on Sourceware you say? Well, first you'll need to have your request approved by the project maintainer(s). Once they give their ok, you can use our [handy dandy little form](/cgi-bin/pdw/ps_form.cgi) and we'll process your request. This will provide you with an account on sourceware.org. If, in the future, you want to contribute to the repository of another project (remember that sourceware.org, cygwin.com and gcc.gnu.org share projects), have a responsible party send email to the admin-requests mailing list at this site requesting that you be added to the project. *Do not fill this form out again.*   **Do you have a privacy statement for this site?** Hey, why not.  We're not recording anything about you, short of the normal web logs which show what pages are being downloaded by what host. We'd never use any of the mailing list subscription information for anything other than the normal distribution of e-mail to that list. We are not out to get you.  Oh, from time to time we do generate some aggregate reports but those don't identify you individually, so stop worrying.   **A lot of the software here is compressed in the .bz2 format. What is that?** bzip2 (".bz2") is a compression program similar to gzip (".gz"), but it produces much smaller files than gzip. You can get the source for bzip2, or pre-built binaries for most platforms, from the [bzip2 home page](https://sourceware.org/bzip2/). Most recent free software distributions include bzip2, so you may already have it on your system.   **Is it true that the first lunar landing was faked?** Of course. Everyone knows that. See the PBS documentary about it, [Capricorn One](https://imdb.com/Title?Capricorn+One+(1978)).    Spam harvesters lookee here! aaaspam@sourceware.org |
