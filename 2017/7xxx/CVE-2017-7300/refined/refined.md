Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one error in the `aout_link_add_symbols` function within `aoutx.h`. This function was intended to catch corrupt binaries, but the error allowed out-of-bounds reads when checking the string offset.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A read of size 1 occurs outside the allocated heap memory, leading to a crash.
- Invalid memory access: Valgrind analysis shows conditional jumps depending on uninitialized values and invalid reads of size 8 at an address that is not mapped.
- Off-by-one error: The core issue stems from an incorrect boundary check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a crash of the linker (`ld`) due to a segmentation fault. This prevents the successful linking of object files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious/corrupted input file: The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted or corrupted input file that the linker processes.
- The input file contains an invalid symbol string offset, which causes the out-of-bounds read.
- The provided example input file is: `\x08\x01\x000\x08\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x0000000\x00\x00\x000000\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x000000000000000000000000000000000000000\x00\x00\x00\x1400000000000000000000\x00\x00\x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted input file to the linker. This could be achieved by creating a malicious object file, or injecting modified data into a file processed by `ld`.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug was discovered during fuzzing with AFL (American Fuzzy Lop).
- The vulnerability affects binutils versions prior to the fix, specifically versions 2.24, 2.26.1 and 2.28
- A patch was quickly implemented to correct the off-by-one error.
- The fix was applied to `aoutx.h`, which indicates an issue in handling the AOUT (Assembler Output) file format.
- The bug report mentions the issue manifesting as an invalid read with a size of 1, and a heap-buffer-overflow when using AddressSanitizer, and an invalid read of size 8 and conditional jump based on uninitialized data with Valgrind
