- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The API authentication mechanism in dnsdist 1.1.0 incorrectly allows access to API methods for users authenticated via Basic Authentication, in addition to the intended X-API-Key HTTP header authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass vulnerability, allowing unauthorized access to API methods.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If the API is configured to allow configuration changes (`setAPIWritable(true)`), a remote unauthenticated attacker can trick an authenticated user into modifying dnsdist's ACLs via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker must trick an authenticated user into visiting a crafted website that performs a CSRF attack against the dnsdist API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website that an authenticated user will visit. The attacker also requires the API to be writable (`setAPIWritable(true)`).
