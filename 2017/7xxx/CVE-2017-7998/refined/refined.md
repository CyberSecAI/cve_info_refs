Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Gespage web application fails to properly filter user-supplied parameters, which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious Javascript code can be injected and stored in the database via printer names. This payload is then executed when an authenticated user views the "My Jobs" page.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious Javascript code can be injected via the registration page parameters. The injected code is reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities can lead to the execution of arbitrary Javascript code in the victim's web browser. This can potentially allow for:
    *   Full takeover of the web browser
    *   Potentially compromising the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   An attacker with administrative access can add a printer with a malicious name containing Javascript code.
    *   Any authenticated user who views the "My Jobs" page will trigger the XSS payload.
*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   An attacker can craft a malicious request to the registration page, injecting Javascript code into form parameters.
    *  Victims clicking the crafted registration link will execute the malicious Javascript

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker needs administrative access to the Gespage application to add a malicious printer name.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  An attacker needs to craft a malicious link that includes the malicious script.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   The CVSS Base Score is 7.3 with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
*   The vulnerability was present in versions up to 7.4.9 of Gespage.
*   A fix was released in Gespage version 7.4.9.
