# WebKitGTK+: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **201710-14**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in WebkitGTK+, the worst
of which may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/webkit-gtk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.16.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.16.6** |

### Background

WebKitGTK+ is a full-featured port of the WebKit rendering engine,
suitable for projects requiring any kind of web integration, offers
Webkit’s full functionality and is used on a wide range of systems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in WebkitGTK+. Please
review the references below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code, cause a Denial of
Service condition, bypass intended memory-read restrictions, conduct a
timing side-channel attack to bypass the Same Origin Policy, obtain
sensitive information, or spoof the address bar.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All WebKitGTK+ users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/webkit-gtk-2.16.6"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
