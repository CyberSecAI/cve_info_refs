{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web server allows access to internal information without authentication via a specific URL. Additionally, the 'Guest' account has excessive privileges, granting access to restricted configuration information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Authentication (CWE-287)",
    "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls (CWE-264)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can gain unauthorized access to privileged information, including status, connected devices, and configuration details.",
  "Attack vectors": "Accessing specific URLs on the web server and exploiting the excessive privileges of the 'Guest' account.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote network access is required. Low skill level is needed to exploit the improper authentication vulnerability, while the privilege escalation vulnerability requires a low-privilege account."
