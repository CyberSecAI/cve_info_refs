Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7976:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow errors in the `jbig2_image_compose` function within the jbig2dec library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow. Specifically, when calculating image dimensions or allocating memory for image data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using the library.
- Denial of Service (DoS). A specially crafted file can cause the application using the library to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attacker: An attacker can entice a user to open a specially crafted JBIG2 file via an application linked against jbig2dec

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JBIG2 file.
- The attacker needs to get a user to open the malicious file with an application that uses the vulnerable library.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the decoding of JBIG2 images.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201708-10) and the Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3855-1) both confirm that jbig2dec is vulnerable to this integer overflow.
- The jbig2dec bug report also mentions that a negative height could cause a crash due to integer overflow, though newer versions of the library prevent a crash and exit gracefully.
