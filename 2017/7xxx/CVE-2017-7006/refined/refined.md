Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7006:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how WebKit handles SVG filters when processing cross-origin content. Specifically, it's related to how the cross-origin buffer is handled during the filtering process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Timing Side-Channel Attack: The core weakness is that by using SVG filters, a malicious website can conduct a timing side-channel attack. This type of attack exploits the slight variations in processing time to infer information.
- Cross-Origin Data Exfiltration: Due to the timing side-channel attack, a malicious website can bypass same-origin policy and exfiltrate data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cross-Origin data exfiltration, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive data from other origins.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious Website: The primary attack vector is through a website with crafted malicious content using SVG filters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website accessible to the victim.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious content using SVG filters to exploit the timing side-channel vulnerability.

**Affected Systems:**
- macOS: OS X Yosemite 10.10.5, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, and macOS Sierra 10.12.6
- iOS: iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, and iPod touch 6th generation
- tvOS: Apple TV (4th generation)
- WebKitGTK+

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by not painting the cross-origin buffer into the frame that gets filtered.
- The vulnerability was discovered by David Kohlbrenner of UC San Diego, along with an anonymous researcher.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory also lists this CVE, highlighting the impact of a timing side-channel attack to bypass the Same Origin Policy, indicating that the issue is not specific to Apple products using Webkit.
