Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2017-7611:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability resides in the `check_symtab_shndx` function within `elflint.c` of the `elfutils` library. This function is responsible for checking the extended section index entries within the symbol table of an ELF file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The `check_symtab_shndx` function in `elfutils` versions before 0.169 does not properly validate the size of the data before accessing it, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the code attempts to access symbol index zero without ensuring that the data is large enough.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a specially crafted ELF file with an improperly sized symbol table, an attacker can cause `elfutils` to perform a heap-based buffer over-read which leads to application crash.
*   **Resource consumption**: As a result of malformed data and missing size checks, the application may try to use excessive amounts of memory.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted ELF files:** The primary attack vector involves the use of specially crafted ELF files containing malformed data in their symbol tables.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to supply malformed ELF files:** An attacker must be able to supply a malformed ELF file as input to an application that utilizes the vulnerable `elfutils` library. This might occur in a context where an application parses and processes untrusted ELF files.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using fuzzing techniques.
*   The fix includes a check to ensure the symbol table data is large enough before accessing the symbol at index zero.
*   SUSE considers elfutils a developer tool that does not receive untrusted input, so they recommend that if you are processing untrusted binary code with elfutils, you should do so on a separate system or VM.
*   SUSE classifies the vulnerability with a low severity.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in elfutils version 0.169-r1 (Gentoo) or a later equivalent version in other distributions, where the fix is to check `data->d_size` before dereferencing `data->d_buf`.
*   SUSE provides a range of affected products and the corresponding patched versions that address the vulnerability
*   The Debian Security Advisory DLA 1689-1 also references this vulnerability.
*   openSUSE-SU-2019:1590-1: moderate: Security update for elfutils also references this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2017-7611 describes a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability within the elfutils library. By providing a crafted ELF file, an attacker could cause the application using the library to crash. Patches for this vulnerability check the size of data before performing an out-of-bounds read, fixing the crash and resource exhaustion vulnerability.
