The provided content describes two distinct vulnerabilities, one of which is associated with CVE-2017-7296.

**Vulnerability 1 (Related to CVE-2017-7295):**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in `httpd-simple.c` within the `cc26xx-web-demo` HTTP server. The `http_state` structure is not deallocated correctly upon a connection close event.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper memory management leading to a use-after-free condition.
*   **Impact:**  A null pointer dereference in the output processing function, resulting in a board crash and denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a POST request via a web browser (e.g. Firefox).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.

**Vulnerability 2 (Related to CVE-2017-7296):**

*   **Root Cause:**  A persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `/mqtt.html` page (MQTT/IBM Cloud config page) of the `cc26xx-web-demo`. Improper input sanitization on text fields allows for JavaScript code injection.
*  **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before rendering in the web page
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable web application, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Injecting specially crafted strings (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`) into any text field on the `/mqtt.html` page via HTTP POST requests.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
