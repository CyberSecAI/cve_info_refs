Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a NULL pointer dereference within the `elflink.c` file of the binutils package. Specifically, there are two instances:

1.  In `_bfd_elf_define_linkage_sym`, a member of a potentially null `elf_link_hash_entry` struct is accessed.
2.  In `bfd_elf_final_link`, a member of a potentially null `elf_section_list` struct is accessed.

These issues occur during the linking process of ELF files when using a link built with clang.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **NULL pointer dereference:** The code attempts to access members of a struct pointer that can be null, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause the binutils program to crash, potentially halting the build/linking process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted ELF files:** An attacker can create a specially crafted ELF file that, when processed by vulnerable binutils, triggers the null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a malicious file**: An attacker must be able to provide the specially crafted ELF file to a user who will then attempt to compile or link it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using clang's Undefined Behavior Sanitizer.
*   The fix involves adding checks for null pointers before dereferencing them and ensuring the extended symbol index section is initialized only when necessary.
*   The vulnerability is present in binutils version 2.28 and fixed in version 2.28.1
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201709-02) indicates that exploitation could be triggered remotely by enticing a user to process a crafted file.
