Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-7018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect scope register handling in `DFG::ByteCodeParser::flush(InlineStackEntry* inlineStackEntry)`. Specifically, the `flush` method was using the current `m_codeBlock` instead of `inlineStackEntry->m_codeBlock` when flushing the scope register, which could lead to an incorrect offset in the stack layout phase.
- Multiple memory corruption issues were addressed with improved memory handling in WebKit.
