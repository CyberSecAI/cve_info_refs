{
  "CVE-2017-7668": {
    "root_cause": "The HTTP strict parsing changes added in Apache httpd 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows `ap_find_token()` to search past the end of its input string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child process to crash or cause `ap_find_token()` to return an incorrect value via a specially crafted HTTP request.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malicious sequence of request headers to cause a segmentation fault or force `ap_find_token()` to return an incorrect value"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send a request to the server."
