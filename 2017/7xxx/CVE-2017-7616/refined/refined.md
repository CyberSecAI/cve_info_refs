{
  "CVE-2017-7616": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect error handling in the set_mempolicy and mbind compat syscalls.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The mm subsystem in the Linux kernel does not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection mechanism when handling errors in compat syscalls. Specifically, if compat_get_bitmap fails it will not prevent copying the bitmap to user space, causing stack data leakage.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can obtain sensitive information from uninitialized stack data by triggering a failure in the compat_get_bitmap operation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local user exploiting the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker requires a local user account."
  }
