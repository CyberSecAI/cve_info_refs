Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow occurs in the ANGLE graphics library when drawing and validating elements using Direct3D 9. This is due to an incorrect value being passed within the library during checks, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a heap buffer overflow, which can allow an attacker to overwrite memory outside of the intended buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Incorrect Value Passing:** The core issue lies in how the ANGLE library handles drawing and validation, specifically passing an incorrect value, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The primary impact is a crash, but it is "potentially exploitable," meaning that if an attacker crafts the input correctly, they could gain control of the program's execution and perform actions beyond crashing the application.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting the heap buffer overflow could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, leading to severe security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WebGL Content:** The vulnerability is triggered when rendering WebGL content within the browser, implying that a malicious website could be used to deliver the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Target User Interaction:** Requires the user to visit a malicious website or interact with malicious WebGL content.
- **Windows OS:** The vulnerability is specific to Windows operating systems when Direct 3D 9 is in use by ANGLE.
- **Knowledge of Graphics and Memory Management:** Successful exploitation likely requires a good understanding of how graphics libraries and memory allocation work.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability was initially reported by Omair.
- The bug report (Bug 1402372) provides a detailed timeline of the issue, including attempts to fix it and why some attempts were not successful.
- The fix was initially implemented by Michael Leu, and later revised and corrected by Kelsey Gilbert.
- Multiple patches were created and tested to properly fix the issue and prevent regressions.
- The initial fix was backed out from release and ESR52 due to test failures on Windows XP debug builds.
- Eventually, a proper fix was landed and the vulnerability was resolved.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox and Thunderbird as both use the ANGLE library for WebGL content.
- The fix was ultimately released in Firefox 57.0.2, Firefox ESR 52.5.2 and Thunderbird 52.5.2
