| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_12\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.113 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Introduction:
The pingsender executable dynamically loads libcurl, using dlopen and hardcoded library list.
According to the manpages, the order of execution for dlopen will be:
When path does not contain a slash character (i.e. it is just a leaf name), dlopen() searches the following until it finds a compatible Mach-O file:
$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, $DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, current working directory, $DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH.
Further:
Note: If DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH is not set, dlopen operates as if DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH was set to $HOME/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib.
The vulnerable file is located on: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/pingsender/pingsender_unix_common.cpp>
The offending dlopen code dlopen is in line 105
mLib = dlopen(libname, RTLD\_NOW);
And in line 84 through 101:
const char\* libcurlNames[] = {
"libcurl.so",
"libcurl.so.4",
// Debian gives libcurl a different name when it is built against GnuTLS
"libcurl-gnutls.so.4",
// Older libcurl if we can't find anything better
"libcurl.so.3",
#ifndef HAVE\_64BIT\_BUILD
// 32-bit versions on 64-bit hosts
"/usr/lib32/libcurl.so",
"/usr/lib32/libcurl.so.4",
"/usr/lib32/libcurl-gnutls.so.4",
"/usr/lib32/libcurl.so.3",
#endif
// macOS
"libcurl.dylib",
"libcurl.4.dylib",
"libcurl.3.dylib"
};
By writing a malicious dylib, in ~/lib, an attacker can attain local execution privileges.
Further - on every subsequent telemetry request, the code will be executed.
Instruction to reproduce:
Save the C file and compile to generate a dyilib:
gcc -c poc.c
gcc -dynamiclib -current\_version 1.0 poc.o -o libcurl.dylib
Ensure that Enable Firefox Health Report is enabled On Firefox -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Data Choices
Open and close Firefox.
This is a bad security practice, you can read more about it (although on a Windows world) on:
<http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2014/01/unsafe-dll-loading-vulnerabilities.html>
Actual results:
Code was executed (Calculator was opened)
Expected results:
A list with the known paths should had been provided.

Yeah, this is going to be tricky on Linux. On Mac it's easy to hardcode the paths where Apple usually puts libcurl, but on Linux there's a plethora of possible places, some architecture dependent (e.g. on Debian). I'll look into this tomorrow, worst case we'll have a very long list.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(gsvelto)

Just checking - this isn't a sandbox escape right? I assume post-level3 (actually level2 even), that the content process would not have the ability to write to ~/lib?

I'm not familiar with Firefox sandbox architecture, but from what I read in the documentation:
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox/Deny_Filesystem_Access>
"Some directories are read/write protected, but this will not provide real security until the bulk of the $HOME directory is read/write protected.
On OS X, the Firefox Profile directory is stored within ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/. ~/Library is read/write protected with a few exceptions for some specific subdirectories. Access to $HOME and other areas of the filesystem is not restricted. i.e., the content process can read and write to/from anywhere the OS permits: $HOME and temporary directories. The ~/Library read/write prevention could be bypassed because the rest of the $HOME is read/write accessible. For example, a compromised process could add malicious commands to ~/.login-type files to copy data from ~/Library when a user logs in."

Unfortunately that wikipage hasn't been updated since october 2016 ( <https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Security/Sandbox/Deny_Filesystem_Access&action=history> ). Based on <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mozilla.dev.platform/sandbox|sort:date/mozilla.dev.platform/HJZg_RVZDao/I3I3yYuDAwAJ> , I think the situation is better than that, especially for 56 which we're shipping next week, but Paul will have more details.

"By writing a malicious dylib, in ~/lib, an attacker can attain local execution privileges."
If an attacker has the ability to put a malicious dylib in ~/lib they \_already\_ have local execution privileges. As Paul was getting at, this is mostly interesting as a potential vector for sandbox escapes, and the wiki quote shows we know our current protection is incomplete.

The Windows problem is worse. The "Current" directory is often easily writable depending on how you launch an executable, and the original search path looked there \_first\_. Even the "Safe" version eventually looked there. Only if you set the search path to "" can you mitigate the worst of the problem. Even then, if the attacker can write to the installation directory or any of the Windows directories they can usually inject into your process--but then again they could also just overwrite your program or one of the legitimate Windows .dlls.Group: firefox-core-security → toolkit-core-securityKeywords: [csectype-other](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-other&resolution=---),

Note that on Windows the pingsender doesn't load any DLL dynamically. This is Mac/Linux specific.

Well, I played a little bit with this, and there are two interesting scenarios in Mac:
a) CWD is the first directory where it's searched. (so potential sandbox escape...)
b) By doing dlopen, you're bypassing Mac gatekeeper (you're not getting the pesky "This binary was downloaded from the internet / was not signed" ) dialog box.
Although I'm happy that it's being taken into consideration (and worked on it quickly... BIG KUDOS!), I'm not sure about the moderate impact classification (due to the gatekeeper bypass by using Firefox signed and trusted binaries....)
Anyways, thanks for your attention. This is my first time disclosing to the Mozilla Foundation and I'm happily surprised by the time to patch.

I've just tested it, double-checked what the pingsender was doing, and I cannot reproduce anymore.

Not really, dlopen() will pick the right library anyway so I thought it wasn't worth the fuss.

[User impact if declined]: Potential security vulnerability, see [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - The pingsender executable dynamically loads libcurl, using dlopen and hardcoded library list. [Mac/Linux]")
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: I've manually verified it but it hasn't received formal QA
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: We can use the STR in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - The pingsender executable dynamically loads libcurl, using dlopen and hardcoded library list. [Mac/Linux]"), it shouldn't be reproducible anymore with this patch applied.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: [Bug 1402966](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402966 "RESOLVED FIXED - pingsender no longer works on Tier3 platforms") will also need to be uplifted if this is uplifted, or we'll break tier 3 platforms
[Is the change risky?]: No
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: the change affects a tool that lives outside of gecko and which was designed so that failures have no impact on Firefox functionality
[String changes made/needed]: None

Well, it won't pick the right one on Linux !x86 !x86-64.

Yep, I was aware of that but couldn't find a reliable way to do it except for adding the entire list of architectures Debian supports to the list. I suppose we can add more as we need them. If there is an easy way to guess the right directory at runtime we could make it more robust though but I haven't investigated that either.

I'm inclined to question the need to hardcode paths on linux at all. There's no stupid fallback like DYLD\_FALLBACK\_LIBRARY\_PATH or the current working directory, and if an attacker can make you run pingsender with an altered LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, you're already owned.

I tend to agree but I'm no security expert so I'm not sure what are the current best practices as far as dlopen() is concerned.

I tend to agree.
0. If you could get libraries into a malicious directory that dlopen would search, probably you could just shadow something like libc that's DT\_NEEDED instead.
1. In particular, it looks like we wouldn't search $ORIGIN in official builds, so the search path should be entirely directories specified in system-level config or in the environment (which, as mentioned above, if that's a problem then you're already owned).
2. The only case I can think of that would cause a sandbox escape as of 57 is if Firefox is run from a subdirectory of /tmp (see also [bug 1386404](/show_bug.cgi?id=1386404 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop allowing Linux content processes to access /tmp")), \*and\* it's built with $ORIGIN in DT\_RUNPATH for some reason. However, in that case the attacker could just replace part of the Firefox install itself, so this change doesn't help.

Shall I open a bug to drop the hardcoded paths from Linux then? I haven't done it yet because I wanted to be 100% I wouldn't be regressing anything but I'm happy to limit this to Mac, it makes things a lot easier.

Yes, but I'd suggest having glandium double-check my reasoning in [comment #26](/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339#c26 "RESOLVED FIXED - The pingsender executable dynamically loads libcurl, using dlopen and hardcoded library list. [Mac/Linux]") and make sure this is safe; he knows the dynamic linker better than I do.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to <https://jsfiddle.net/26nLj6mL/1/>
2. Now go to <https://shhnjk.com/>
Actual results:
<https://shhnjk.com/> is not accessible and says "Bad request" due to Cookie bomb. Same attack can be done from <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/svg_data.html>.
Expected results:
Cookie should not be set by SVG image. Fix of <https://insert-script.blogspot.ae/2016/12/firefox-svg-cross-domain-cookie.html> only prevented setting cross domain cookie. But if site hosted svg image who has content disposition: attachment specified would be affected too. Same for the site who allows data URI in img tag.

Dan or Dragana, do you know why we allow setting cookies from <meta> tags from inside SVG images, esp. when they are used inside <img> tags? That seems surprising to me...
The jsfiddle loads: <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/test.svg>

In [bug 1317641 comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1317641#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - http redirect to data: inherits principal (SVG image cookie setting; object XSS)"), bz seemed to say that the spec technically requires this behavior. Though as I suggested in [bug 1317641 comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1317641#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - http redirect to data: inherits principal (SVG image cookie setting; object XSS)"), we could add a "no images" check in nsContentSink::ProcessHeaderData to prevent this.

I think we should talk to the spec editor about how to get the spec fixed. For example, the way the spec is written right now, a set-cookie <meta> in an XHR response document should also set cookies, which seems obviously undesirable. And yet I expect Gecko does just that right now...Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

A direct fix would be trivial -- just a one-line change. We could just add a "mDocument->IsBeingUsedAsImage()" check to this nsGkAtoms::setcookie comparison, in nsContentSink::ProcessHeaderData():
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b3774461acc6bee2216c5f57e167f9e5795fb09d/dom/base/nsContentSink.cpp#307>
(An automated testcase would be a little more difficult to write, but not too bad.)
But per [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie"), we should first probably figure out more generally which sorts resources should & shouldn't be allowed to use the <meta> tag to set cookies, and get that settled in the spec...

Hmm, my reading of the spec is a bit different than Boris'.
<<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-meta-http-equiv-set-cookie>> step 2 takes us to <<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.3>>, where per step 1 we can ignore the cookie.
So technically we could change our behavior here freely, but I agree that it seems more useful to spec something.
Chromium currently only honors the mata element for HTML documents with a TODO comment about enabling it for XML documents in general: <<https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/loader/HttpEquiv.cpp?sq=package:chromium&rcl=1484828258&l=116>>. I think honoring this only for HTML documents makes sense. What do you think, Boris?
We also have two extra bugs in the meta processing:
1. We ignore whether the document has access to cookies at all, which is the reason that Gecko currently will honor such meta elements for XHR parsed documents. (As far as I can tell, this behavior isn't even spec'ed.)
2. We ignore whether the document is in a sandboxed iframe that doesn't have the allow-same-origin bit set.Flags: needinfo?(ehsan)

To answer the question of what I think our behavior should be, I think we should only honor the meta tag if |doc->IsHTMLorXHTML() && !doc->GetDisplayDocument()|. We should also only honor such meta tags if they appear within the head element, per spec.

> where per step 1 we can ignore the cookie.
Well... sort of, in the sense that not setting cookies ever is technically spec-compliant.
But in practice, the HTML spec should spell out cases in which \_setting\_ a cookie would be a spec violation. And this should probably be one of those cases.
> What do you think, Boris?
Then text/html XHR results will set cookies, right? And HTML imports? And so forth...
Imo we should restrict this to "non-data" documents.

OK, fair. That's still not a duplicate of [bug 1317641](/show_bug.cgi?id=1317641 "RESOLVED FIXED - http redirect to data: inherits principal (SVG image cookie setting; object XSS)"), because <img> tag with data: URI is in fact expected to be treated as same-origin.

I cannot reproduce this issue using jsfiddle.net: when the svg image is loaded from <https://jsfiddle.net/26nLj6mL/1/>, the cookies are not set and not sent to <https://shhnjk.com/> when that URI is loaded.
But I can reproduce it when loading the data: URL approach. Here a fix.

Why not? What prevents it?
Disabling all <meta> for data: is clearly wrong.
The patch says it implements [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie") and 11, but what it does looks nothing like those comments.

I am still able to reproduce in Nightly Fx55.0a1. By visiting site #1, opening Preferences and viewing cookie store. I can see the cookies for site #2's domain.
However, the behavior of error message "Bad request" is something that I cannot reproduce. Site #2 loads just fine.

The !doc->IsLoadedAsData() block makes no sense. What it's doing doesn't match its comment, for example.
What actual policy are you trying to implement? Has an HTML spec issue been raised?

Maybe? I suggested that we should only allow "non-data" documents to set cookies via <meta>.

Anne, please see [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie") and 11. We'd like to ignore <meta> in non-(X)HTML documents and (X)HTML documents that are "data documents" (though that concept doesn't seem to be defined in the spec as far as I can tell). I don't know the best way to track this given that this is a security bug and the spec's github issues are public.

I think we should be using <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#cookie-averse-document-object> instead. That's what document.cookie uses and seems more appropriate.
Can we set some kind of flag that whenever this bug is opened to the public it triggers something that results in specification follow-up? It seems fine to not fix the specification for a bit as long as everyone that is shipping an affected product is informed.Flags: needinfo?(annevk)

According to the spec, we should check for cookie averseness before getting or setting cookies. The spec isn't clear about precedence wrt the CSP check but there's a WPT that fails if we check for document averseness before the CSP check (and therefore don't throw).

Ehsan, this doesn't exactly implement [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie") and 10, but it appears to be the direction the spec is taking (see [comment 40](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c40 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie") and 41) and it does fix the bug.

This will disable document.cookie on file:// URIs. It's worth making sure that what we are doing here is compatible with what WebKit, Blink and EdgeHTML are shipping. r=me assuming that is the case but please double check that. If that is not the case, please let me know, depending on what the reality is we may need to consider updating the spec or do something else...

(In reply to :Ehsan Akhgari (needinfo please, extremely long backlog, Away 8/23) from [comment #52](/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923#c52 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG image can be used to set cookie"))

Ehsan was spot-on here. I tested and found that Safari, Edge, and Firefox (before this patch) all allow cookies on file URIs. Chromium is the odd browser out that does not. This seems like a spec bug that we should raise against the definition of "cookie-averse documents" -- Anne, that does leave us with a decision about what we should do in the meantime. Firefox has explicit code to allow file: URIs (which don't have hosts/base domains) to set cookies but doesn't allow other types of host-less URIs to set them.
So, I can either explicitly allow file: URIs to the list at [1] (keep the explicit whitelist in the spec and extending it) or, instead, check either that the document's codebase URI either is a file URI or has a base domain. In the "old world" of Gecko, where addons could add protocols and URI implementations, I'd probably prefer the latter solution, but now that we're in the new webextensions world, maybe we can hold a firmer line and have a whitelist?
Anne, what do you think?

Instead of hardcoding this, you should include /common/get-host-info.sub.js and use the 'OTHER\_HOST' key. See <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/web-platform/tests/common/get-host-info.sub.js>.
Also see <http://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/server-features.html#tests-involving-multiple-origins> for how the underlying magic works!
Last but not least, please use the location object to figure out the path to the current test rather than hardcoding that one as well, because these tests should run when served from any arbitrary HTTP server, not just Mozilla's setup. |location.pathname.replace(/\/[^\/]\*$/, '/')| should do the trick.

I'd just add "file" to the safelist. file: URLs are typically not considered (as they're not cross-platform other than parsing and not really the web) and I'm not sure "file" should be added to the definition of "network scheme" as that would also affect other things, but I suppose that in the definition of cookie-averse we could mention it somehow. Hope that helps.Flags: needinfo?(annevk)

After talking to dveditz, I think we should hold off on landing the test until this ships.

I think that given the risk that cookies bring, we should hold off on backporting this to branches. It's been labeled as sec-moderate, so I don't think we have to rush and take on the extra risk that incurs.Flags: needinfo?(mrbkap)

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Boris Zbarsky, Carsten Book, Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Marcia Knous, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, and Ting-Yu Chou reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 56. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
