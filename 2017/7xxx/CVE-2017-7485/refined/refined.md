  "CVE-2017-7485": {
    "description": "The PostgreSQL client library (libpq) did not enforce the use of TLS/SSL for a connection to a PostgreSQL server when the PGREQUIRESSL environment variable was set. An man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to strip the SSL/TLS protection from a connection between a client and a server.",
    "affected_versions": "9.3 - 9.6",
    "root_cause": "The libpq library ignored the PGREQUIRESSL environment variable, attempting a non-SSL connection after an SSL connection failed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "libpq ignores the PGREQUIRESSL environment variable"

    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could strip the SSL/TLS protection from a connection between a client and a server, allowing them to record or modify the session.",
