{
  "Root cause": "Heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the `check_group` function within `elflint.c`.",
  "Vulnerabilities": [
    "Heap-based buffer over-read."
    "Improper validation of ELF file structure, leading to out-of-bounds reads.",
   "Lack of proper handling for malformed or crafted ELF files, potentially triggering crashes or excessive resource consumption."
  ],
  "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash).",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Crafted ELF file."
    "Processing a malicious ELF file with `eu-elflint`."
  ],
  "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to provide a crafted ELF file as input to the `eu-elflint` utility.",
  "Additional details": "The vulnerability is located in the `check_group` function within `elflint.c`. The vulnerability was discovered by fuzzing `eu-elflint` using American Fuzzy Lop. The issue was found in elfutils version 0.168 and fixed in 0.169."
