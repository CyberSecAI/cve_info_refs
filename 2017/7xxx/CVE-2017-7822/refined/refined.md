{
  "CVE-2017-7822": {
    "Root cause": "The AES-GCM implementation in Web Crypto API was accepting 0-length Initialization Vectors (IVs)",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The AES-GCM implementation did not adhere to the NIST SP 800-38D specification, which requires IVs to have a bit length between 1 and 2^64-1 (or byte length between 1 and 2^61)."
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability might allow for the authentication key to be determined in some instances",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this by providing a zero-length IV during AES-GCM encryption via the Web Crypto API.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute javascript code that makes calls to Web Crypto API."
  }
