Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1348645](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1348645)

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A mechanism where when a new tab is loaded through JavaScript events, if fullscreen mode is then entered, the addressbar will not be rendered. This would allow a malicious site to displayed a spoofed addressbar, showing the location of an arbitrary website instead of the one loaded.

Attached file
[proof-of-concept](attachment.cgi?id=8833966)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8833966&action=edit)

An unprivileged (standard) user can use the maintenance service to overwrite arbitrary files with junk data. There is no control over what is written to the target file, though the absence of the original data effectively "deletes" it.
For example, running the poc with clobber\_file.rb "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\updater.exe" will lock firefox to the current installed version until an administrator repairs the installation because the existing updater.exe cannot be loaded to be verified.
The root cause seems to be that if GetTempFileNameW in WriteStatusFailure [0] is called with a path like '\\.\c:\foo\clobbered', instead of returning a temporary file like '\\.\c:\foo\clobbered\svc123.tmp', it just returns the input path. WriteStatusFailure then directly writes to the temporary path [1], truncating it's contents with the results of the updater.
WriteStatusFailure can be called with a user-supplied directory in a few places, the easiest way is to put the target in the first argument and not supply enough further arguments to cause GetInstallationDir in ExecuteServiceCommand to fail [2]. This is how the attached clobber\_file.rb proof of concept works.
I haven't tested, but I think the calls in UpdaterIsValid would also be able to be purposely failed with an attacker controlled directory for update.status to get written into. Possibly some of the calls after that point as well, but it gets more difficult once the updater directory is verified as legitimate.
I also tested using hardlinks to redirect the update.status file while using a normal file path to trigger the overwrite - this does not seem to be possible as the maintenance service re-creates the file (which deletes the hardlink, rather than the file that is points to).
Tested on Windows 8.1 x64, Firefox 51.0.1 as well as mozilla-central.

Fairly certain that [bug 1342742](/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM using Updater to overwrite updater.ini") also fixes this bug.

Rob, is this a distinct issue from [bug 1342742](/show_bug.cgi?id=1342742 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM using Updater to overwrite updater.ini") or is the fix for that other bug broad enough that it covered this as well?

#### [#CVE-2017-7760: File manipulation and privilege escalation via callback parameter in Mozilla Windows Updater and Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7760)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Windows updater modifies some files to be updated by reading the original file and applying changes to it. The location of the original file can be altered by a malicious user by passing a special path to the callback parameter through the Mozilla Maintenance Service, allowing the manipulation of files in the installation directory and privilege escalation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7761: File deletion and privilege escalation through Mozilla Maintenance Service helper.exe application](#CVE-2017-7761)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service `helper.exe` application creates a temporary directory writable by non-privileged users. When this is combined with creation of a junction (a form of symbolic link), protected files in the target directory of the junction can be deleted by the Mozilla Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7763: Mac fonts render some unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7763)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Default fonts on OS X display some Tibetan characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1360309](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360309)

#### [#CVE-2017-7764: Domain spoofing with combination of Canadian Syllabics and other unicode blocks](#CVE-2017-7764)

Reporter
Samuel Erb
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode" form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile. We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts."

Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "Mark of the Web" was not correctly saved on Windows when files with very long names were downloaded from the Internet. Without the Mark of the Web data, the security warning that Windows displays before running executables downloaded from the Internet is not shown.
*Note: This attack only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2017-7766: File execution and privilege escalation through updater.ini, Mozilla Windows Updater, and Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2017-7766)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

An attack using manipulation of `updater.ini` contents, used by the Mozilla Windows Updater, and privilege escalation through the Mozilla Maintenance Service to allow for arbitrary file execution and deletion by the Maintenance Service, which has privileged access.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service can be invoked by an unprivileged user to read 32 bytes of any arbitrary file on the local system by convincing the service that it is reading a status file provided by the Mozilla Windows Updater. The Mozilla Maintenance Service executes with privileged access, bypassing system protections against unprivileged users.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith, Mats Palmgren, Philipp, Masayuki Nakano, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, André Bargull, Carsten Book, Jesse Schwartzentruber, Julian Hector, Marcia Knous, Ronald Crane, and Nils Ohlmeier reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

An unprivileged (standard) user can use the maintenance service to read the first 32 bytes of any file as the \_SYSTEM user. Which isn't amazing, but still better than nothing :)
For example, running the poc with arbitrary\_read.rb "C:\Users\Seb\creds.txt" will return the first 32 bytes of the first line in the shell. The full 32 bytes of multiline files can be seen in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\logs\maintenanceservice.log file.
The root cause is that we can trick the maintenance service into reading an arbitrary file in IsStatusApplying [0] by providing a hardlinked update.status where it expects one from the updater.exe. Even though the updater.exe runs, it seems to do so in such a way that it doesn't remove/update the update.status that we have prepared.
When the maintenance service goes to read the update.status from the updater, instead it reads the hardlinked file as \_SYSTEM. It then writes this to the maintenanceservice.log file [1], which is world-readable.
The buffer is only 32 bytes long, so that's all we get out of the file. If all 32 bytes are read, the buf string isn't null terminated so the memory past the end of the buffer is logged as well (until it hits a null byte).
The proof of concept is a little bit rushed sorry - although you can create a hardlinked file as an unprivileged user, I've been having trouble deleting them without elevating. Either elevating and removing the hardlink before rerunning the poc, or using a different directory should fix that. The CreateHardlink binary is a compiled version from <https://github.com/google/symboliclink-testing-tools/tree/master/CreateHardlink>.
Tested on Windows 8.1 x64, Firefox 51.0.1 as well as mozilla-central.

I wouldn't be okay with this if we were losing this logging altogether, but we still get some more limited output from IsStatusApplying's caller StartUpdateProcess, so I think this should be fine.

patch - rstrong will land this with other patches.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
As I see it, it isn't obvious at all
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not at all
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Not yet but trivial to create if this patch doesn't apply.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely

patch - rstrong will land this with other patches.
As a sec-moderate, this doesn't need sec-approval to land on trunk.
Do you think we want to take this on branches or should it just "ride the trains?"

It is a very safe and minor change. Might as well land it on the branches at the same time as the other ones.

Not sure if it needs sec-approval to land other than trunk so requesting since I'd like to land this at the same time as a couple of other bugs in early May.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
As I see it, it isn't obvious at all
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not at all
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Not yet but trivial to create if this patch doesn't apply.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely

patch - rstrong will land this with other patches.
This doesn't really need sec-approval (which only applies to trunk). If we want to land this on branches immediately after it lands on trunk, we should do it early in the cycle (like May 3). Please nominate patches for the affected branches and I or Release Management can approve them.

Hi Robert, you were needinfo'd on this for approval and then just canceled the needinfo. Was that intentional and you plan to request beta and ESR approval still, or...? Just not clear who's holding the ball here.Flags: needinfo?(robert.strong.bugs)

Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
