- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web interface of the Advantech B+B SmartWorx MESR901 Modbus gateway uses client-side JavaScript to handle authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Client-side authentication is inherently insecure, as it can be bypassed by manipulating the client's requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to restricted web pages, potentially allowing unauthorized control and manipulation of the device and connected systems.
- **Attack vectors:**  Attackers can intercept and modify HTTP requests to bypass the JavaScript-based client-side authentication mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote, requires no privileges and requires a low skill level to exploit this vulnerability.
