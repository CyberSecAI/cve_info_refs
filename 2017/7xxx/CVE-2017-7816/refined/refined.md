Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing URL security check in the `sidebarAction.setPopup` function within the WebExtensions API. This allowed extensions to load privileged `about:` URLs in the extension UI's popups and panels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Security Check:** The core issue is the absence of a validation check on the URLs passed to `setPopup` or `setPanel` functions within the WebExtensions API.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to load `about:` URLs, which have elevated privileges, within the context of extension UI elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Check Bypass:**  Malicious extensions could bypass security restrictions intended to prevent the loading of privileged `about:` pages in non-privileged contexts.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, the ability to load privileged URLs could lead to other security vulnerabilities depending on the specific `about:` page loaded and how the malicious extension interacts with that content.
*   **Information Disclosure/Spoofing:** Although not detailed, loading arbitrary `about:` pages could expose sensitive information or allow an attacker to create spoofed UI elements.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WebExtension:** The primary attack vector is a malicious WebExtension installed by the user.
*   **`sidebarAction.setPopup`/`setPanel`:** The vulnerable functions (`sidebarAction.setPopup`, `browserAction.setPopup`, and `pageAction.setPopup`) are used to specify the content for extension popups/panels.
*   **`about:` URLs:** Malicious extensions would need to utilize an `about:` URL to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create/Install WebExtensions:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious WebExtension that users will install.
*   **Understanding of WebExtensions API:** The attacker needs a working knowledge of the WebExtensions API, specifically the use of `sidebarAction`, `browserAction`, and `pageAction` APIs.
*   **Knowledge of Privileged `about:` URLs:** The attacker needs to know of potentially harmful `about:` URLs to load.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was resolved by adding a URL check.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 56 and 57.
*   Firefox versions 54 and below are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was classified as "moderate" severity.
*   The bug report mentions that similar issues affect the browserAction and pageAction APIs and the fix was applied to them as well.
*   A patch was created and reviewed by multiple Mozilla developers.
*  The fix was uplifted to the beta version of Firefox 56.
