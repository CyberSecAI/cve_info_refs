Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs in two functions: `ipvideo_decode_block_opcode_0xA` in `libavcodec/interplayvideo.c` and `avcodec_align_dimensions2` in `libavcodec/utils.c`.
- The commit log indicates the root cause as an incorrect alignment value for Interplay video.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow
- Out-of-bounds write

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution by overflowing the buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted media file that uses the Interplay video codec.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious media file processed by the vulnerable library.

**Additional details from the commit:**
- The commit message in github indicates this fixes a "out of array access" issue found by fuzzing.
- The fix modifies `avcodec_align_dimensions2` in `libavcodec/utils.c` to properly set the width and height alignment to 8 when the codec ID is `AV_CODEC_ID_INTERPLAY_VIDEO`. Previously, this was not being set resulting in out-of-bounds memory access due to incorrect alignment.
