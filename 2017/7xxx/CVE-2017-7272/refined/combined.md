# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Detect invalid port in xp\_socket parse ip address

[Browse files](/php/php-src/tree/bab0b99f376dac9170ac81382a5ed526938d595a)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
For historical reasons, fsockopen() accepts the port and hostname
separately: fsockopen('127.0.0.1', 80)

However, with the introdcution of stream transports in PHP 4.3,
it became possible to include the port in the hostname specifier:

fsockopen('127.0.0.1:80')
Or more formally: fsockopen('tcp://127.0.0.1:80')

Confusing results when these two forms are combined, however.
fsockopen('127.0.0.1:80', 443) results in fsockopen() attempting
to connect to '127.0.0.1:80:443' which any reasonable stack would
consider invalid.

Unfortunately, PHP parses the address looking for the first colon
(with special handling for IPv6, don't worry) and calls atoi()
from there.  atoi() in turn, simply stops parsing at the first
non-numeric character and returns the value so far.

The end result is that the explicitly supplied port is treated
as ignored garbage, rather than producing an error.

This diff replaces atoi() with strtol() and inspects the
stop character.  If additional "garbage" of any kind is found,
it fails and returns an error.
```

This commit breaks some undocumented, but possibly widely used feature.

Using a remote socket description with an extra identifier like this:

`tcp://localhost:80/foo`

used to work, and now breaks.

The entire remote socket specifier is used as a 'persistent\_id', which is used to get a cached persistent connection if available. Adding something unique to the end of the URI would force a new connection to be created instead of reusing a cached one.

I don't know if this was meant to work this way (it is not documented for stream\_socket\_client() but [mentioned in the user comments](http://php.net/manual/en/function.stream-socket-client.php#105393)), so I'm not sure if this is a bug. I know of at least one piece of software that relies on this to work, which is the [Magento Redis cache/session storage module](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/credis/blob/958e188b4c00886ba5f1d98ba5955cea01682a85/Client.php#L430).

Martijn.

Artax also relies on URI fragments for transparent connection limiting per host when using a proxy.

On what versions of PHP has this patch been applied?

I read the Changelog and I saw that in version:

7.0.18 - Fixed bug #74216 (Correctly fail on invalid IP address ports).

7.1.4 - Fixed bug #74216 (Correctly fail on invalid IP address ports).

Anyhow:

7.0.19 - Patch for bug #74216 was reverted.

It's not very clear what versions have been patched

Thanks!

Hi,

Did this bug fix in 5.6.x?

If I want to avoid #74216, do I have to upgrade to 7.1.x?

I read [5.6.37](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-5.6.37/main/streams/xp_socket.c) and I think this bug is not fixed

thanks.

Any clarification on which versions are affected? Has [CVE-2017-7189](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3mh5-9253-628p "CVE-2017-7189") been patched?

Why are related bug reports [#74216](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74216) and [#74192](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74192) private and inaccessible? Any chance this could be fixed?

I have written a mail to security@php.net asking for providing public information about the status of [CVE-2017-7189](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3mh5-9253-628p "CVE-2017-7189").

But based on some research [bab0b99](https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/bab0b99f376dac9170ac81382a5ed526938d595a) was added to PHP 7.0.18 and 7.1.4 fixing [CVE-2017-7189](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3mh5-9253-628p "CVE-2017-7189"):

<https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.0.18/main/streams/xp_socket.c#L568-L612>

<https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.1.4/main/streams/xp_socket.c#L568-L612>

but the code / changes got removed in 7.0.19 and 7.1.5 again:

<https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.0.19/main/streams/xp_socket.c#L568-L605>

<https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.1.5/main/streams/xp_socket.c#L568-L605>

and is still the same up to the most recent PHP 7.4.9 release:

<https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.4.9/main/streams/xp_socket.c#L578-L615>

Due to <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74192> being set to private it is currently unclear if this isn't fixed since the revert or if some other code changes were made fixing this CVE in a different way.
