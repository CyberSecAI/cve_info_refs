Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7272:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in how PHP's `fsockopen` and `pfsockopen` functions parse IP addresses and ports when a combined address string (e.g., "127.0.0.1:80") is used along with a separate port parameter.
- The functions incorrectly handle cases where a port is specified in both the address string and the separate port parameter, leading to the construction of an invalid address (e.g., "127.0.0.1:80:443").
- The `atoi()` function was used to extract the port number which would stop parsing at the first non-numeric character, ignoring any trailing port information passed as a separate parameter, rather than properly throwing an error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Although not explicitly stated as the primary impact in the provided text, the bug report mentions it may cause ssrf vulnerability in Web Application. This is a consequence of the incorrect port parsing, which can lead to connections being made to unintended hosts and ports, if the attacker has some control over the address and port arguments.
- **Incorrect Input Parsing:** The core weakness is the faulty parsing logic in the `parse_ip_address_ex` function. It fails to reject invalid address strings that include a port in the address and a separate port parameter, leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Ignoring Explicitly Supplied Port:** The explicitly supplied port is treated as ignored garbage rather than producing an error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-  **SSRF:** An attacker could potentially use the vulnerability to initiate connections to internal or restricted resources by manipulating the address string and port parameters passed to `fsockopen` or `pfsockopen`.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** The application could fail or behave unpredictably due to the connection attempt to an invalid address.
-  **Security Bypass:** In contexts where connection behavior is dependent on specific IP/port configurations, this could result in unintended network access or expose internal services.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted address string with a port along with an additional port parameter to either the `fsockopen` or `pfsockopen` functions.
- This could be done through user-controlled input, configuration settings, or any other mechanism through which an attacker could influence the arguments passed to the vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to influence the arguments passed to the `fsockopen` or `pfsockopen` functions.
- No specific privileged access is mentioned as being necessary.

**Additional Notes**

- The fix involves replacing `atoi()` with `strtol()` and inspecting the stop character. If additional "garbage" of any kind is found, it fails and returns an error.
- The fix was initially introduced in PHP versions 7.0.18 and 7.1.4, but later reverted in 7.0.19 and 7.1.5.
- There are concerns over potential breakage of undocumented features that relied on this behavior, for example, using URI fragments for connection limiting, as seen in the discussion of commit `bab0b99`.
- NetApp's advisory indicates that this vulnerability, among others, could potentially lead to SSRF.
- The vulnerability is present in PHP versions before 7.1.9, 7.0.23, and 5.6.31.
