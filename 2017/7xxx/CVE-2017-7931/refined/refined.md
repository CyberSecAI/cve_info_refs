The provided content is related to CVE-2017-7931.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by improper authentication in the ABB IP Gateway web server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** A malicious user can access configuration files and application pages without authentication by accessing a specific URL on the web server.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352):** The web server does not sufficiently verify that a request was performed by the authenticated user, allowing an attacker to launch requests impersonating that user.
*   **Unprotected Storage of Credentials (CWE-256):** Some configuration files contain passwords stored in plain text, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to perform actions using administrative privileges.
*   An attacker may be able to gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network access:** The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
*   **Specific URL access:** The improper authentication vulnerability can be exploited by accessing a specific URL.
*   **Malicious request:** The CSRF vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   Low skill level to exploit
*   No user interaction required for the improper authentication and unprotected storage of credentials vulnerabilities.
*   User interaction is required for the CSRF vulnerability
