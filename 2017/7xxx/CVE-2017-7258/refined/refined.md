The provided content relates to CVE-2017-7258.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a directory path traversal flaw in the eMLi Portal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Path Traversal: The application does not properly sanitize user-provided file paths, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: An attacker can download critical files such as application source code, configuration files, and log files from the web server.
- Potential for further attacks: The disclosed information can be used to carry out further attacks.
- Possible execution of powerful commands leading to a full system compromise (although the specific command execution is not detailed in this content)

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests: The vulnerability is exploited through manipulating file paths in the HTTP request URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker does not need to be on the local network.
- No specific authentication is mentioned, so it appears no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the eMLi web server.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable path.

**Additional details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   eMLi : School Management - 1.0
    *   eMLi : College Campus Management - 1.0
    *   eMLi : University Management - 1.0
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):**
    1.  Visit the URL of any affected version.
    2.  Append “`core-emli /Storage`” to the end of the URL.
    3.  The resulting URL will allow traversal of the `/Storage` directory, exposing sensitive files.
