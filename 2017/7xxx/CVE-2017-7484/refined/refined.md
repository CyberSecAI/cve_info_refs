Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7484:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2017-7484 lies in the fact that some selectivity estimation functions within PostgreSQL did not properly check user privileges before providing information from the `pg_statistic` catalog table. This catalog contains data about table columns, like histograms and most common values, to assist in query planning. This lack of privilege checking allowed a non-administrative database user to access potentially sensitive information from tables they didn't have explicit permissions to query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to table statistics, specifically information about column values, which could expose sensitive information.
*  **Missing Privilege Check**: The core weakness is the absence of privilege checks in selectivity estimation functions, leading to unauthorized data access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could steal information about table columns they do not have explicit access to by querying the `pg_statistic` table using vulnerable selectivity estimation functions.
*   The attacker could potentially learn sensitive information about data stored in the database by analyzing statistical information (e.g., most common values in columns).

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a database connection. A non-administrative database user can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a valid database user, but not necessarily an administrator.
*   The attacker needs to be able to connect to the PostgreSQL server and execute queries.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was addressed in PostgreSQL versions 9.2.21, 9.3.17, 9.4.12, 9.5.7, and 9.6.3, and also in Red Hat Satellite.

* Red Hat assigned a "Moderate" severity rating to this issue, which takes into account factors beyond just technical details.

* The fix was achieved by adding security checks to the selectivity estimation functions, ensuring proper privilege evaluation before data access.

* Some content refers to RHSA-2017:1983, which addresses both CVE-2017-7484 and CVE-2017-7486.

* Some content mentions that `postgresql-setup --upgrade --upgrade-from=postgresql92-postgresql` was broken and this is related to upgrading to postgreSQL 9.5, which fixes this CVE and CVE-2017-7486.

* One of the mitigations suggested is use of  `PGSSLMODE=require` instead of `PGREQUIRESSL=1`, this is however related to CVE-2017-7485 and not the primary issue of CVE-2017-7484.
