Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-7921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks on user-provided parameters during the processing of a specific request code within certain Hikvision IP cameras.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The application does not correctly authenticate users.
*   **Password in Configuration File (CWE-260):**  Although this is listed as a separate CVE (CVE-2017-7923), this vulnerability is mentioned in the context of the advisory for CVE-2017-7921 and contributes to the overall risk, where an attacker might gain escalated privileges or impersonate another user by exploiting passwords present in configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized elevated privileges on the affected devices.
*   **Data Tampering and Acquisition:** With escalated privileges, attackers can acquire or tamper with device information, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the system.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can potentially assume the identity of an authenticated user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted requests.
*   The specific request code that triggers the vulnerability is not detailed, but it is processed by the camera, suggesting it's likely through a network protocol used by the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the affected IP camera.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The content mentions the exploit requires a low skill level.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The advisory for CVE-2017-7921 mentions that no prior authentication is needed in the context of improper authentication, suggesting the attacker doesn't require initial user credentials.
* For CVE-2017-7923, which is associated with the password in a config file vulnerability, low privilege access is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects a range of Hikvision camera series, including DS-2CD2xx2F-I, DS-2CD2xx0F-I, DS-2CD2xx2FWD, DS-2CD4x2xFWD, DS-2CD4xx5, DS-2DFx, and DS-2CD63xx with specific firmware versions listed.
*   Hikvision has released firmware updates to address the improper authentication vulnerability.
*   The vendor mentions "grey market" cameras which are sold via unauthorized channels, these cameras might not be updated easily.
