Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-7805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how TLS 1.2 handshake hashes are generated during a TLS exchange when client authentication is used.
- Handshake hashes are generated with a pointer to the message buffer. If the handshake transcript exceeds the initial buffer's capacity, a new buffer is allocated and the pointer is left pointing to the old, freed memory region.
- When the handshake hashes are calculated afterwards, a use-after-free occurs because of the dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Use-after-Free (UAF):** A pointer is left referencing a memory region that has already been freed, leading to a crash or potential arbitrary code execution when the memory is accessed.
-  **Improper memory management:** Failure to update the pointer after reallocating a larger buffer for handshake transcript data

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** A crash can occur which may be exploitable for arbitrary code execution.
-   **Denial of Service:** The crash itself can cause a denial of service condition for the application using NSS.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In a worst case scenario a carefully crafted attack could use the UAF to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application using NSS.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered during TLS 1.2 handshake exchanges, specifically when generating handshake hashes during client authentication.
-   A malicious client can trigger the vulnerability by sending a large enough handshake transcript such that buffer reallocation occurs, triggering the UAF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TLS 1.2 connection with client authentication enabled.
-   The attacker needs to have control over the length of the handshake transcript they are sending to ensure reallocation is triggered before the handshake hash calculation.
- Network access is required to send the malicious handshake.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Martin Thomson and affects the Network Security Services (NSS) library used by applications such as Firefox and Thunderbird.
- The issue can be triggered in WebRTC scenarios as well which enables client authentication.
