## Description

[![@shardulm94](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?u=745105639b8e45030203c058618c27f6b2a8642c&v=4&size=48)](/shardulm94)[shardulm94](https://github.com/shardulm94)opened [on Apr 11, 2017](https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/issues/28#issue-220860387)

**Exploit Title:** SQL Injection vulnerability (Content DB) on FlatCore v1.4.6

**Date:** 11-April-2017

**Exploit Author:** [@shardulm94](https://github.com/shardulm94)

**Software Link:** <https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/archive/v1.4.6.zip>

**Version:** 1.4.6

**Description:**

SQL Injection allows an attacker to run malicious SQL statements on a database and thus being able to read or modify the data in the database. With enough privileges assigned to the database user, it can allow the attacker to delete tables or drop databases.

**Exploit:**

The vulnerability is due to a non-parameterized SQL query at <https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/blob/master/core/functions/func_get_content.php#L17> and a few following lines. We assume that FlatCore is installed at `http://localhost/flatcore/`. The exploit URL is `http://localhost/flatcore/' OR page_status='ghost' LIMIT 0,1 --`. This effectively results in the following query to be executed `SELECT * FROM fc_pages WHERE page_id = '' OR page_status='ghost' LIMIT 0,1 --'` which allows an unauthenticated user to be able to view all ghost/invisible pages without having links to them. The exploit URL can also be possibly modified to leak the content database using UNION based SQL injection attacks.

**Impact:** Read data from the content database

**Mitigation:** Use of Parameterized SQL Queries
