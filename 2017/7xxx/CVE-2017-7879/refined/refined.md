The provided content is related to CVE-2017-7879.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of non-parameterized SQL queries within the `func_get_content.php` file of FlatCore CMS. Specifically, the `page_id` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is a SQL Injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper input sanitization and use of non-parameterized SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `page_id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
*   Read sensitive data from the content database.
*   View all ghost/invisible pages, even if they are not linked to from the site.
*   Potentially leak the entire database content via UNION based SQL injection.
*  Modify data within the database (not explicitly stated but a general risk with SQL injection)
* Delete tables or drop databases if the database user has sufficient privileges (not explicitly demonstrated but is a potential risk with SQL injection)

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that injects malicious SQL code into the `page_id` parameter. Specifically, the URL is crafted to include `\' OR page_status=\'ghost\' LIMIT 0,1 --` within the `page_id` parameter when requesting a page

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FlatCore CMS instance and knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`page_id`). No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
