Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a regression in OpenStack Nova's notification system. Specifically, exception contexts were being logged along with notification payloads.  These contexts contained sensitive information, such as passwords and authentication tokens. This was happening because the notifier was hooked directly into the logger and included all arguments. The issue was introduced in Mitaka release.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) was being exposed in the logs due to the inclusion of the Nova context in the notification payload.
- **Logging of Sensitive Data:** The vulnerability was due to the logging mechanism in the oslo.messaging library, which was exposing the context in the log output.
- **Circular Reference:**  A circular reference within the notification payload caused a ValueError, leading to the sensitive information being logged in the error output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Credentials:** Attackers with access to the logs could potentially gain access to user credentials, tokens and other sensitive information from the notification payload.
- **Compromise of Instance/Tenant:** Gaining access to credentials and tokens could lead to a full or partial compromise of users or the Openstack environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** An attacker needs access to the logs generated by the OpenStack Nova service to view the sensitive data. This could involve compromising the logging system or gaining unauthorized access to log files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Logs:** The primary requirement for an attacker is the ability to read logs generated by OpenStack Nova. This access could be gained through:
    - System compromise of the Nova compute nodes or the log storage system.
    - Unauthorized access to log storage.
    - Gaining access to the logs through other means of system compromise.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was a regression introduced in the Mitaka release of OpenStack Nova by commit `2910d75b28afd909af3b4ac392729ac3d5e64b65` which reintroduced the context in notifications.
- A fix was implemented which removed the context from the payload, and backported to affected versions of OpenStack Nova (Mitaka, Newton, Ocata, and Pike). The fix was in commit  `d1f121265badfffd097ee983d14989b885375a0e`
- The issue was triggered due to a ValueError in the oslo.messaging notification code, caused by a circular reference.
-  The vulnerability was present in the exception handler, which was improperly handling the error when serializing the message.
- Red Hat has addressed this vulnerability in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9 (Mitaka) via RHSA-2017:1508 and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 (Newton) via RHSA-2017:1595, by re-basing to `openstack-nova-13.1.4-1.el7ost` and `openstack-nova-14.0.6-2.el7ost` respectively.
- Ubuntu also released a patch for this vulnerability in versions of nova.
