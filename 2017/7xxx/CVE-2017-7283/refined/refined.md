```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `/api/includes/restore.php` file, specifically within the `downloadFiles` function. User-controlled input from the 'filenames' parameter is passed to `shell_exec` without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) via command injection. The `$data['filenames']` is passed to `shell_exec`, which executes a command containing unsanitized filenames, allowing arbitrary command execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a POST request to the `/api/restore/download-files` endpoint with a crafted JSON array for the `filenames` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Unitrends appliance. No authentication or special privileges are explicitly mentioned as being required to trigger this vulnerability."
