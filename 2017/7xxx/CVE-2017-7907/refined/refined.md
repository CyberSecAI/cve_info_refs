Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper configuration of the XML parser within the Schneider Electric Wonderware Historian Client. Specifically, the software does not properly restrict XML external entity references (XXE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The primary weakness is the software's susceptibility to XXE injection attacks due to improper XML parsing. This allows an attacker to manipulate the XML parser's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious actor could exploit this to cause a denial of service of trend displays in the Historian client.
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the local system where the vulnerable client is running. The contents of these files could then be disclosed to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted XML input processed by the vulnerable Wonderware Historian Client.
- An attacker could achieve this by injecting malicious XML input through the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Skill Level:** The advisory explicitly states that a low level of skill is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Local Access:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attack vector is local, implying that the attacker needs some level of access to the machine running the vulnerable software. It is noted that user interaction is required (UI:R) meaning a user must be tricked into performing some action that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Privilege:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker needs low level of privileges (PR:L).

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Wonderware Historian Client 2014 R2 SP1 and prior versions.
*   **Mitigation:** Schneider Electric recommends upgrading to Wonderware Historian Client 2014 R2 SP1 and applying hotfix HC\_SecurityHF\_10.6.13100.
*   **Reported by:** Andrey Zhukov from USSC
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.6 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)
*   **No Public Exploits:** At the time of the advisory, no public exploits were known to target this vulnerability.
*  **ICS-CERT Recommendations**: Minimize network exposure, locate control system networks behind firewalls, use VPNs for remote access.
