| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1439520#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2017-04-06 07:24:47 UTC  ``` When parsing XML which does entity expansion the SAXParserFactory used in EAP 7.0.5 expands external entities, even when XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING is set to true.  SAXParserFactory parserFactory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance(); parserFactory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1439520#c9)  Jason Shepherd    2017-04-20 00:48:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jason Shepherd (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1439520#c11)  Jason Shepherd    2017-05-11 06:36:10 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Enable the security features of the DocumentBuilderFactory or SaxParserFactory as described by OWASP:  [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#JAXP_DocumentBuilderFactory.2C_SAXParserFactory_and_DOM4J](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#JAXP_DocumentBuilderFactory.2C_SAXParserFactory_and_DOM4J)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1439520#c12)  Jason Shepherd    2017-05-11 06:55:56 UTC  ``` I found a workaround for this issue, which was to set: parserFactory.setFeature("<http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl>", true); I think we should close this one as WONTFIX. But perhaps we can raise a new issues to get the secure options set by default from EAP 7.1?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1439520#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:04:28 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-7464>   ``` |  |
