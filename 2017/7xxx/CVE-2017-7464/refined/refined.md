Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The JAXP implementation in JBoss EAP 7.0, specifically the `SAXParserFactory`, expands external entities when parsing XML, even when `XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` is set to `true`. This indicates that the secure processing feature wasn't correctly implemented or was bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection. This allows an attacker to include external entities in the XML document being parsed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit this to read local files on the server or access internal network resources.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can make the server perform requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially accessing internal services or making connections to external endpoints.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting the vulnerability could lead to resource exhaustion on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through providing specially crafted XML content to the JBoss server for parsing. The server would then attempt to resolve external entities specified in the XML, leading to the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply XML content to the JBoss EAP 7.0 server that utilizes the vulnerable JAXP implementation. This might involve interacting with an application or service that processes XML inputs.
*   The attacker does not need to be within the internal network; they only need to be able to submit the malicious XML to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Mitigation:** The report mentions that the issue can be worked around by setting the feature `http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl` to `true`.
*   **Resolution:** The bug was ultimately marked as "WONTFIX" in the bug report, likely because it was addressed in later versions or through configuration changes.
*   The bug report also references related issues in the Red Hat Issue Tracker, including a move to using the Xalan from JRE instead of a custom fork.
*   The vulnerability exists in the SAX and DOM parsing implementations.
