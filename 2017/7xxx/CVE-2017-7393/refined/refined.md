```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A double free vulnerability occurs in TigerVNC due to improper handling of ClientFence messages. Specifically, when a client sends a fence with data, followed by another fence with no data (length 0), the original fence data is freed. However, a pointer still references this freed data. If another fence is sent, the program attempts to free the already-freed memory, causing a double free.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Double free vulnerability. The code frees memory associated with fence data but keeps the pointer, leading to a double free when the pointer is used again.

- Impact of exploitation: The double free can lead to a crash of the TigerVNC server, causing a denial of service. In some scenarios, it could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.

- Attack vectors: The attack is launched by an authenticated client sending crafted ClientFence messages. The vulnerability is triggered within the `VNCSConnectionST::fence` function.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be an authenticated VNC client capable of sending crafted ClientFence messages to the server.
