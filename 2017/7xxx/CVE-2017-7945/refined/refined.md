Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inconsistent responses provided by the PAN-OS GlobalProtect external interface during login attempts. This difference in responses allows an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209):** The system's differing responses to login attempts reveal information about the validity of usernames. This information leakage facilitates brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Brute Force Attack:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to perform brute-force attacks on the PAN-OS GlobalProtect external interface.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:** Successful brute-force attacks can lead to the compromise of user accounts and potentially gain unauthorized access to the network.
*   **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score of 9.8 indicates a critical impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability if exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or access to the system.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack is considered to have low complexity to execute, so it is relatively easy to exploit.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction.
