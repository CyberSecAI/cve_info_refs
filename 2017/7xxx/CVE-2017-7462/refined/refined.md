Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-7462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A hard-coded manufacturer backdoor exists within the Intellinet NFC-30IR camera firmware. This backdoor allows access to a specific CGI script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The camera uses the hardcoded username "manufacture" and password "erutcafunam" to access the '/cgi-bin/mft/manufacture' script. This constitutes an authentication bypass.
*   **Backdoor:**  The presence of the '/cgi-bin/mft/manufacture' script accessible via the hardcoded credentials acts as a backdoor, potentially allowing unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access Control Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the intended authentication mechanism and access the '/cgi-bin/mft/manufacture' script.
*   **Potentially Unspecified Actions:** The impact is further dependent on the functionality of the '/cgi-bin/mft/manufacture' script which was not analyzed in this report.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network access to the camera's web interface.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker can directly request the '/cgi-bin/mft/manufacture' script with the hardcoded credentials via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the camera.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker must know the hardcoded credentials (manufacture:erutcafunam).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory suggests the camera hardware may be a modified version of a Zavio board.
*   The vulnerability was found in firmware version LM.1.6.16.05.
*   The vendor was notified but did not respond or release updates to fix the issue.
*   The report references previous analysis of the manufacture CGI executable by Core Security/Francisco Falcon.
