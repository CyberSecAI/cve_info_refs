{
  "CVE-2017-7559": {
    "Root cause": "The fix for CVE-2017-2666 was incomplete, and invalid characters were still permitted in the query string and path parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete fix for HTTP request smuggling vulnerability",
       "Permitting invalid characters in the request"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could inject data into the HTTP response by exploiting the incomplete fix for CVE-2017-2666,  potentially leading to web-cache poisoning, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or the exposure of sensitive information from other user requests.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending HTTP requests with crafted query strings or path parameters containing invalid characters that are interpreted differently by the server and a proxy.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests and knowledge of the target system. They also need to identify a proxy that interprets the crafted requests differently than the server to exploit this vulnerability"
  }
