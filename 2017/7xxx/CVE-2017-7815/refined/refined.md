Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of the `showModalDialog` JavaScript method in Firefox when the e10s multiprocess feature is turned off. This method, when used within an iframe with a `data:` protocol, allows the creation of a modal dialog that can spoof its origin by displaying an arbitrary domain in the dialog's location bar.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Domain Spoofing:** The primary weakness is the ability to spoof the origin of a modal dialog, making it appear as if the dialog is from a different, potentially legitimate domain. This can mislead users.
*   **`showModalDialog` Method:** The use of this method is the root of the issue, as it is not properly isolated or restricted in its non-e10s implementation.
*   **Lack of e10s Protection:** The vulnerability is only present in Firefox installations that do not have e10s (multi-process) enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing/Credential Theft:** An attacker could use this to create a fake login prompt that appears to be from a legitimate website, potentially stealing user credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:** As illustrated in the bug report, an attacker could use this to download a file from an unauthorized domain, potentially installing malware.
*  **User Deception**: The modal dialog can be used to display misleading content which could trick users into performing unwanted actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Iframe with data:** An attacker can embed an iframe with `data:` protocol within a webpage.
*   **JavaScript Code:** The attacker must use Javascript code to execute `showModalDialog` method, which displays the arbitrary modal dialog.
*   **User interaction:** User interaction is required, the user must click a button to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a webpage:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage with the malicious iframe and Javascript code.
*   **Target user with non-e10s Firefox:** The attack is specific to Firefox installations without e10s enabled.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was mitigated by removing the `showModalDialog` method from Firefox in bug 981796, as it is not supported with e10s.
This method is behind a preference and was removed shortly after.
This issue is resolved in Firefox 56 and later versions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is related to CVE-2017-7791, which addresses similar spoofing issues with native JavaScript popup dialogs (confirm/alert/prompt).
*   The vulnerability is considered a moderate severity issue.
*   This was reported by an external reporter and qualified for a security bounty.
