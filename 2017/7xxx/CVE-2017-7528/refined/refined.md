Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7528:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `X-Forwarded-For` header in Ansible Tower.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Header Injection:** The `X-Forwarded-For` header, which is typically used to identify the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer, is not being properly validated or sanitized by Ansible Tower. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values into this header.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Internal Server Deployment:** By manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` header, an attacker can trick internal servers into deploying systems using callbacks, potentially gaining unauthorized access to internal infrastructure or triggering malicious actions on other systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header in requests sent to the Ansible Tower.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Ansible Tower server.
- **Header Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` header within the HTTP request.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was acknowledged by Alberto Gonzalez (Red Hat).
- The bug was reported by Adam Mari≈° on 2017-06-30.
- The vulnerability is related to the improper handling of the X-Forwarded-For header and its potential to influence internal server deployments via callbacks.
