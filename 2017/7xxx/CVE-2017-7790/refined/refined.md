Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way the crash reporter on Windows handles registry values. Specifically, it uses the `RegQueryValueEx` function to read string values from the registry. If the registry value is not null-terminated, the crash reporter copies data from stack memory until a null terminator is found.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Null Termination:** The primary weakness is that the code does not ensure that strings read from the registry are null-terminated. The `RegQueryValueEx` function can return strings that are not null-terminated, and the crash reporter does not account for this.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** If a non-null-terminated string is read from the registry, the crash reporter's code will read beyond the intended buffer on the stack.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The stack memory read can contain private data from the local system, such as eip values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the stack by crafting a registry value that is not null-terminated, and leveraging the crash reporter's read past the intended buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Registry Value:** An attacker would need to manipulate a specific registry key to contain a string value without a null terminator.
*   **Triggering Crash:** The attacker needs to cause a crash on the system to trigger the crash reporter and its vulnerable code path, and thus trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have write access to the Windows Registry and the ability to cause a crash.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only affects Windows systems.
*   The affected code is in the crash reporter client, which runs when the Firefox process has crashed, not the Firefox binary itself, which makes exploitation harder.

The provided bugzilla entry ([Bug 1350460](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1350460)) provides more technical detail about the vulnerable code and the fix, which involves ensuring that registry values are properly null-terminated before being copied into the crash reporter.
