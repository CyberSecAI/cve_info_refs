User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/37.0.2062.124 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Prepare a web server sending two more STS headers via valid https connection.
2. Access to the page from Firefox.
Actual results:
HSTS is not enabled.
Reproduction environment is here.
1) Launch following URL for receiving two STS headers.
<https://alice.csrf.jp/hsts/>
2) Launch following link, then HSTS is not enabled.
<http://alice.csrf.jp/>
Expected results:
Section 8.1 of HSTS spec (RFC 6797) requires following process to the UA.
If a UA receives more than one STS header field in an HTTP
response message over secure transport, then the UA MUST process
only the first such header field.
It seems that Firefox violates the mandatory spec RFC requires.
If one STS header is set by web app. and the other one is set by web server or some sort of network equipment, then, HSTS is not enabled on Firefox.

The error firefox shows on the console is that "The site specified an invalid Strict-Transport-Security header". So we're rejecting it because we think it's invalid rather than because there are two of them.
Since proxies are allowed to coalesce headers we should probably expect that syntax.Component: Untriaged → DOM: SecurityProduct: Firefox → Core

<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpChannel.cpp#1112>
Looks like we don't do anything to properly handle combined duplicate headers (where two instances of a header are comma-joined). IIRC, the HSTS spec says "ignore all but the first header", which means to strip everything after a comma when parsing the header value. We should make sure we conform to whatever the HPKP spec says about this too.
Should be an easy fix to do like we did for CSP but maybe ignore subsequent values instead of using them all (<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/base/src/nsDocument.cpp#2735>).

My understanding is that necko concatenates headers with the same name as a comma-separated list. However, from RFC 2616 section 4.2[0]:
"Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)]. It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each separated by a comma. The order in which header fields with the same field-name are received is therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy MUST NOT change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded."
Since the field-value for HSTS is not defined as a comma-separated list and since doing this does change the semantics of the message (by resulting in an invalid HSTS header), this concatenation shouldn't be happening.

Looks like this will probably require two changes if we want to stop the merging in Necko:
1. Add HSTS to the list of headers that are singletons (not-merged)
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpHeaderArray.h#122>
2. Verify nsHttpHeaderArray::SetHeaderFromNet() does the right thing, via some HSTS test:

that's not a valid http response wrt 6797.. so I'm not sure this is even an outright bug. 7230 clarifies that the sender cannot send 2 headers with the same name if they cannot be combined into a comma-list syntax and STS isn't defined that way. (it also mentions that happens with set-cookie all the time :))
so what necko is doing (the combining) is totally legal - clarified by 7230. (we're a receiver, not a sender in this case) <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2>
So just be aware that some other intermediary might do the combination even if necko doesn't - by the same logic. (yes its https, but reverse proxies and the like are still presnet) - so having the parser drop things at the comma seems like something you should do in addition to having gecko not combine things. either that or throw an error.
you can prevent merging in necko and drop the non-first ones by adding it to the IsSingletonHeader list - sid is right.
don't add it to the SuspectDuplicateHeader list unless you want to throw an error when this happens.Flags: needinfo?(mcmanus)

Thanks for the ping. This is more of a polish bug - Gecko is behaving correctly according to the various specifications (see [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1074642#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox ignores Strict-Transport-Security when two more STS headers are sent from server") and [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1074642#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox ignores Strict-Transport-Security when two more STS headers are sent from server")). We could attempt to detect this and give a more helpful error message in the console.Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

[Bug 1074642 - When multiple HSTS headers are received, only consider the first.](attachment.cgi?id=8860042)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8860042&action=edit)

This implements a plaintext reading of RFC 6797, which says to only consider the first, however it slightly conflicts with RFC 7230, which says that sending multiple headers which can't be merged is illegal (except for a specific whitelist which HSTS isn't in). Chrome also implements HSTS using RFC 6797's description of the parsing algorithm.

I've uploaded a review that implements the plaintext RFC 6797 algorithm for handling multiple HSTS headers (namely: drop all but the first); however this needs a unit test! I'd be appreciating if someone could point me to the right place to add a C++ unit test.Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

Hmmm - I'm probably not the best person to ask about necko unit tests (I imagine :mcmanus would be, although this looks relevant: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/test/unit/test_duplicate_headers.js> ). If you wanted an integration test for this, I would add a new test to <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/ssl/tests/mochitest/stricttransportsecurity> (or just extend one of the preexisting ones).Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

I'm not a necko peer, so I'm not very familiar with this code. In any case, looks good to me from a code perspective, for what it's worth.
From a philosophical point of view, I'm still on the fence about changing this behavior. I feel like if a server is sending multiple HSTS headers, something is wrong and we don't wait to aid in it shooting itself in the foot. For example, say a server is initially configured to send "includeSubdomains", but then does some processing and figures out that it doesn't actually want to include subdomains because some of them don't support https. So, it adds a new header thinking it will overwrite the first one. Firefox sees both headers, discards the second one, and thinks that the domain's subdomains should be considered HSTS as well. Now the site is broken because some resources on subdomains can't be fetched because they're being upgraded to https when they shouldn't be. I think if multiple headers that have the same value are seen it would be fine to discard the copies, but not so much if there's conflicting information. Thoughts?

I understand this makes it more spec compliant - but the spec is really not good here. If this is a singleton and there are multiple copies of the header possible you're looking at a potential security hole if something can influence the header order (via smuggling or something else) if you do anything other than reject it.
the normal approach for duplicated singletons is to allow it iff they are all the same (which seems to be a common and harmless failure mode) and otherwise throw CORRUPTED\_CONTENT in the case of Content-Length, though in this case I think ignoring the hsts directive would be fine.
but I'm going to r+ it cause the code seems ok and this is more of a decision for the security team on how tight they want to comply. I don't think I would do it if it were up to me.

Right now such a site would already be broken in Chrome and Safari, so I don't think Firefox being a holdout on this behavior really helps developers not footgun themselves, it just makes it harder for them to debug, or risk losing the security wins of HSTS for Firefox users.
I don't have super strong feelings on whether 6797 is good or bad, but I think agreeing on one behavior for The Web (tm) which matches the RFC is the best thing for developers, because it makes debugging easier.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1350460#c0)• 8 years ago |
|  | |

In toolkit\crashreporter\client\crashreporter\_win.cpp, function GetStringValue, a Windows registry value is queried. If the type is REG\_SZ (i.e. a string), it copies the content of a wchar\_t stack buffer to a wstring object, which is returned to the caller.
However, in Microsoft's document [1], it warns us:
> If the data has the REG\_SZ, REG\_MULTI\_SZ or REG\_EXPAND\_SZ type,
> the string may not have been stored with the proper terminating
> null characters. Therefore, even if the function returns ERROR\_SUCCESS,
> the application should ensure that the string is properly terminated
> before using it; otherwise, it may overwrite a buffer.
In our case, because we don't prefill the |buf| with all-zero, suppose the data we read is not null-terminated, then the wstring will contain the stack memory data (which may include old eip value), until it reaches a NULL.
Whether this issue is exploitable depends on how the caller uses the wstring object and what registry value it queries. But no matter what, not ensuring the string is null-terminated is problematic.
The doc suggests to use RegGetValue function.

And there are a lots of others, like:
\* xpcom\io\SpecialSystemDirectory.cpp: GetRegWindowsAppDataFolder: |path| may not be null-terminated, and thus
int len = wcslen(path);
may not give right value.
After that,
path[len] = L'\\';
may overwrite a 2-byte memory at unintended address.
I will search it more thoroughly if you confirm this is a vulnerability.

Thank you, Gabriele! But I think there is still a small problem: if RegQueryValueEx copies exactly 2048 wide chars to |buf| and it is not null-terminated, then constructing wstring will still over-read.
This can be fixed by setting dataSize = sizeof(buf) - 1; which ensures buf has at least one \0 at the end.

Nice catch, I hadn't thought of that, updated patch coming.

Actually I had filed [Bug 1348843](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348843 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - uninitialized local variable in GetRegWindowsAppDataFolder function") for the uninitialized parameter issue. I didn't realized this null-terminated string issue back then. Do need to merge that bug to this one?

Yes, there's no point in clearing the string if we leave that parameter uninitialized.

FWIW this seems pretty unlikely to be exploitable given that we only query two fixed registry keys ("Software\\Mozilla\\Crash Reporter" and possibly "Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell Folders" if SHGetFolderPath fails).
Additionally, this code is in the crashreporter client which only runs when the entire Firefox process has crashed, not the Firefox binary itself.
Thanks for the bug report!

Doesn't seem worth backporting given [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1350460#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-null-terminated strings in crashreporter_win.cpp may potentially disclose memory") and [comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=1350460#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-null-terminated strings in crashreporter_win.cpp may potentially disclose memory"). Feel free to set things back to affected and request approval if you feel otherwise, though.
