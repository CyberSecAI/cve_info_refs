Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Hashicorp vagrant-vmware-fusion plugin uses a "sudo helper" binary to execute an encoded Ruby script with elevated privileges.
*   The sudo helper executes the Ruby script using `system("ruby <script path>")` without verifying the script's path or sanitizing the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure path handling:** The sudo helper does not validate the path to the Ruby script it executes.
*   **PATH variable manipulation:** The sudo helper does not scrub or sanitize the `PATH` environment variable, which can be manipulated to point to a malicious `ruby` executable.
*   **Setuid binary:** The sudo helper binary is made suid root, meaning it executes with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain root privileges on the system by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** An attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Malicious script injection:** An attacker needs to create a malicious script and modify the PATH variable such that the malicious script will be executed instead of the legitimate Ruby script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account on the target macOS system.
*   The attacker must have the Hashicorp vagrant-vmware-fusion plugin installed.
*   The attacker needs to be able to write files to the filesystem.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the vagrant-vmware-fusion plugin prior to 4.0.21.
*   The provided exploit script targets macOS 64-bit, but other architectures are also likely vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability was acknowledged by Hashicorp on 08/04/17 and fixed on 14/07/17.
*   The vendor was responsive and paid a bounty for the disclosure.
