**Vulnerable App:**

```
I'm a big fan of Hashicorp but this is an awful bug to have in software of their
calibre.

Their vagrant plugin for vmware fusion uses a product called Ruby Encoder to
protect their proprietary ruby code.  It does this by turning the ruby code into
bytecode and executing it directly.

Unfortunately the execution chain necessary for this to work is not safe.  After
installing the plugin, the first time you "vagrant up" any vagrant file using
vmware fusion it will create some files in
~/.vagrant.d/gems/2.2.5/gems/vagrant-vmware-fusion-4.0.18/bin:

vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper
vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper_wrapper_darwin_386
vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper_wrapper_darwin_amd64
vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper_wrapper_linux_386
vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper_wrapper_linux_amd64

The first one is an encoded ruby script, the others are "sudo helper" binaries
for the different platforms supported by the plugin.  Of these sudo helpers,
the one that corresponds to your platform will be made suid root when vagrant up
is run.

Unfortunately the helper calls the ruby script with system("ruby <script path>")
- i.e. it doesn't verify the path to the ruby script and it doesn't scrub the
PATH variable either.  We can easily exploit this to get root.

Hashicorp were quick to respond and kindly paid me a small bounty for my trouble.

The issue was acknowledged by Hashicorp on 08/04/17 and fixed on 14/07/17.

The exploit below is for darwin 64bit but it's likely other architectures are
also vulnerable.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

* core: Check IP address returned from vmrun and discard if invalid
* core: Support linked clones

## 4.0.15 (November 28, 2016)

* core: properly load in Vagrant versions >= 1.9.0

## 4.0.14 (October 14, 2016)

* linux/shared\_folders: Only emit upstart event on mount if upstart is in use.
* linux/shared\_folders: Update hgfs mount strategy for open-vm-tools to properly
  handle symlink usage.
  (See: [hashicorp/vagrant#7599](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7599) [hashicorp/vagrant#5474](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5474))
* linux/shared\_folders: Automatically unmount `/mnt/hgfs` if present on guest. Include
  configuration option to disable (`config.vm.unmount_default_hgfs = false`).

## 4.0.13 (September 30, 2016)

* core: fix setuid usage within sudo wrapper.
  (See: [hashicorp/vagrant#7839](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7839))

## 4.0.7 (February 8, 2016)

* core: correct default for `verify_vmnet` boolean provider config option. In
  4.0.6 it was incorrectly defaulted to `false`. It now defaults to `true`.

## 4.0.6 (January 6, 2016)

* core: add `verify_vmnet` boolean provider config option. Disabling vmnet device verification might in some cases allow Vagrant to boot machines in a mostly-working state, skipping checks that would proactively bail out. This is an advanced option for which HashiCorp can only provide limited support.

## 4.0.4 (December 21, 2015)

* core: perform a normal VM clone if the linked clone fails - this
  accounts for the case where the user does not have a VMware
  product that supports linked clones (such as the non-PRO versions)

## 4.0.3 (December 14, 2015)

* core: run provisioner cleanup tasks
* core: add support for encoding on Ruby 2.1 and 2.2

## 4.0.2 (October 12, 2015)

  (ctrl + c)
* workstation: fix a bug that would cause an exception to be printed
  when the version of Workstation was newer than what the license
  permitted

## 4.0.1 (August 25, 2015)

* workstation: fix for version parsing code preventing the plugin from
  booting with Workstation 12 on Windows

## 4.0.0 (August 25, 2015)

* fusion: enable Fusion 8 support with valid license
* workstation: enable Workstation 12 with valid license

## 3.2.12 (August 17, 2015)

* core: Increase retries when looking up guest IP address for communicator
  info from 5 to 10. We continue to do linear backoff, meaning we'll wait for
  up to 55 seconds for an IP to be available.

## 3.2.11 (July 29, 2015)

* hgfs: fall back to legacy `:group` behavior when `getent` based lookup
  does not succeed

## 3.2.10 (July 27, 2015)

* core: adjust timeout to 45 seconds and raise a more human-friendly error
* core: do not error when trying to destroy a non-created VM
* core: allow users to use `VAGRANT_VMWARE_FUSION_EXP` for experimental VMware
  Fusion support again

## 3.2.9 (June 17, 2015)

* hgfs: fix an issue with the `:group` option of HGFS `synced_folder`s, which
  was causing it to only work with group names that were also usernames.

## 3.2.8 (June 1, 2015)

* nat\_conf: detect and repair a type of nat conf corruption caused by certain
  combinations of previously released versions of VMware, Vagrant, and the
  Vagrant VMware plugin (See: [hashicorp/vagrant#5600](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5600))

## 3.2.7 (May 29, 2015)

* core: fix public networks with static ips; they were incorrectly being marked
  as `type: :dhcp`, causing the assigned IP not to be respected
* synced\_folders: improve error message when ssh info cannot be determined

## 3.2.6 (March 23, 2015)

* nfs: modify the strategy for choosing the guest / host IP address for NFS
  configuration to avoid issues selecting the proper IP address when using
  NFS synced\_folders with private\_networks

## 3.2.5 (March 23, 2015)

* workstation-linux: properly reconfigure host `vmnet` devices; fixes
  incorrect VMware configs being generated when Vagrant needed to add a
  network device to the host.

## 3.2.4 (February 26, 2015)

* workstation-windows: fix another port-forwarding bug causing issues with
  port collisions on subsequent boots

## 3.2.3 (February 17, 2015)

* core: additional sanity checks during box clone

## 3.2.2 (February 12, 2015)

* synced\_folders: revert symlink-specific code; recent versions of Fusion and
  Workstation handle symlinks properly without any additional configuration;
  incorporating workaround docs for users on older versions of VMWare
  software that have trouble with symlinks
* workstation-windows: fix slash mismatch preventing multi-vm port forwarding
  from working properly

## 3.2.1 (February 6, 2015)

* core: (OS X) fall back to sudo if osascript-based privilege escalation
  for installing `sudo_helper` fails for any reason
* fusion,workstation: fix addSharedFolder side-effect causing symlinks to
  become disabled when multiple shared folders are used
* fusion,workstation: new provider config `enable_vmrun_ip_lookup`, defaults
  to `true`, allows `vmrun getGuestIpAddress` to be manually skipped to
