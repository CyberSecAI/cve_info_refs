# AIRTAME security issues

End of november 2016 I took a look at the
[AIRTAME](http://airtame.com/) wireless presentation
HDMI dongle's internal software and found some security issues
with Firmware version 2.1.1.
[​](#p1)

Many of the configuration URLs allow unauthenticated access, even
when a device control management password is set.
It is possible to read out all configuration including the Wi-Fi password,
overwrite all settings.
Everyone may change the firmware update channel
(alpha/beta/ga),
start a firmware upgrade or re-enable disabled Wifi networks.
[​](#p2)

I reported the issues on 2016-11-25 and got a response 4 days later.
On 2016-12-05 I got the confirmation that those issues would be fixed
in the upcoming version 2.2 of the firmware.
[​](#p3)

## Details[​](#details)

### Changing settings[​](#settings)

Everyone is able to change settings by sending
parameters in the correct format to bin/save\_settings.php,
despite that a device control management password is set.
[​](#settings-p1)

The reason is that /bin/save\_settings.php does not check for
authentication because the authentication handler is *commented out*:
[​](#settings-p2)

```
<?php
# require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . "/authentication_handler.php");[​](#settings-c1)
```
### Update channel[​](#channel)

By sending a HTTP request to bin/change\_update\_channel.php,
you may switch the update channel to alpha/beta/ga. Unauthenticated.
[​](#channel-p1)

### Start an update[​](#update)

By calling bin/update.php, the update process is started.
In combination with change\_update\_channel,
this lets anyone install a new version during a running presentation.
Unauthenticated.
[​](#update-p1)

### Re-enable wifi networks[​](#wifi)

bin/disconnect.php lets one re-enable disabled wifi networks.
Unauthenticated.
[​](#wifi-p1)

### Diagnostics report[​](#report)

bin/report.php generates a zip file with diagnostics data.
It contains detailled report about the device, including the password of
the wifi network that the airtame is connected with
(device-networks.txt -> wifi password in "psk").
Unauthenticated.
[​](#report-p1)

device-manager.txt in that report contains all settings that
were successfully protected in bin/get\_config.php.
[​](#report-p2)

### Redirecting the dashboard[​](#launch)

bin/launchapp.php uses the port given as parameter
plus the IP address from the requestor, and uses that as
HTTP URL as dashboard content.
[​](#launch-p1)

This lets me navigate to any port on my machine, on which I can run a
HTTP server that redirects the airtame to a Donald Trump video page.
Unauthenticated.
[​](#launch-p2)

### Sending diagnostics[​](#senddiag)

Calling bin/send\_diagnostics.php lets anyone send the report
to Airtame Inc.
[​](#senddiag-p1)

### More[​](#more)

There are more unprotected admin scripts, but those listed above are
the ones people can do the most interesting things with
[​](#more-p1)

## Terms of Services[​](#tos)

The Airtame [Terms Of Services](https://airtame.com/terms)
define the HDMI dongle ("product") as being part of their "services".
[​](#tos-p1)

> These Terms of Service [...]
> governs your access to and use of our Website, mobile application,
> Platform, Product, software, and services (collectively, the “Services”),
> and any Content.
> [​](#tos-p2)
>
> [​](#tos-q1)

When inspecting the Airtame's code, I broke their ToS
which flat out did not allow some parts of my work (5.2)
or require written permission for others (5.3).
[​](#tos-p3)

> **5.2 Tampering.**
> [​](#tos-p4)
>
> You may not use the Services in a way that is detrimental
> to the operation of the Services or the access or use of
> the Services by anyone else.
> You will not upload or transmit viruses, worms or any other
> destructive code.
> The restriction in this Section 3(f)(ii) applies to any use that interferes
> or attempts to interfere with the normal operations of the Services,
> including by hacking, deleting, augmenting or altering the Services
> or any Content.
> [​](#tos-p5)
>
> [​](#tos-q1)

I found an issue that lets the dashboard display content from my
own machine, which I see as "alterting any Content".
[​](#tos-p6)

> **5.3 Permission Required.**
> [​](#tos-p7)
>
> You may not, without Airtame’s prior written permission
> [​](#tos-p8)
>
> 1. copy, distribute, modify, enhance, translate, reproduce, sell, resell,
>    sublicense, rent, lease, or otherwise attempt to exploit the Services;
>    [​](#tos-i1)
> 2. decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to
>    discover the source code;
>    [​](#tos-i2)
> 3. make derivative works of the Services; or
>    [​](#tos-i3)
> 4. modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated
>    with the Services, Airtame or any other Airtame products or services.
>    [​](#tos-i4)
>
> [​](#tos-q2)

Since I used SSH to access the HDMI dongle and copied the php files
to my machine, I'm violating 5.3 section B.
Section A was also violated because I exploited security issues
during my research.
[​](#tos-p8)

This is not hacker-friendly at all.
To be legally secure, I should have nobody telling about the issues.
Airtame should really change their ToS.
[​](#tos-p9)

And I do not own the dongle because I cannot do everything I want with it.
Very sad.
[​](#tos-p10)

## Fin[​](#fin)

The airtame forum has
[a small discussion](http://forum.airtame.com/t/airtame-security-assessment/3199)
about this and other security problems.
[​](#fin-p1)

[CVE ID](https://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#what_is_cve_identifier):
[CVE-2017-7450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7450)
[​](#fin-p2)

## Others[​](#others)

[Utku Sen](https://utkusen.com/) found more vulnerabilities
and reported them to Airtame.
They will be disclosed when their 3.0.0 software is out.
He got a "thank you" package from Airtame:

> Handwritten thank you note and a team photo are better than all
> kind of bounties! Thanks @airtame
