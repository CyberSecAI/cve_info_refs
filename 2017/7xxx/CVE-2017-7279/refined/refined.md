Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-7279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how session tokens are handled within the Unitrends web interface. Specifically, session tokens are tied to the IP address and remain valid indefinitely as long as requests originate from the same IP.
*   The token itself is a base64 encoded string with colon separated values, one of which is the user ID (UID).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Session Handling:** Session tokens do not expire and are indefinitely valid as long as requests originate from the same IP.
*   **Lack of UID Validation:** The application does not properly validate the user ID (UID) within the session token.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The UID is directly used to control access to resources, without proper checks to ensure the user has the correct privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can modify the UID within their session token to a higher-privileged user ID (e.g., UID 1 for root), gaining complete control over the web application and access to all resources, effectively escalating privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the Unitrends web interface.
*   **Session Token Manipulation:** The attacker must obtain a valid session token, decode it, modify the UID, re-encode it, and then use the modified token in their requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account, including low-privilege access.
*   The attacker must have the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, including cookies and headers.
*   The attacker needs a basic understanding of URL encoding and base64 encoding.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content explains that the token is base64 and URL encoded and consists of colon separated values.
*   The format is identified as v0:$SESSION_KEY:$UID:$LOG_FILE_PATH:$LOG_LEVEL
*   The content notes that the log file path can be manipulated and an arbitrary file can be overwritten
*   The vulnerability is present in Unitrends versions prior to 9.0.0.
