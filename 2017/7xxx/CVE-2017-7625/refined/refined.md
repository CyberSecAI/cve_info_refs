  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `save_file.php` script of Fiyo CMS, which allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated file upload vulnerability in `/dapur/apps/app_theme/libs/save_file.php`.",
    "Lack of input validation on the filename.",
    "Lack of checks on the content of the uploaded file allowing to inject malicious code."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, leading to a full compromise of the web server.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `/dapur/apps/app_theme/libs/save_file.php` with crafted `content` and `src` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Fiyo CMS instance and requires no prior authentication."
