Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-7153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how WebKit handles redirect responses to 401 Unauthorized status codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a logic error in URL display, specifically when dealing with redirect responses to 401 Unauthorized. This allows a malicious website to display the lock icon incorrectly, even on mixed content pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to user interface (UI) spoofing. Specifically, a malicious website can incorrectly display the lock icon on mixed content pages, potentially misleading the user into believing the connection is secure when it is not.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a user visiting a malicious website that triggers a redirect to a 401 Unauthorized page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to host a malicious website and trick the victim into visiting it through some means. No specific network position is mentioned, but the attacker needs to be able to cause the victim's web browser to load the malicious content.
