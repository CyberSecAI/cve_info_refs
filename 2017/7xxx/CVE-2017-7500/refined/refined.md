  "CVE-2017-7500": {
    "description": "It was found that rpm did not properly handle RPM installations when a destination path was a symbolic link to a directory, possibly changing ownership and permissions of an arbitrary directory, and RPM files being placed in an arbitrary destination. An attacker, with write access to a directory in which a subdirectory will be installed, could redirect that directory to an arbitrary location and gain root privilege.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from rpm's improper handling of symbolic links to directories during package installation. Specifically, rpm would follow these symlinks and operate on the target directory instead of the symlink itself, leading to potential privilege escalation and arbitrary file placement.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of symbolic links",
      "Privilege escalation vulnerability",
      "Arbitrary file placement"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with write access to a directory could create a symbolic link that redirects a subdirectory installation to an arbitrary location, potentially gaining root privileges by placing files in privileged directories or modifying their ownership and permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs write access to a directory where a subdirectory installation is going to occur. The attacker then replaces the subdirectory with a symbolic link.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to write to a directory where RPM is about to create a subdirectory and then replace that with a symlink."
