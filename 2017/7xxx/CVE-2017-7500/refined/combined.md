Make verification match the new restricted directory symlink behavior

```
Only follow directory symlinks owned by target directory owner or root
during verification to match the behavior of fsmVerify() in the new
[CVE-2017-7500](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jc3-8rq8-7x2x "CVE-2017-7500") world order.

The code is klunkier than it should and the logic should use common code
with fsmVerify() instead of duplicating it here, but that needs more
changes than is comfortable to backport so starting with this.

Also worth noting that the previous "follow the link" logic from
commit [3ccd774](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/3ccd774255b8215733e0bdfdf5a683da9dd10923) was not quite right,
it'd fail with RPMVERIFY_LSTATFAIL on a broken symlink when it should've
ran verification on the symlink itself. This behavior is fixed here too.

Finally, once again fakechroot gets in the way and forces the related
verify testcase to be changed to be able to create a valid link. Reuse
the replacement testcase for the purpose and add another case for
verifying an invalid link.
```

Restrict following symlinks to directories by ownership ([CVE-2017-7500](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jc3-8rq8-7x2x "CVE-2017-7500"))

[Browse files](/rpm-software-management/rpm/tree/f2d3be2a8741234faaa96f5fd05fdfdc75779a79)

```
Only follow directory symlinks owned by target directory owner or root.
This prevents privilege escalation from user-writable directories via
directory symlinks to privileged directories on package upgrade, while
still allowing admin to arrange disk usage with symlinks.

The rationale is that if you can create symlinks owned by user X you *are*
user X (or root), and if you also own directory Y you can do whatever with
it already, including change permissions. So when you create a symlink to
that directory, the link ownership acts as a simple stamp of authority that
you indeed want rpm to treat this symlink as it were the directory that
you own. Such a permission can only be given by you or root, which
is just the way we want it. Plus it's almost ridiculously simple as far
as rules go, compared to trying to calculate something from the
source vs destination directory permissions etc.

In the normal case, the user arranging diskspace with symlinks is indeed
root so nothing changes, the only real change here is to links created by
non-privileged users which should be few and far between in practise.
Unfortunately our test-suite runs as a regular user via fakechroot and
thus the testcase for this fails under the new rules. Adjust the testcase
to get the ownership straight and add a second case for the illegal
behavior, basically the same as the old one but with different expectations.

## Description

It was found that rpm did not properly handle RPM installations when a destination path was a symbolic link to a directory, possibly changing ownership and permissions of an arbitrary directory, and RPM files being placed in an arbitrary destination. An attacker, with write access to a directory in which a subdirectory will be installed, could redirect that directory to an arbitrary location and gain root privilege.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-05-12 10:56:33 UTC  ``` It was found that rpm follows symlinks to directories when installling packages which can be leveraged by local attackers to escalate their privileges when next package upgrade happens.  Upstream fix: <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/f2d3be2a8741234faaa96f5fd05fdfdc75779a79>  <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/c815822c8bdb138066ff58c624ae83e3a12ebfa9>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-05-12 10:56:37 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Ludwig Nussel (SUSE)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c3)  Florian Festi    2017-05-16 12:42:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1279319](attachment.cgi?id=1279319&action=diff "Fix issue with directories changing meta data") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1279319&action=edit "Fix issue with directories changing meta data") Fix issue with directories changing meta data  This only addresses half of the issue. RPM clearly should not touch /etc here but instead apply the meta data to the symlink itself.  This does not deal with the issue that rpm installs files at locations directed by altered/newly created symlinks.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c4)  Florian Festi    2017-05-23 15:22:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1281637](attachment.cgi?id=1281637 "Open newly created files with O_EXCL to make sure there is not a symlink already") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1281637&action=edit "Open newly created files with O_EXCL to make sure there is not a symlink already") Open newly created files with O_EXCL to make sure there is not a symlink already   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c5)  Florian Festi    2017-05-23 15:24:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1281638](attachment.cgi?id=1281638 "Add check when reopening hard linked files") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1281638&action=edit "Add check when reopening hard linked files") Add check when reopening hard linked files  If the directory of a hard linked files is writable to a non priviledged user the user could try to replace the hard link with a symolic link during the istallation process and have rpm overwrite an arbitrary file. This check issues an error in this case.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c6)  Florian Festi    2017-05-23 15:25:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1281639](attachment.cgi?id=1281639 "Open existing files with w+ to avoid messing up files if things go wrong.")

The upstream fix is quite different from the patch in [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c3), because rpm really must follow legitimate symlinks to directories, the question is determining what is a legitimate link (and what isn't).   The upstreamed rule is that rpm only follows directory symlinks owned by the target directory owner or root, longer rationale + the patches are here: <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/f2d3be2a8741234faaa96f5fd05fdfdc75779a79> <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/commit/c815822c8bdb138066ff58c624ae83e3a12ebfa9>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c14)  Cedric Buissart    2017-10-26 16:14:38 UTC  ``` Thanks! Obsoleting the attached patch to prevent confusion & adding the links to the bug description.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1450369#c15)  Cedric Buissart    2017-11-02 13:51:41 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
