# Android Security Bulletin—October 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published October 2, 2017 | Updated October 3, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of October 05, 2017 or later
address all of these issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch
level, see [Check & update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

Android partners are notified of all issues at least a month before
publication. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical severity vulnerability in media
framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to
execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google Play Protect mitigations](#mitigations) section
for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and Google Play Protect, which improve the
security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air
update (OTA) and firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[October 2017
Pixel / Nexus Security Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2017-10-01).

## Announcements

* We have launched a new monthly
  [Pixel / Nexus Security
  Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel), which contains information on additional security
  vulnerabilities and functional improvements that are addressed on Pixel and
  Nexus devices. Android device manufacturers may choose to address these
  issues on their devices. See [Common questions and
  answers](#split) for additional information
* Security bulletin acknowledgements are now listed directly in the
  [Android Security
  Acknowledgements](/docs/security/overview/acknowledgements) page.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as
[Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect). These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through [Google Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect) and warns
  users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is
  especially important for users who install apps from outside of Google
  Play.

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check
& update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-10-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-10-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-10-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-10-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-10-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-10-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2017-10-01 security patch level must include all issues
  associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues
  reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2017-10-05 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device / partner security bulletins, such as the
Pixel / Nexus bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android devices.
Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in
device / partner security bulletins are not
required for declaring a security patch level. Android device and chipset
manufacturers are encouraged to document the presence of other fixes on their
devices through their own security websites, such as the
[Samsung](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb),
[LGE](https://lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates.html), or
[Pixel / Nexus](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel)
security bulletins.

**7. Where are the acknowledgements for this bulletin?**

The acknowledgements for this bulletin are directly in the
[Android Security
Acknowledgements](/docs/security/overview/acknowledgements) page.

crypto: algif\_hash - avoid zero-sized array
commit 6207119444595d287b1e9e83a2066c17209698f3 upstream.
With this reproducer:
struct sockaddr\_alg alg = {
.salg\_family = 0x26,
.salg\_type = "hash",
.salg\_feat = 0xf,
.salg\_mask = 0x5,
.salg\_name = "digest\_null",
};
int sock, sock2;
sock = socket(AF\_ALG, SOCK\_SEQPACKET, 0);
bind(sock, (struct sockaddr \*)&alg, sizeof(alg));
sock2 = accept(sock, NULL, NULL);
setsockopt(sock, SOL\_ALG, ALG\_SET\_KEY, "\x9b\xca", 2);
accept(sock2, NULL, NULL);
==== 8< ======== 8< ======== 8< ======== 8< ====
one can immediatelly see an UBSAN warning:
UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in crypto/algif\_hash.c:187:7

It is a correct warning, as hash state is propagated to accept as zero,
but creating a zero-length variable array is not allowed in C.
Fix this as proposed by Herbert -- do "?: 1" on that site. No sizeof or
similar happens in the code there, so we just allocate one byte even
though we do not use the array.

fbcon: Fix vc attr at deinit
commit 8aac7f34369726d1a158788ae8aff3002d5eb528 upstream.
fbcon can deal with vc\_hi\_font\_mask (the upper 256 chars) and adjust
the vc attrs dynamically when vc\_hi\_font\_mask is changed at
fbcon\_init(). When the vc\_hi\_font\_mask is set, it remaps the attrs in
the existing console buffer with one bit shift up (for 9 bits), while
it remaps with one bit shift down (for 8 bits) when the value is
cleared. It works fine as long as the font gets updated after fbcon
was initialized.
However, we hit a bizarre problem when the console is switched to
another fb driver (typically from vesafb or efifb to drmfb). At
switching to the new fb driver, we temporarily rebind the console to
the dummy console, then rebind to the new driver. During the
switching, we leave the modified attrs as is. Thus, the new fbcon
takes over the old buffer as if it were to contain 8 bits chars
(although the attrs are still shifted for 9 bits), and effectively
this results in the yellow color texts instead of the original white
color, as found in the bugzilla entry below.
An easy fix for this is to re-adjust the attrs before leaving the
fbcon at con\_deinit callback. Since the code to adjust the attrs is
already present in the current fbcon code, in this patch, we simply
factor out the relevant code, and call it from fbcon\_deinit().

drm: reference count event->completion
commit 24835e442f289813aa568d142a755672a740503c upstream.
When writing the generic nonblocking commit code I assumed that
through clever lifetime management I can assure that the completion
(stored in drm\_crtc\_commit) only gets freed after it is completed. And
that worked.
I also wanted to make nonblocking helpers resilient against driver
bugs, by having timeouts everywhere. And that worked too.
Unfortunately taking boths things together results in oopses :( Well,
at least sometimes: What seems to happen is that the drm event hangs
around forever stuck in limbo land. The nonblocking helpers eventually
time out, move on and release it. Now the bug I tested all this
against is drivers that just entirely fail to deliver the vblank
events like they should, and in those cases the event is simply
leaked. But what seems to happen, at least sometimes, on i915 is that
the event is set up correctly, but somohow the vblank fails to fire in
time. Which means the event isn't leaked, it's still there waiting for
eventually a vblank to fire. That tends to happen when re-enabling the
pipe, and then the trap springs and the kernel oopses.
The correct fix here is simply to refcount the crtc commit to make
sure that the event sticks around even for drivers which only
sometimes fail to deliver vblanks for some arbitrary reasons. Since
crtc commits are already refcounted that's easy to do.

xen: do not re-use pirq number cached in pci device msi msg data
commit c74fd80f2f41d05f350bb478151021f88551afe8 upstream.
Revert the main part of commit:
af42b8d12f8a ("xen: fix MSI setup and teardown for PV on HVM guests")
That commit introduced reading the pci device's msi message data to see
if a pirq was previously configured for the device's msi/msix, and re-use
that pirq. At the time, that was the correct behavior. However, a
later change to Qemu caused it to call into the Xen hypervisor to unmap
all pirqs for a pci device, when the pci device disables its MSI/MSIX
vectors; specifically the Qemu commit:
c976437c7dba9c7444fb41df45468968aaa326ad
("qemu-xen: free all the pirqs for msi/msix when driver unload")
Once Qemu added this pirq unmapping, it was no longer correct for the
kernel to re-use the pirq number cached in the pci device msi message
data. All Qemu releases since 2.1.0 contain the patch that unmaps the
pirqs when the pci device disables its MSI/MSIX vectors.
This bug is causing failures to initialize multiple NVMe controllers
under Xen, because the NVMe driver sets up a single MSIX vector for
each controller (concurrently), and then after using that to talk to
the controller for some configuration data, it disables the single MSIX
vector and re-configures all the MSIX vectors it needs. So the MSIX
setup code tries to re-use the cached pirq from the first vector
for each controller, but the hypervisor has already given away that
pirq to another controller, and its initialization fails.
This is discussed in more detail at:
https://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2017-01/msg00447.html

scsi: sd: Check for unaligned partial completion
commit c46f09175dabd5dd6a1507f36250bfa734a0156e upstream.
Commit  ("mpt3sas: Force request partial completion
alignment") was not considering the case of commands not operating on
logical block size units (e.g. REQ\_OP\_ZONE\_REPORT and its 64B aligned
partial replies). In this case, forcing alignment of resid to the device
logical block size can break the command result, e.g. in the case of
REQ\_OP\_ZONE\_REPORT, the exact number of zone reported by the device.
Move the partial completion alignement check of mpt3sas to a generic
implementation in sd\_done(). The check is added within the default
section of the initial req\_op() switch case so that the report and reset
zone commands are ignored. In addition, as sd\_done() is not called for
passthrough requests, resid corrections are not done as intended by the
initial mpt3sas patch.

device-dax: fix pmd/pte fault fallback handling
commit 0134ed4fb9e78672ee9f7b18007114404c81e63f upstream.
Jeff Moyer reports:
With a device dax alignment of 4KB or 2MB, I get sigbus when running
the attached fio job file for the current kernel (4.11.0-rc1+). If
I specify an alignment of 1GB, it works.
I turned on debug output, and saw that it was failing in the huge
fault code.
dax dax1.0: dax\_open
dax dax1.0: dax\_mmap
dax dax1.0: dax\_dev\_huge\_fault: fio: write (0x7f08f0a00000 -

[global]
ioengine=dev-dax
direct=0
filename=/dev/dax0.0
bs=2m
[write]

rw=read
The driver fails to fallback when taking a fault that is larger than
the device alignment, or handling a larger fault when a smaller
mapping is already established. While we could support larger
mappings for a device with a smaller alignment, that change is
too large for the immediate fix. The simplest change is to force
fallback until the fault size matches the alignment.

libceph: don't set weight to IN when OSD is destroyed
commit b581a5854eee4b7851dedb0f8c2ceb54fb902c06 upstream.
Since ceph.git commit 4e28f9e63644 ("osd/OSDMap: clear osd\_info,
osd\_xinfo on osd deletion"), weight is set to IN when OSD is deleted.
This changes the result of applying an incremental for clients, not
just OSDs. Because CRUSH computations are obviously affected,
pre-4e28f9e63644 servers disagree with post-4e28f9e63644 clients on
object placement, resulting in misdirected requests.

intel\_th: Don't leak module refcount on failure to activate
commit e609ccef5222c73b46b322be7d3796d60bff353d upstream.
Output 'activation' may fail for the reasons of the output driver,
for example, if msc's buffer is not allocated. We forget, however,
to drop the module reference in this case. So each attempt at
activation in this case leaks a reference, preventing the module
from ever unloading.
This patch adds the missing module\_put() in the activation error
path.

jbd2: don't leak memory if setting up journal fails
commit cd9cb405e0b948363811dc74dbb2890f56f2cb87 upstream.
In journal\_init\_common(), if we failed to allocate the j\_wbuf array, or
if we failed to create the buffer\_head for the journal superblock, we
leaked the memory allocated for the revocation tables. Fix this.

blk-mq: don't complete un-started request in timeout handler
commit 95a49603707d982b25d17c5b70e220a05556a2f9 upstream.
When iterating busy requests in timeout handler,
if the STARTED flag of one request isn't set, that means
the request is being processed in block layer or driver, and
isn't submitted to hardware yet.
In current implementation of blk\_mq\_check\_expired(),
if the request queue becomes dying, un-started requests are
handled as being completed/freed immediately. This way is
wrong, and can cause rq corruption or double allocation[1][2],
when doing I/O and removing&resetting NVMe device at the sametime.
This patch fixes several issues reported by Yi Zhang.

cgroup, net\_cls: iterate the fds of only the tasks which are being migrated
commit a05d4fd9176003e0c1f9c3d083f4dac19fd346ab upstream.
The net\_cls controller controls the classid field of each socket which
is associated with the cgroup. Because the classid is per-socket
attribute, when a task migrates to another cgroup or the configured
classid of the cgroup changes, the controller needs to walk all
sockets and update the classid value, which was implemented by
3b13758f51de ("cgroups: Allow dynamically changing net\_classid").
While the approach is not scalable, migrating tasks which have a lot
of fds attached to them is rare and the cost is born by the ones
initiating the operations. However, for simplicity, both the
migration and classid config change paths call update\_classid() which
scans all fds of all tasks in the target css. This is an overkill for
the migration path which only needs to cover a much smaller subset of
tasks which are actually getting migrated in.
On cgroup v1, this can lead to unexpected scalability issues when one
tries to migrate a task or process into a net\_cls cgroup which already
contains a lot of fds. Even if the migration traget doesn't have many
to get scanned, update\_classid() ends up scanning all fds in the
target cgroup which can be extremely numerous.
Unfortunately, on cgroup v2 which doesn't use net\_cls, the problem is
even worse. Before bfc2cf6f61fc ("cgroup: call subsys->\*attach() only
for subsystems which are actually affected by migration"), cgroup core
would call the ->css\_attach callback even for controllers which don't
see actual migration to a different css.
As net\_cls is always disabled but still mounted on cgroup v2, whenever
a process is migrated on the cgroup v2 hierarchy, net\_cls sees
identity migration from root to root and cgroup core used to call
->css\_attach callback for those. The net\_cls ->css\_attach ends up
calling update\_classid() on the root net\_cls css to which all
processes on the system belong to as the controller isn't used. This
makes any cgroup v2 migration O(total\_number\_of\_fds\_on\_the\_system)
which is horrible and easily leads to noticeable stalls triggering RCU
stall warnings and so on.
The worst symptom is already fixed in upstream by bfc2cf6f61fc
("cgroup: call subsys->\*attach() only for subsystems which are
actually affected by migration"); however, backporting that commit is
too invasive and we want to avoid other cases too.
This patch updates net\_cls's cgrp\_attach() to iterate fds of only the
processes which are actually getting migrated. This removes the
surprising migration cost which is dependent on the total number of
fds in the target cgroup. As this leaves write\_classid() the only
user of update\_classid(), open-code the helper into write\_classid().

cpufreq: Restore policy min/max limits on CPU online
commit ff010472fb75670cb5c08671e820eeea3af59c87 upstream.
On CPU online the cpufreq core restores the previous governor (or
the previous "policy" setting for ->setpolicy drivers), but it does
not restore the min/max limits at the same time, which is confusing,
inconsistent and real pain for users who set the limits and then
suspend/resume the system (using full suspend), in which case the
limits are reset on all CPUs except for the boot one.
Fix this by making cpufreq\_online() restore the limits when an inactive
policy is brought online.
The commit log and patch are inspired from Rafael's earlier work.

arm64: kaslr: Fix up the kernel image alignment
commit afd0e5a876703accb95894f23317a13e2c49b523 upstream.
If kernel image extends across alignment boundary, existing
code increases the KASLR offset by size of kernel image. The
offset is masked after resizing. There are cases, where after
masking, we may still have kernel image extending across
boundary. This eventually results in only 2MB block getting
mapped while creating the page tables. This results in data aborts
while accessing unmapped regions during second relocation (with
kaslr offset) in \_\_primary\_switch. To fix this problem, round up the
kernel image size, by swapper block size, before adding it for
correction.
For example consider below case, where kernel image still crosses
1GB alignment boundary, after masking the offset, which is fixed
by rounding up kernel image size.
SWAPPER\_TABLE\_SHIFT = 30
Swapper using section maps with section size 2MB.
CONFIG\_PGTABLE\_LEVELS = 3
VA\_BITS = 39
\_text : 0xffffff8008080000
\_end : 0xffffff800aa1b000
offset : 0x1f35600000
mask = ((1UL << (VA\_BITS - 2)) - 1) & ~(SZ\_2M - 1)
(\_text + offset) >> SWAPPER\_TABLE\_SHIFT = 0x3fffffe7c
(\_end + offset) >> SWAPPER\_TABLE\_SHIFT = 0x3fffffe7d
offset after existing correction (before mask) = 0x1f37f9b000

ARM: at91: pm: cpu\_idle: switch DDR to power-down mode
commit 60b89f1928af80b546b5c3fd8714a62f6f4b8844 upstream.
On some DDR controllers, compatible with the sama5d3 one,
the sequence to enter/exit/re-enter the self-refresh mode adds
more constrains than what is currently written in the at91\_idle
driver. An actual access to the DDR chip is needed between exit
and re-enter of this mode which is somehow difficult to implement.
This sequence can completely hang the SoC. It is particularly
experienced on parts which embed a L2 cache if the code run
between IDLE calls fits in it...
Moreover, as the intention is to enter and exit pretty rapidly
from IDLE, the power-down mode is a good candidate.
So now we use power-down instead of self-refresh. As we can
simplify the code for sama5d3 compatible DDR controllers,
we instantiate a new sama5d3\_ddr\_standby() function.

Revert "ARM: at91/dt: sama5d2: Use new compatible for ohci node"
commit 9e10889a3177340dcda7d29c6d8fbd97247b007b upstream.
This reverts commit cab43282682e ("ARM: at91/dt: sama5d2: Use new
compatible for ohci node")
It depends from commit 7150bc9b4d43 ("usb: ohci-at91: Forcibly suspend
ports while USB suspend") which was reverted and implemented
differently. With the new implementation, the compatible string must
remain the same.
The compatible string introduced by this commit has been used in the
default SAMA5D2 dtsi starting from Linux 4.8. As it has never been
working correctly in an official release, removing it should not be
breaking the stability rules.

iommu/exynos: Workaround FLPD cache flush issues for SYSMMU v5
commit cd37a296a9f890586665bb8974a8b17ee2f17d6d upstream.
For some unknown reasons, in some cases, FLPD cache invalidation doesn't
work properly with SYSMMU v5 controllers found in Exynos5433 SoCs. This
can be observed by a firmware crash during initialization phase of MFC
video decoder available in the mentioned SoCs when IOMMU support is
enabled. To workaround this issue perform a full TLB/FLPD invalidation
in case of replacing any first level page descriptors in case of SYSMMU v5.

xen/acpi: upload PM state from init-domain to Xen
commit 1914f0cd203c941bba72f9452c8290324f1ef3dc upstream.
This was broken in commit cd979883b9ed ("xen/acpi-processor:
fix enabling interrupts on syscore\_resume"). do\_suspend (from
xen/manage.c) and thus xen\_resume\_notifier never get called on
the initial-domain at resume (it is if running as guest.)
The rationale for the breaking change was that upload\_pm\_data()
potentially does blocking work in syscore\_resume(). This patch
addresses the original issue by scheduling upload\_pm\_data() to
execute in workqueue context.

vfio: Rework group release notifier warning
commit 65b1adebfe43c642dfe3b109edb5d992db5fbe72 upstream.
The intent of the original warning is make sure that the mdev vendor
driver has removed any group notifiers at the point where the group
is closed by the user. Theoretically this would be through an
orderly shutdown where any devices are release prior to the group
release. We can't always count on an orderly shutdown, the user can
close the group before the notifier can be removed or the user task
might be killed. We'd like to add this sanity test when the group is
idle and the only references are from the devices within the group
themselves, but we don't have a good way to do that. Instead check
both when the group itself is removed and when the group is opened.
A bit later than we'd prefer, but better than the current over
aggressive approach.

fscrypt: remove broken support for detecting keyring key revocation
commit 1b53cf9815bb4744958d41f3795d5d5a1d365e2d upstream.
Filesystem encryption ostensibly supported revoking a keyring key that
had been used to "unlock" encrypted files, causing those files to become
"locked" again. This was, however, buggy for several reasons, the most
severe of which was that when key revocation happened to be detected for
an inode, its fscrypt\_info was immediately freed, even while other
threads could be using it for encryption or decryption concurrently.
This could be exploited to crash the kernel or worse.
This patch fixes the use-after-free by removing the code which detects
the keyring key having been revoked, invalidated, or expired. Instead,
an encrypted inode that is "unlocked" now simply remains unlocked until
it is evicted from memory. Note that this is no worse than the case for
block device-level encryption, e.g. dm-crypt, and it still remains
possible for a privileged user to evict unused pages, inodes, and
dentries by running 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches', or by
simply unmounting the filesystem. In fact, one of those actions was
already needed anyway for key revocation to work even somewhat sanely.
This change is not expected to break any applications.
In the future I'd like to implement a real API for fscrypt key
revocation that interacts sanely with ongoing filesystem operations ---
waiting for existing operations to complete and blocking new operations,
and invalidating and sanitizing key material and plaintext from the VFS
caches. But this is a hard problem, and for now this bug must be fixed.
This bug affected almost all versions of ext4, f2fs, and ubifs
encryption, and it was potentially reachable in any kernel configured
with encryption support (CONFIG\_EXT4\_ENCRYPTION=y,
CONFIG\_EXT4\_FS\_ENCRYPTION=y, CONFIG\_F2FS\_FS\_ENCRYPTION=y, or
CONFIG\_UBIFS\_FS\_ENCRYPTION=y). Note that older kernels did not use the
shared fs/crypto/ code, but due to the potential security implications
of this bug, it may still be worthwhile to backport this fix to them.

crypto: ccp - Assign DMA commands to the channel's CCP
commit 7c468447f40645fbf2a033dfdaa92b1957130d50 upstream.
The CCP driver generally uses a round-robin approach when
assigning operations to available CCPs. For the DMA engine,
however, the DMA mappings of the SGs are associated with a
specific CCP. When an IOMMU is enabled, the IOMMU is
programmed based on this specific device.
If the DMA operations are not performed by that specific
CCP then addressing errors and I/O page faults will occur.
Update the CCP driver to allow a specific CCP device to be
requested for an operation and use this in the DMA engine
support.

In the 'commit ebee76f7fa46 ("ath10k: allow setting coverage class")',
it inherits the design and the address offset from ath9k, but the address

ieee80211\_reconfig() when resume() (if the wow is not configured).

mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: fix incorrect timeout clock
commit 16681037e75ce08f2980ac5dbb03414429c7a55d upstream.
sdhci\_arasan\_get\_timeout\_clock() divides the frequency it has with (1 <<
(13 + divisor)).
However, the divisor is not some Arasan-specific value, but instead is
just the Data Timeout Counter Value from the SDHCI Timeout Control
Register.
Applying it here like this is wrong as the sdhci driver already takes
that value into account when calculating timeouts, and in fact it \*sets\*
that register value based on how long a timeout is wanted.
Additionally, sdhci core interprets the .get\_timeout\_clock callback
return value as if it were read from hardware registers, i.e. the unit
should be kHz or MHz depending on SDHCI\_TIMEOUT\_CLK\_UNIT capability bit.
This bit is set at least on the tested Zynq-7000 SoC.
With the tested hardware (SDHCI\_TIMEOUT\_CLK\_UNIT set) this results in
too high a timeout clock rate being reported, causing the core to use
longer-than-needed timeouts. Additionally, on a partitioned MMC
(therefore having erase\_group\_def bit set) mmc\_calc\_max\_discard()
disables discard support as it looks like controller does not support
the long timeouts needed for that.
Do not apply the extra divisor and return the timeout clock in the
expected unit.
Tested with a Zynq-7000 SoC and a partitioned Toshiba THGBMAG5A1JBAWR
eMMC card.

audit: fix auditd/kernel connection state tracking
commit 5b52330bbfe63b3305765354d6046c9f7f89c011 upstream.
What started as a rather straightforward race condition reported by
Dmitry using the syzkaller fuzzer ended up revealing some major
problems with how the audit subsystem managed its netlink sockets and
its connection with the userspace audit daemon. Fixing this properly
had quite the cascading effect and what we are left with is this rather
large and complicated patch. My initial goal was to try and decompose
this patch into multiple smaller patches, but the way these changes
are intertwined makes it difficult to split these changes into
meaningful pieces that don't break or somehow make things worse for
the intermediate states.
The patch makes a number of changes, but the most significant are
highlighted below:
\* The auditd tracking variables, e.g. audit\_sock, are now gone and
replaced by a RCU/spin\_lock protected variable auditd\_conn which is
a structure containing all of the auditd tracking information.
\* We no longer track the auditd sock directly, instead we track it
via the network namespace in which it resides and we use the audit
socket associated with that namespace. In spirit, this is what the
code was trying to do prior to this patch (at least I think that is
what the original authors intended), but it was done rather poorly
and added a layer of obfuscation that only masked the underlying
problems.
\* Big backlog queue cleanup, again. In v4.10 we made some pretty big
changes to how the audit backlog queues work, here we haven't changed
the queue design so much as cleaned up the implementation. Brought
about by the locking changes, we've simplified kauditd\_thread() quite
a bit by consolidating the queue handling into a new helper function,
kauditd\_send\_queue(), which allows us to eliminate a lot of very
similar code and makes the looping logic in kauditd\_thread() clearer.
\* All netlink messages sent to auditd are now sent via
auditd\_send\_unicast\_skb(). Other than just making sense, this makes
the lock handling easier.
\* Change the audit\_log\_start() sleep behavior so that we never sleep
on auditd events (unchanged) or if the caller is holding the
audit\_cmd\_mutex (changed). Previously we didn't sleep if the caller
was auditd or if the message type fell between a certain range; the
type check was a poor effort of doing what the cmd\_mutex check now
does. Richard Guy Briggs originally proposed not sleeping the
cmd\_mutex owner several years ago but his patch wasn't acceptable
at the time. At least the idea lives on here.
\* A problem with the lost record counter has been resolved. Steve
Grubb and I both happened to notice this problem and according to
some quick testing by Steve, this problem goes back quite some time.
It's largely a harmless problem, although it may have left some
careful sysadmins quite puzzled.

powerpc/64s: Fix idle wakeup potential to clobber registers
commit 6d98ce0be541d4a3cfbb52cd75072c0339ebb500 upstream.
We concluded there may be a window where the idle wakeup code could get
to pnv\_wakeup\_tb\_loss() (which clobbers non-volatile GPRs), but the
hardware may set SRR1[46:47] to 01b (no state loss) which would result
in the wakeup code failing to restore non-volatile GPRs.
I was not able to trigger this condition with trivial tests on real
hardware or simulator, but the ISA (at least 2.07) seems to allow for
it, and Gautham says that it can happen if there is an exception pending
when the sleep/winkle instruction is executed.

ext4: mark inode dirty after converting inline directory
commit b9cf625d6ecde0d372e23ae022feead72b4228a6 upstream.
If ext4\_convert\_inline\_data() was called on a directory with inline
data, the filesystem was left in an inconsistent state (as considered by
e2fsck) because the file size was not increased to cover the new block.
This happened because the inode was not marked dirty after i\_disksize
was updated. Fix this by marking the inode dirty at the end of
ext4\_finish\_convert\_inline\_dir().
This bug was probably not noticed before because most users mark the
inode dirty afterwards for other reasons. But if userspace executed
FS\_IOC\_SET\_ENCRYPTION\_POLICY with invalid parameters, as exercised by
'kvm-xfstests -c adv generic/396', then the inode was never marked dirty
after updating i\_disksize.

ppdev: fix registering same device name
commit 9a69645dde1188723d80745c1bc6ee9af2cbe2a7 upstream.
Usually every parallel port will have a single pardev registered with
it. But ppdev driver is an exception. This userspace parallel port
driver allows to create multiple parrallel port devices for a single
parallel port. And as a result we were having a big warning like:
"sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/parport0/ppdev0.0'".
And with that many parallel port printers stopped working.
We have been using the minor number as the id field while registering
a parralel port device with a parralel port. But when there are
multiple parrallel port device for one single parallel port, they all
tried to register with the same name like 'pardev0.0' and everything
started failing.
Use an incremented index as the id instead of the minor number.

iio: hid-sensor-trigger: Change get poll value function order to avoid sensor properties losing after resume from S3
commit 3bec247474469f769af41e8c80d3a100dd97dd76 upstream.
In function \_hid\_sensor\_power\_state(), when hid\_sensor\_read\_poll\_value()
is called, sensor's all properties will be updated by the value from
sensor hardware/firmware.
In some implementation, sensor hardware/firmware will do a power cycle
during S3. In this case, after resume, once hid\_sensor\_read\_poll\_value()
is called, sensor's all properties which are kept by driver during S3
will be changed to default value.
But instead, if a set feature function is called first, sensor
hardware/firmware will be recovered to the last status. So change the
sensor\_hub\_set\_feature() calling order to behind of set feature function
to avoid sensor properties lose.

iio: adc: ti\_am335x\_adc: fix fifo overrun recovery
commit e83bb3e6f3efa21f4a9d883a25d0ecd9dfb431e1 upstream.
The tiadc\_irq\_h(int irq, void \*private) function is handling FIFO
overruns by clearing flags, disabling and enabling the ADC to
recover.
If the ADC is running in continuous mode a FIFO overrun happens
regularly. If the disabling of the ADC happens concurrently with
a new conversion. It might happen that the enabling of the ADC
is ignored by the hardware. This stops the ADC permanently. No
more interrupts are triggered.
According to the AM335x Reference Manual (SPRUH73H October 2011 -
Revised April 2013 - Chapter 12.4 and 12.5) it is necessary to
check the ADC FSM bits in REG\_ADCFSM before enabling the ADC
again. Because the disabling of the ADC is done right after the
current conversion has been finished.
To trigger this bug it is necessary to run the ADC in continuous
mode. The ADC values of all channels need to be read in an endless
loop. The bug appears within the first 6 hours (~5.4 million
handled FIFO overruns). The user space application will hang on
reading new values from the character device.

Sowmini pointed out Dmitry's RTNL deadlock report to me, and it turns out

of the RTNL.
To fix those, change the locking a bit to not be conditional in all those
nl80211\_prepare\_\*\_dump() functions, but make those require the RTNL to
start with, and fix the buggy error paths. This also let me use sparse
(by appropriately overriding the rtnl\_lock/rtnl\_unlock functions) to

USBTMC devices are required to have a bulk-in and a bulk-out endpoint,
but the driver failed to verify this, something which could lead to the
endpoint addresses being taken from uninitialised memory.
Make sure to zero all private data as part of allocation, and add the
missing endpoint sanity check.
Note that this also addresses a more recently introduced issue, where
the interrupt-in-presence flag would also be uninitialised whenever the
optional interrupt-in endpoint is not present. This in turn could lead
to an interrupt urb being allocated, initialised and submitted based on
uninitialised values.

usb-core: Add LINEAR\_FRAME\_INTR\_BINTERVAL USB quirk
commit 3243367b209faed5c320a4e5f9a565ee2a2ba958 upstream.
Some USB 2.0 devices erroneously report millisecond values in
bInterval. The generic config code manages to catch most of them,
but in some cases it's not completely enough.
The case at stake here is a USB 2.0 braille device, which wants to
announce 10ms and thus sets bInterval to 10, but with the USB 2.0
computation that yields to 64ms. It happens that one can type fast
enough to reach this interval and get the device buffers overflown,
leading to problematic latencies. The generic config code does not
catch this case because the 64ms is considered a sane enough value.
This change thus adds a USB\_QUIRK\_LINEAR\_FRAME\_INTR\_BINTERVAL quirk
to mark devices which actually report milliseconds in bInterval,
and marks Vario Ultra devices as needing it.

ALSA: seq: Fix racy cell insertions during snd\_seq\_pool\_done()
commit c520ff3d03f0b5db7146d9beed6373ad5d2a5e0e upstream.
When snd\_seq\_pool\_done() is called, it marks the closing flag to
refuse the further cell insertions. But snd\_seq\_pool\_done() itself
doesn't clear the cells but just waits until all cells are cleared by
the caller side. That is, it's racy, and this leads to the endless
stall as syzkaller spotted.
This patch addresses the racy by splitting the setup of pool->closing
flag out of snd\_seq\_pool\_done(), and calling it properly before
snd\_seq\_pool\_done().

a cleanup, but during cleanup we are not removing the touchpad

net: solve a NAPI race
commit 39e6c8208d7b6fb9d2047850fb3327db567b564b upstream.
While playing with mlx4 hardware timestamping of RX packets, I found
that some packets were received by TCP stack with a ~200 ms delay...
Since the timestamp was provided by the NIC, and my probe was added
in tcp\_v4\_rcv() while in BH handler, I was confident it was not
a sender issue, or a drop in the network.
This would happen with a very low probability, but hurting RPC
workloads.
A NAPI driver normally arms the IRQ after the napi\_complete\_done(),
after NAPI\_STATE\_SCHED is cleared, so that the hard irq handler can grab
it.
Problem is that if another point in the stack grabs NAPI\_STATE\_SCHED bit
while IRQ are not disabled, we might have later an IRQ firing and
finding this bit set, right before napi\_complete\_done() clears it.
This can happen with busy polling users, or if gro\_flush\_timeout is
used. But some other uses of napi\_schedule() in drivers can cause this
as well.
thread 1 thread 2 (could be on same cpu, or not)
// busy polling or napi\_watchdog()
napi\_schedule();
...
napi->poll()
device polling:
read 2 packets from ring buffer
Additional 3rd packet is
available.
device hard irq
// does nothing because
NAPI\_STATE\_SCHED bit is owned by thread 1
napi\_schedule();
napi\_complete\_done(napi, 2);
rearm\_irq();
Note that rearm\_irq() will not force the device to send an additional
IRQ for the packet it already signaled (3rd packet in my example)
This patch adds a new NAPI\_STATE\_MISSED bit, that napi\_schedule\_prep()
can set if it could not grab NAPI\_STATE\_SCHED
Then napi\_complete\_done() properly reschedules the napi to make sure
we do not miss something.
Since we manipulate multiple bits at once, use cmpxchg() like in
sk\_busy\_loop() to provide proper transactions.
In v2, I changed napi\_watchdog() to use a relaxed variant of
napi\_schedule\_prep() : No need to set NAPI\_STATE\_MISSED from this point.
In v3, I added more details in the changelog and clears
NAPI\_STATE\_MISSED in busy\_poll\_stop()
In v4, I added the ideas given by Alexander Duyck in v3 review

genetlink: fix counting regression on ctrl\_dumpfamily()

This subtle change cause that on retry ctrl\_dumpfamily() call we omit
one family that failed to do ctrl\_fill\_info() on previous call, because
cb->args[0] = n number counts also family that failed to do

Patch fixes the problem and avoid confusion in the future just decrease

User visible problem caused by this bug is failure to get access to

socket, bpf: fix sk\_filter use after free in sk\_clone\_lock
[ Upstream commit a97e50cc4cb67e1e7bff56f6b41cda62ca832336 ]
In sk\_clone\_lock(), we create a new socket and inherit most of the
parent's members via sock\_copy() which memcpy()'s various sections.
Now, in case the parent socket had a BPF socket filter attached,
then newsk->sk\_filter points to the same instance as the original
sk->sk\_filter.
sk\_filter\_charge() is then called on the newsk->sk\_filter to take a
reference and should that fail due to hitting max optmem, we bail
out and release the newsk instance.
The issue is that commit 278571baca2a ("net: filter: simplify socket
charging") wrongly combined the dismantle path with the failure path
of xfrm\_sk\_clone\_policy(). This means, even when charging failed, we
call sk\_free\_unlock\_clone() on the newsk, which then still points to
the same sk\_filter as the original sk.
Thus, sk\_free\_unlock\_clone() calls into \_\_sk\_destruct() eventually
where it tests for present sk\_filter and calls sk\_filter\_uncharge()
on it, which potentially lets sk\_omem\_alloc wrap around and releases
the eBPF prog and sk\_filter structure from the (still intact) parent.
Fix it by making sure that when sk\_filter\_charge() failed, we reset
newsk->sk\_filter back to NULL before passing to sk\_free\_unlock\_clone(),
so that we don't mess with the parents sk\_filter.
Only if xfrm\_sk\_clone\_policy() fails, we did reach the point where
either the parent's filter was NULL and as a result newsk's as well
or where we previously had a successful sk\_filter\_charge(), thus for
that case, we do need sk\_filter\_uncharge() to release the prior taken
reference on sk\_filter.

Commit 6ac3ce8295e6 ("net: bcmgenet: Remove excessive PHY reset")
removed the bcmgenet\_mii\_reset() function from bcmgenet\_power\_up() and
bcmgenet\_internal\_phy\_setup() functions. In so doing it broke the reset
of the internal PHY devices used by the GENETv1-GENETv3 which required
this reset before the UniMAC was enabled. It also broke the internal
GPHY devices used by the GENETv4 because the config\_init that installed
the AFE workaround was no longer occurring after the reset of the GPHY
performed by bcmgenet\_phy\_power\_set() in bcmgenet\_internal\_phy\_setup().
In addition the code in bcmgenet\_internal\_phy\_setup() related to the
"enable APD" comment goes with the bcmgenet\_mii\_reset() so it should
have also been removed.
Commit bd4060a6108b ("net: bcmgenet: Power on integrated GPHY in
bcmgenet\_power\_up()") moved the bcmgenet\_phy\_power\_set() call to the
bcmgenet\_power\_up() function, but failed to remove it from the
bcmgenet\_internal\_phy\_setup() function. Had it done so, the
bcmgenet\_internal\_phy\_setup() function would have been empty and could
have been removed at that time.
Commit 5dbebbb44a6a ("net: bcmgenet: Software reset EPHY after power on")
was submitted to correct the functional problems introduced by
commit 6ac3ce8295e6 ("net: bcmgenet: Remove excessive PHY reset"). It
was included in v4.4 and made available on 4.3-stable. Unfortunately,
it didn't fully revert the commit because this bcmgenet\_mii\_reset()
doesn't apply the soft reset to the internal GPHY used by GENETv4 like
the previous one did. This prevents the restoration of the AFE work-
arounds for internal GPHY devices after the bcmgenet\_phy\_power\_set() in
bcmgenet\_internal\_phy\_setup().
This commit takes the alternate approach of removing the unnecessary
bcmgenet\_internal\_phy\_setup() function which shouldn't have been in v4.3
so that when bcmgenet\_mii\_reset() was restored it should have only gone
into bcmgenet\_power\_up(). This will avoid the problems while also
removing the redundancy (and hopefully some of the confusion).

net/mlx5e: Avoid supporting udp tunnel port ndo for VF reps
[ Upstream commit 1ad9a00ae0efc2e9337148d6c382fad3d27bf99a ]
This was added to allow the TC offloading code to identify offloading
encap/decap vxlan rules.
The VF reps are effectively related to the same mlx5 PCI device as the
PF. Since the kernel invokes the (say) delete ndo for each netdev, the
FW erred on multiple vxlan dst port deletes when the port was deleted
from the system.
We fix that by keeping the registration to be carried out only by the
PF. Since the PF serves as the uplink device, the VF reps will look
up a port there and realize if they are ok to offload that.
Tested:
ip link add vxlan1 type vxlan id 44 dev ens5f0 dstport 9999
ip link set vxlan1 up
ip link del dev vxlan1

net: vrf: Reset rt6i\_idev in local dst after put
[ Upstream commit 3dc857f0e8fc22610a59cbb346ba62c6e921863f ]
The VRF driver takes a reference to the inet6\_dev on the VRF device for
its rt6\_local dst when handling local traffic through the VRF device as
a loopback. When the device is deleted the driver does a put on the idev
but does not reset rt6i\_idev in the rt6\_info struct. When the dst is
destroyed, dst\_destroy calls ip6\_dst\_destroy which does a second put for
what is essentially the same reference causing it to be prematurely freed.
Reset rt6i\_idev after the put in the vrf driver.

net: unix: properly re-increment inflight counter of GC discarded candidates
[ Upstream commit 7df9c24625b9981779afb8fcdbe2bb4765e61147 ]
Dmitry has reported that a BUG\_ON() condition in unix\_notinflight()
may be triggered by a simple code that forwards unix socket in an
SCM\_RIGHTS message.
That is caused by incorrect unix socket GC implementation in unix\_gc().
The GC first collects list of candidates, then (a) decrements their
"children's" inflight counter, (b) checks which inflight counters are
now 0, and then (c) increments all inflight counters back.
(a) and (c) are done by calling scan\_children() with inc\_inflight or
dec\_inflight as the second argument.
Commit 6209344f5a37 ("net: unix: fix inflight counting bug in garbage
collector") changed scan\_children() such that it no longer considers
sockets that do not have UNIX\_GC\_CANDIDATE flag. It also added a block
of code that that unsets this flag \_before\_ invoking
scan\_children(, dec\_iflight, ). This may lead to incorrect inflight
counters for some sockets.
This change fixes this bug by changing order of operations:
UNIX\_GC\_CANDIDATE is now unset only after all inflight counters are
restored to the original state.

amd-xgbe: Fix jumbo MTU processing on newer hardware
[ Upstream commit 622c36f143fc9566ba49d7cec994c2da1182d9e2 ]
Newer hardware does not provide a cumulative payload length when multiple
descriptors are needed to handle the data. Once the MTU increases beyond
the size that can be handled by a single descriptor, the SKB does not get
built properly by the driver.
The driver will now calculate the size of the data buffers used by the
hardware. The first buffer of the first descriptor is for packet headers
or packet headers and data when the headers can't be split. Subsequent
descriptors in a multi-descriptor chain will not use the first buffer. The
second buffer is used by all the descriptors in the chain for payload data.
Based on whether the driver is processing the first, intermediate, or last
descriptor it can calculate the buffer usage and build the SKB properly.
Tested and verified on both old and new hardware.

fscrypt: remove broken support for detecting keyring key revocation

```
Filesystem encryption ostensibly supported revoking a keyring key that
had been used to "unlock" encrypted files, causing those files to become
"locked" again.  This was, however, buggy for several reasons, the most
severe of which was that when key revocation happened to be detected for
an inode, its fscrypt_info was immediately freed, even while other
threads could be using it for encryption or decryption concurrently.
This could be exploited to crash the kernel or worse.

This patch fixes the use-after-free by removing the code which detects
the keyring key having been revoked, invalidated, or expired.  Instead,
an encrypted inode that is "unlocked" now simply remains unlocked until
it is evicted from memory.  Note that this is no worse than the case for
block device-level encryption, e.g. dm-crypt, and it still remains
possible for a privileged user to evict unused pages, inodes, and
dentries by running 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches', or by
simply unmounting the filesystem.  In fact, one of those actions was
already needed anyway for key revocation to work even somewhat sanely.
This change is not expected to break any applications.

In the future I'd like to implement a real API for fscrypt key
revocation that interacts sanely with ongoing filesystem operations ---
waiting for existing operations to complete and blocking new operations,
and invalidating and sanitizing key material and plaintext from the VFS
caches.  But this is a hard problem, and for now this bug must be fixed.

This bug affected almost all versions of ext4, f2fs, and ubifs
encryption, and it was potentially reachable in any kernel configured
with encryption support (CONFIG_EXT4_ENCRYPTION=y,
CONFIG_EXT4_FS_ENCRYPTION=y, CONFIG_F2FS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y, or
CONFIG_UBIFS_FS_ENCRYPTION=y).  Note that older kernels did not use the
shared fs/crypto/ code, but due to the potential security implications
of this bug, it may still be worthwhile to backport this fix to them.

fscrypt: remove broken support for detecting keyring key revocationFilesystem encryption ostensibly supported revoking a keyring key that
had been used to "unlock" encrypted files, causing those files to become
"locked" again. This was, however, buggy for several reasons, the most
severe of which was that when key revocation happened to be detected for
an inode, its fscrypt\_info was immediately freed, even while other
threads could be using it for encryption or decryption concurrently.
This could be exploited to crash the kernel or worse.
This patch fixes the use-after-free by removing the code which detects
the keyring key having been revoked, invalidated, or expired. Instead,
an encrypted inode that is "unlocked" now simply remains unlocked until
it is evicted from memory. Note that this is no worse than the case for
block device-level encryption, e.g. dm-crypt, and it still remains
possible for a privileged user to evict unused pages, inodes, and
dentries by running 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches', or by
simply unmounting the filesystem. In fact, one of those actions was
already needed anyway for key revocation to work even somewhat sanely.
This change is not expected to break any applications.
In the future I'd like to implement a real API for fscrypt key
revocation that interacts sanely with ongoing filesystem operations ---
waiting for existing operations to complete and blocking new operations,
and invalidating and sanitizing key material and plaintext from the VFS
caches. But this is a hard problem, and for now this bug must be fixed.
This bug affected almost all versions of ext4, f2fs, and ubifs
encryption, and it was potentially reachable in any kernel configured
with encryption support (CONFIG\_EXT4\_ENCRYPTION=y,
CONFIG\_EXT4\_FS\_ENCRYPTION=y, CONFIG\_F2FS\_FS\_ENCRYPTION=y, or
CONFIG\_UBIFS\_FS\_ENCRYPTION=y). Note that older kernels did not use the
shared fs/crypto/ code, but due to the potential security implications
of this bug, it may still be worthwhile to backport this fix to them.
