  "CVE-2017-7374": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability existed in the filesystem component of the Linux kernel when a keyring key revocation was detected for an inode. This led to the fscrypt_info being freed immediately while other threads could be using it, creating a race condition.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
        "Race condition"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a kernel crash or other undefined behavior (potentially privilege escalation).",
      "attack_vectors": "Local malicious application.",
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to run a local application on an affected system."
    },
    "additional_details": "The provided content gives more details on the vulnerability and the fix than the CVE description. It clarifies that the bug resided in the filesystem encryption module (fscrypt) related to keyring key revocation and its interaction with ongoing filesystem operations. It also mentions that this issue affected ext4, f2fs, and ubifs filesystems with encryption support enabled. The fix involved removing the code that detects keyring key revocation to avoid the use-after-free vulnerability."
