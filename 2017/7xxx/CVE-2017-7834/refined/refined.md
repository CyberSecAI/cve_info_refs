Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7834:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2017-7834. The bug report ([Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)) is explicitly mentioned in the CVE description on the Mozilla Security Advisory page and includes the CVE alias.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause was a failure to properly enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) when a `data:` URL was opened in a new tab. Firefox, unlike other browsers, used to inherit the security context of the enclosing document for `data:` URLs. While this was technically compliant with the spec, it led to security issues when opening `data:` URLs in a new tab/window. Specifically, the CSP was not being serialized or inherited correctly during this process, allowing the `data:` URL to bypass the intended restrictions and execute scripts or access cookies.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSP Bypass:** The primary vulnerability was the bypass of the Content Security Policy. The CSP of the original page was not applied to the new tab opened by `data:` URLs, which should have inherited this policy
*   **Lack of CSP Serialization:** When a new tab is opened (e.g. via right-click -> open-in-new-tab or ctrl-click), the browser does not serialize the CSP along with the principal between the child and parent processes, which caused the CSP to be lost in the new tab context.
*   **Incorrect Principal Handling**: There was also an issue with how the principal was cloned and used when opening new tabs/windows, particularly with regard to Origin Attributes and not preserving the CSP
*   **Cookie access:** When the CSP is bypassed, arbitrary JavaScript code from the `data:` URL can be executed, allowing an attacker to potentially steal cookies or perform other malicious actions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By bypassing CSP, attackers could inject and execute malicious JavaScript code, which would lead to XSS.
*   **Cookie Theft:** Malicious scripts could steal session cookies, allowing attackers to impersonate users.
*   **Other Malicious Actions**: By executing arbitrary JS, attackers can perform various other malicious actions such as redirecting users or modifying webpage content.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Clicking a data: URL in a new tab/window:** An attacker could craft a malicious `data:` URL embedded in a link that, when opened in a new tab via right-click, ctrl-click or middle-click, would bypass the CSP of the originating webpage.
*  **Social Engineering:** An attacker could trick users into clicking malicious links in order to bypass CSP.
*   **`target="_blank"` attribute:** While not directly vulnerable, the `target="_blank"` attribute was identified as a scenario where the CSP is correctly applied, which showed that the issue was not inherent to `data:` URLs themselves.
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject a Link or Control User Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to present the user with a malicious link that utilizes a `data:` URL. This could be on a website or within a document.
* **Basic understanding of HTML and Javascript**: The attacker would need a basic understanding of these to craft a working exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that `data:` URLs inherit the correct CSP context when opened in new tabs, and later by treating data: documents as unique, opaque origins.
*   The fix involved addressing the serialization issues to maintain the CSP across processes.
*   The bug report also discusses the challenges of serializing the CSP due to its complex structure and active development. There was a discussion about possibly moving the CSP out of the principal to avoid such issues in the future, which was further compounded by cases where principal is inherited but not the CSP and vice versa.
*   The provided documents contain detailed technical discussions and code reviews among Mozilla developers, which provide more context than the official CVE description.
*   The content also highlights an initial partial fix was implemented for non-e10s browsers, followed by the complete fix for e10s via [Bug 1381761](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1381761).
