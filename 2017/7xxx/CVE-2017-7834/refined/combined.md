jfkthame: [bug 1370504](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370504 "RESOLVED INVALID - URL spoofing via IDN - MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE") is also related.
So presumably this is because we allow any single script plus Latin. This seems like the tip of the iceberg; various scripts are going to have all sorts of combining modifiers which one can match up with a Latin letter which happens to have pixels in the right place to hide it.
Can we enforce that Arabic modifiers only go on Arabic letters, and so on?

Possibly, though it's not quite that simple (the Arabic vowel marks are also used in Syriac, for example).
I'm not sure we even have to look at other scripts to find diacritic-based "spoofs"; there are small, easily-overlooked diacritics in the Combining Marks block at U+03xx that I suspect many users would miss. Consider something like <https://www.xn--google-e4d.com/> ... this has a combining dot under the second "g", but it's hardly noticeable.
And then there are delights such as <https://www.xn--mozlla-r9a478a.com/>. Do domain registrars have policies that disallow things like this? AFAICS the IDN rules would permit it...

Domain registrars should, and often do, have policies which check if a registration is homographic with another registration. But this is different - this is adding a tiny extra combining mark and hoping it doesn't get noticed. So they homographs are not exact in in that sense, and probably won't be detected by the standard algorithm. But visually, the results are still very similar.
So I think we have an issue that this is a form of spoofing which is not entirely addressed by the current algorithms. Now, my understanding is (correct me if I'm wrong) that these small dots and combining marks and so on are all allocated to one or more scripts in the Unicode Character Database. Is that right? If so, why doesn't our script mixing code detect this? Are some of these dots allocated to Latin? Or is it because we allow "Latin plus one other", and so "Latin plus a random combining mark" will always be allowed?

Generally, combining marks are considered to "inherit" the script property of the base character to which they're applied, and can in principle be used with any script. There are some -- e.g. from Arabic and Indic scripts -- that have one or more specific scripts with which they're normally associated (listed in ScriptExtensions.txt), but the general Combining Marks block (at U+03xx) is for the most part entirely script-agnostic. Something like "combining dot below" certainly has legitimate usage in Latin script, so there's no expectation that script-mixing prohibitions would be relevant.
The original report here relates to an Arabic vowel mark, which is also used in Syriac, but arguably should not be combined with Latin letters (it's not "wrong" to do so, in strictly Unicode terms, but it's sufficiently implausible that IDN rules could reasonably block it). But the more general issue of small, easily-overlooked diacritics can't be fixed that way, as many of them are truly generic -- or even primarily (though not exclusively) used with Latin script.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

Hmm.
It seems like there are a few ways we could go here.
Firstly, we could try and improve font rendering technology in some way such that such marks were more obvious when used - e.g. if they overlapped an existing bit of a letter, they didn't just disappear. This would be a Firefox (or graphite2?) fix (and a complex one).
Secondly, we could just disallow most combining marks, perhaps with a whitelist of those which were script-specific. People making domain names would need to use precomposed characters, or just not use the mark (just as e.g. English names can't have an apostrophe in LDH domain names). This has the risk of upsetting one or more language communities, particularly as ISTR that Unicode has gone backwards and forwards on whether scripts require precomposed versions of common letter+mark combos, and so some scripts may have them and others may not.
Thirdly, we could try and develop a set of rules about where combining marks were allowed. This would probably involve the Unicode Consortium, either by getting them to better classify the allowed scripts for the generic combining marks (perhaps in an advisory rather than a normative way), or even by enumerating the allowed letters for each mark. These rules could either be implemented in browsers (as they don't require knowledge of all existing domain names, as homograph algorithms do) or by registries. The risk here is ending up with a massive data table that you need to ship to solve a very niche problem.
Do we need to consult the usual suspects at the Unicode Consortium to ask them for advice at this point?

In the case of KASRA I don't see it at all in the URL bar on Mac: it seems to be below the visible area. If I click on <http://xn--google-yri.com/> I see it in the body text of the Server Not Found page (almost looks like a spec of dust on my screen), but not where it matters in the address bar. The two examples in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL spoofing using combining marks") are visible. Easy to miss for sure, but at least the differences are there for the eagle-eyed.
> Do we need to consult the usual suspects at the Unicode Consortium to ask

Probably for the best.
How does the KASRA character look on Windows? Since that's where most people are that's probably the one the determines if we call this sec-moderate or sec-high.Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---)

See <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=729979> for some mitigation the Chromium folk have implemented, although AFAICT it's not a complete solution to the general issue.

Yeah, seems to me that those mitigations are pretty specific. I'm not particularly interested in playing whack-a-mole such that what Firefox allows changes every release for the next 10 releases.

Attached patch

[Check ScriptExtensions property of combining marks when available](attachment.cgi?id=8910325&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1370497&attachment=8910325)

Here's a patch that provides some mitigation, based on the Unicode ScriptExtensions property that identifies some combining marks as being used with particular script(s) even though they have Script=INHERITED as their primary property. This blocks things like the Arabic-vowel-on-Latin-letter example here.

Check ScriptExtensions property of combining marks when available
This seems a pretty sensible and general mitigation. We may also have to switch to strict as well, but this seems orthogonal to that.

Just FTR, since [bug 1402048](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402048 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove the legacy non-IDNA2008 code path from nsIDNService, now that we always require ICU to build") has just landed, I'll remove the #ifdef IDNA2008 from this patch as this is now unconditionally the way we build.

This doesn't seem to me to really meet the ESR criteria, and I see we've marked other examples such as [bug 1399540](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox IDN display vulnerability") as wontfix there. (Feel free to disagree if you think there's an ESR case to make.)

Hi Dan, given that this is a sec-mod and too many uplifts in beta57 already, I am leaning towards wontfix'ing this for 57. I'd like to get your opinion before making a final decision here. Thanks!Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

We keep getting dinged for this so it'd be nice to fix sooner, and the patch isn't scary. But in practice real phishing sites are making enough money from non-spoofing domain names. I guess we could live without it in 57 :-(Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Check ScriptExtensions property of combining marks when available
Thanks Dan. Sorry! :( 57 is getting an unusually large # of uplift requests. I'd like to keep our risks to quality and shipping on time to a minimal. I'd prefer to let this one ride the 58 train.

An argument in favor is that we're already fixing [bug 1399939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399939 "VERIFIED FIXED - IDN script mixing policy: Consider switching to highly-restrictive") in Firefox 57 and it'd be nice to change the IDN behavior all at once.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170413192749
Steps to reproduce:
The Content-Security-Policy can be bypassed using a data: URL opened in a new tab.
Content-Security-Policy doesn't allow javascript execution code on the webpage which uses this security, but in Firefox, if a data: URL is loaded in a new tab, the javascript code contained into this data URL is executed and it can steal the cookie of the website (and others malicious actions).
example:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-eval'">
<a href=" data:text/html;html,<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>">Open Me in a new tab</a>
Actual results:
The Content-Security-Policy can be bypassed if a data URL is opened into a new tab.
Expected results:
In Mozilla Firefox, if a Webpage uses the Content-Security-Policy security, javascript code shouldn't be executed with a data: URL opened in a new tab.

Jordi, thanks for filing the bug. In Firefox, data: URIs inherit the security context of the enclosing document, which is different than in all other browser. Over the years we have accumulated multiple bug reports that data URIs can be used for XSS (see [Bug 255107](/show_bug.cgi?id=255107 "RESOLVED FIXED - Prevent data: URLs from being used for XSS")). The only reason we haven't changed that until now was, that Firefox was the only browser that implemented the data: URI behavior according to the spec. Recently the spec changed, so that data: URIs should not inherit the security context of the enclosing doucment, hence we are about to change that behavior within [Bug 1324406](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324406 "RESOLVED FIXED - Treat 'data:' documents as unique, opaque origins").
If you try your testcase (using a simple alert instead of document.cookie) you will see that all other browsers will prompt the alert, right? Within Firefox, if you simply click the link in your testcase, then Firefox will block the load with the error:
> Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at self (“script-src 'unsafe-eval'”). Source: alert('foo');.
If you right click, open-link-in-new-tab the data: URI link, then I think the problem is that we don't serialize the CSP together with the principal between child and parent, loose the CSP and hence prompt the alert.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Christoph: if we didn't inherit the origin then fine, we also don't inherit the CSP. But if we're inheriting the origin, and the CSP is embedded in the principal (maybe it isn't anymore?) then why doesn't the new document get the CSP? I thought that was one of the points of putting the CSP in the principal. What other "inherit" cases are also broken?
When does this break? The user ctrl-clicks? what if there's a target=\_blank to trigger the new page? That would be a more worrying scenario since it's only normal user interaction.Group: firefox-core-security → dom-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → DOM: SecurityFlags: sec-bounty?Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)Product: Firefox → Core

The CSP is still attached to the principal, but as explained within [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content-Security-Policy Bypass with data: URL opened in a new tab"), when performing e.g. a right-click->open-link-in-new-tab, we do a bunch of front end checks. Amongst others we check whether the page should load in the child or the parent. Currently we don't serialize the CSP between child and parent when serializing a principal and hence we loose it. I think this is what's happening, but obviously needs more investigation.
> When does this break?
I did a bunch of quick checks:
\*) regular click - CSP blocks
\*) ctrl-click - alert prompted
\*) right-click->open-link-in-new-tab - alert prompted
\*) right-click->open-link-in-new-window - alert prompted
\*) <a href="data..." target="\_blank" ...> - CSP blocks

After some debugging I finally located the exact problem [1]. As already suspected we serialize the principal but we don't serialize the CSP within the principal. I remember we already had a discussion around that a while ago and I don't think there is an easy solution to that problem. Gijs, any ideas?

If the \_blank case works, even for new windows (turn off "open new windows in a new tab instead") we should be able to make the ctrl-click and context menu cases work without too much craziness.

We can serialize the principal itself - I think the problem is that we don't serialize the CSP within the principal. In other words we loose any CSP attached to the principal during serialization/deserialization. But I just tried with e10s prefed off, and I get the same result, so the problem must be somewhere else.
But somewhere along the road we must loose the CSP, and as far as I remember that could only happen when we serialize/deserialize. The other thing that came to my mind was that we don't pass the right principal (the one with the CSP) to the docshell load, so that then within docshell we create a CSP from the referrer. But that's also not the case - within LoadURI() we already get a valid (actually the correct) triggeringPrincipal (just without the CSP attached).
Mhm, I guess this needs more debugging to find out where we actually loose the CSP - beats me.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Gijs, one problem I already identified (even though it's not the root cause of the problem here) is the fact that we are potentially generating a new codebasePrincipal using the right OA [1], but not resetting any CSP on the old principal. Looking at the stacktrace underneath, do you think we are using the wrong principal within openLinkInTab to begin with? Because this principal is the one that is passed all the way to be set on the loadinfo.

I'm not sure I understand. We should be setting the same CSP on the \*new\* principal as on the \*old\* principal, AIUI. We can't reuse the principal because that breaks opening inheriting-principal-links in containers. That we're not copying the csp is definitely a bug here, though I don't see any way to actually do this. Like, nsIPrincipal just doesn't have any scriptable APIs that allow us to set the CSP. :-\
But yeah, even if we fixed that this would still be broken in the e10s case because of the serialization. Given that we can already generate a JSON representation of the CSP, presumably this is fixable?Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(ckerschb)

Sorry, for not being precise. What I meant is that we have to set the same CSP on the new principal that was present on the old principal. Have a look at the attached patch and you know what I mean :-) One of the problems though is that csp is not scriptable. So, I think what we could do is expose a function on nsIPrincipal 'generateNewPrincipalFromOldWithNewArgs()' or something that allows us to pass in the OA we want and just return a new principal (including the CSP). Basically move useOAForPrincipal on nsIPrincipal and implement it in c++. That would work right?
The attached patch fixes the problem for all \*non\* e10s cases for the tests on [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content-Security-Policy Bypass with data: URL opened in a new tab").

The serialization of the CSP is a real problem. When first parsing the CSP we generate an object representation of the CSP (see nsCSPUtils.h). Serializing that object representation seems hard and reparsing the CSP string also seems like a non optimal solution. I have written a bunch of serialization code for principals, but serializing the CSP definitely seems like the hardest. Any suggestions on how to fix that problem?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb) → needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

What makes the problem worse is, that CSP is an active standard which is extended on a regular basis. In terms of maintenance, we would always have to update the serialization code in addition to any actual CSP changes. Keeping that in sync seems error prone on top of the actual serialization work.

How is the cspJSON code implemented? That seems like it'd be sufficient, generally speaking...

Yes, that should work, though the implementation will still return undefined results (probably just the principal you pass in) for null principals or system principals. :-)Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(ckerschb)

That could work actually, we would just need to implement the inverse part for cspToJSON - so the part that generates a CSP from the json. I'll give that a try, but it might take some time since there are also other things I am working on at the moment.Assignee: nobody → ckerschbStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(ckerschb)Priority: -- → P2Whiteboard: [domsecurity-active]

Within this patch I am only fixing the \*non\* e10s parts. If you prefer, we could file a new bug and land this patch there so that this bug only contains the e10s changes. What do you think?
Anyway, I verified this changeset fixes all the testcases described within [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content-Security-Policy Bypass with data: URL opened in a new tab") and further that the automated test browser\_oa\_private\_browsing\_window.js still works, which is the test we introduced with the initial useOAForPrincipal() function implemenetation (See [Bug 1348801](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348801 "VERIFIED FIXED - ”Open Link In New Private Window” prevents the add-on installation")).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The utilityOverlay.js changes look OK to me, but someone else should review the nsScriptSecurityManager changes.
For e10s, I don't mind much about whether we use this bug or another one, but we'll need to ship everything at the same time, I expect... (or be very circumspect about why we're making the changes in the other bug and not link it to this one) to be fair, this is a sec-moderate with significant user interaction, so I guess this might be OK.
Finally, I am still confused about how the e10s case works with target=\_blank. The thing that's creating the about:blank content viewer there must be doing so with a principal with CSP. But I'm pretty sure that the "new window" case for target=\_blank passes through the parent process (because we have to create a new browser window first), so I don't understand how we can be using an un-serialized/deserialized principal which has CSP.
In theory it should be possible to pass the principal around on the content process side only, but I don't know if that's feasible in practice - it would certainly require that we reuse the same content process for the "open link in new tab" case where we have items that inherit principals.

In the end it doesn't really matter I guess. So let's just wait till we have all the code ready within this patch and then get it landed alltogether.

The target="\_blank" uses a different codepatch then 'right-click->open-link-in-new-tab' and hence ends up with a CSP on the principal within docshell. When regular clicking a link we use the principal from nsContentUtils.cpp:5300 (see stacktrace underneath) which is then passed all the way to docshell which then blocks the load here:

In general, I think we should try and fix the CSP serialization-problem on the pricnipal, because if not in this bug, then that serialization problem will come up again in the near future.

If we do this I think we need to be careful that we don't end up propagating the CSP on the principal to places that shouldn't have the propagation. Code may be relying on the serialization to filter it out without realizing it. For example, I had a lot of trouble with this in worker code recently.
I would really love if we could move CSP off the principal as discussed in [bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client"). Probably can't do it here, of course. FWIW, though, I'm making something that can function as the "document settings object" over in [bug 1293277](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293277 "RESOLVED FIXED - service worker Client interface and APIs won't work with multiple content processes") so it might be more possible after that lands.

What cases are those? I am not entirely sure but I would think that whenever we inherit the principal we should also inherit the CSP as well, no?

Gijs, I am making on step at a time here. First I would like to generate the automated test to make sure we never regress that again. When applying the first patch from this bug, in other words when calling clonePrincipalWithUpdatedOA() and when running this test using: ./mach mochitest --disable-e10s .../browser\_data\_load\_inherit\_csp.js then it works.
When running with e10s disabled, then only the first test (the regular click) succeeds, but the other two (where we don't serialize the CSP on the principal) fail.
Ultimately I would like to remove the code duplication for checking the CSP on each subtest. I am pretty sure you can tell me how to do that, right?

How is "inherit the principal" defined in code? We pass nsIPrincipal\* around all over the place, but that does not equate to inheriting the principal. As an example, service workers are constrained to an origin, but the service worker itself should not inherit CSP from the document that registered the service worker. Magical passing of CSP around in our origin identity type makes this really error prone. Dedicated workers had the same problem for a long time as well.
Anyway, we can debate this over in [bug 1293277](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293277 "RESOLVED FIXED - service worker Client interface and APIs won't work with multiple content processes"). Please just don't break any of the worker stuff I just spent a bunch of time fixing.

This is still using a CPOW. You'll want to use a ContentTask for this, here and in the other tests (which you may or may not want to abstract into another helper function):
yield ContentTask.spawn(browser, DATA\_URI, function(uri) {
let link = content.document.getElementById("testlink");

bug\_1358009\_cloneprincipal\_with\_updated\_oa.patch
Boris, I chatted with bholley and he thinks you are the better reviewer for this stuff. Within [Bug 1348801](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348801 "VERIFIED FIXED - ”Open Link In New Private Window” prevents the add-on installation") we had to teach the principal about OriginAttributes, but we didn't propagate the CSP from the old principal on to the newly created one. The fact that we don't expose the CSP to JS caused me to expose that functionality on the scriptSecurityManager. Gijs already took a first look ([comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - Content-Security-Policy Bypass with data: URL opened in a new tab")). I verified that browser\_oa\_private\_browsing\_window.js (which we wrote for [Bug 1348801](/show_bug.cgi?id=1348801 "VERIFIED FIXED - ”Open Link In New Private Window” prevents the add-on installation")) still works.
Further I verified that with this patch the newly crafted test for this bug (docshell/test/browser/browser\_data\_load\_inherit\_csp.js) works when e10s is disabled. The reason it doesn't work with e10s yet, is because we serialize the principal when ctrl-clicking but we don't serialize the CSP on the principal.

This is kinda preexisting, but in the case when aPrincipal == aTriggeringPrincipal this will break the object identity of the two. Which is mostly a problem for nullprincipals, since those care about object identity...
It might make sense to check for the aPrincipal == aTriggeringPrincipal case and only do the clone once then.

I don't think that's the right behavior, given that nullprincipals can have OA and CSP. Yes, I know that's what the frontend code you're replacing did. It was wrong.
I think what would make the most sense is that this function returns its argument if the originAttributes already match. If not, we clone; that includes cloning for nullprincipals. That will break the security-check object identity, but that should be ok in cases when the originAttributes don't match, because things with non-matching originAttributes should not be able to reach each other anyway. I'm not sure how that should be reflected in the naming of the function; maybe ensureOriginAttributesForPrincipal?

That returns a random value. You need to set \*aPrincipal to null.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

For the needinfo, we may want move the CSP somewhere else in any case, because it's not inherited in quite the same set of cases as origin inheritance. For example, consider this testcase:
<iframe srcdoc="stuff" sandbox"></iframe>
Per spec, this inherits the CSP from the parent but does NOT inherit the principal. I'm fairly sure we get this wrong right now.
Similarly, per current spec a javascript: navigation inherits the principal but NOT the CSP. I filed <https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2589> but it's not clear how that will get resolved. Same for about:blank; filed <<https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2592>>. And blobs; filed <https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2593>
And what bkelly said about workers: they can inherit origins, but not CSP....

This particular issue was changed in [bug 1073952](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073952 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP can be bypassed with <iframe [sandbox] and [srcdoc]>"), about a month ago.
The key change is that we create a NullPrincipal for sandboxed-loads but set the CSP if we are in a srcdoc.
That being said, it doesn't mean we get CSP inheritance right in the other cases you mentioned and I agree that it should not live on the principal.
(This would also help setting a CSP on privileged chrome pages, that share the same principal.)

Boris, thanks for the notes. In fact, I agree to everything you said now that I think about it. The good news is that your comments are more or less easy to address once we figure a path forward with this bug. In fact, I think we can take that patch and fix that particular problem outside of this bug because those changes are orthogonal to the Principal/CSP inheritance problem we try to solve here.

Yes, I agree. There are quite so many cases where we should inherit the principal but not the CSP and the other way round. One of those edge cases we addressed within [Bug 1073952](/show_bug.cgi?id=1073952 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP can be bypassed with <iframe [sandbox] and [srcdoc]>"), but I am sure there are more of those. The big question is, where should the CSP live? On the nsILoadInfo? But even if we move the CSP somewhere else I guess we still might have to serialize the CSP for some cases, but we could figure those cases along the way. The big question for now, where could the CSP live if not on the principal?

Yes, this one was fixed by [bug 1381761](/show_bug.cgi?id=1381761 "RESOLVED FIXED - Treating 'data:' documents as unique, opaque origins should still inherit the CSP"). Setting this to 'invalid', but could also live with 'worksforme'.Status: ASSIGNED → RESOLVEDClosed: 7 years agoResolution: --- → INVALID

"invalid" means "invalid"--it's not a problem. If we actually \_fixed\_ this then that's a terrible resolution. "worksforme" is normally fine, but since this is a security bug it's usually worth figuring out what fixed it so we know it's not accidental or a side-effect that might go away in the future.
If we know exactly what fixed it then "fixed" is the right resolution (depends on the bug that fixed it). Especially true if there's a bounty nomination on the bug.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDResolution: INVALID → ---

Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 57

#### [#CVE-2017-7828: Use-after-free of PressShell while restyling layout](#CVE-2017-7828)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the `PressShell` object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash during these operations.

##### References

* [Bug 1406750](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1406750)
* [Bug 1412252](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412252)

#### [#CVE-2017-7830: Cross-origin URL information leak through Resource Timing API](#CVE-2017-7830)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.

##### References

* [Bug 1408990](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408990)

#### [#CVE-2017-7831: Information disclosure of exposed properties on JavaScript proxy objects](#CVE-2017-7831)

Reporter
Oriol Brufau
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where the security wrapper does not deny access to some exposed properties using the deprecated `exposedProps` mechanism on proxy objects. These properties should be explicitly unavailable to proxy objects.

* [Bug 1392026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392026)

#### [#CVE-2017-7832: Domain spoofing through use of dotless 'i' character followed by accent markers](#CVE-2017-7832)

Reporter
Jonathan Kew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

##### References

* [Bug 1408782](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408782)

#### [#CVE-2017-7833: Domain spoofing with Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters](#CVE-2017-7833)

Reporter
Rayyan Bijoora
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.

* [Bug 1370497](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497)

#### [#CVE-2017-7834: data: URLs opened in new tabs bypass CSP protections](#CVE-2017-7834)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A `data:` URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when `data:` documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1358009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1358009)

#### [#CVE-2017-7835: Mixed content blocking incorrectly applies with redirects](#CVE-2017-7835)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Mixed content blocking of insecure (HTTP) sub-resources in a secure (HTTPS) document was not correctly applied for resources that redirect from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing content that should be blocked, such as scripts, to be loaded on a page.

##### References

* [Bug 1402363](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402363)

#### [#CVE-2017-7836: Pingsender dynamically loads libcurl on Linux and OS X](#CVE-2017-7836)

Reporter
Ezra Caltum
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with Firefox's privileges.
*Note: This attack requires an attacker have local system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not affected.*

* [Bug 1401339](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401339)

#### [#CVE-2017-7837: SVG loaded as <img> can use meta tags to set cookies](#CVE-2017-7837)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

SVG loaded through `<img>` tags can use `<meta>` tags within the SVG data to set cookies for that page.

##### References

* [Bug 1325923](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325923)

#### [#CVE-2017-7838: Failure of individual decoding of labels in international domain names triggers punycode display of entire IDN](#CVE-2017-7838)

Reporter
Corey Bonnell
Impact
low
##### Description

Punycode format text will be displayed for entire qualified international domain names in some instances when a sub-domain triggers the punycode display instead of the primary domain being displayed in native script and the sub-domain only displaying as punycode. This could be used for limited spoofing attacks due to user confusion.

* [Bug 1399540](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399540)

#### [#CVE-2017-7839: Control characters before javascript: URLs defeats self-XSS prevention mechanism](#CVE-2017-7839)

Reporter
Eric Lawrence
Impact
low
##### Description

Control characters prepended before `javascript:` URLs pasted in the addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar.

##### References

* [Bug 1402896](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896)

#### [#CVE-2017-7840: Exported bookmarks do not strip script elements from user-supplied tags](#CVE-2017-7840)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file.

#### [#CVE-2017-7842: Referrer Policy is not always respected for <link> elements](#CVE-2017-7842)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a document’s Referrer Policy attribute is set to "no-referrer" sometimes two network requests are made for `<link>` elements instead of one. One of these requests includes the referrer instead of respecting the set policy to not include a referrer on requests.
