- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The characters in a secure text field were revealed during focus change events.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure handling of secure text field focus change events leading to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Characters in a secure text field, which are expected to be hidden, might be revealed. This could allow an attacker to see sensitive data entered into the text field.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is triggered when the secure text field loses focus, an event typically triggered by user interaction with the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special network access to exploit this vulnerability. Physical access or an ability to make the textfield lose focus is needed for exploitation.
