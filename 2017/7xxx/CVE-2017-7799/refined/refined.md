Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7799:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes a bug report from bugzilla.mozilla.org (Bug 1372509), which is explicitly associated with CVE-2017-7799. The advisory on www.mozilla.org also lists CVE-2017-7799, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper sanitization of data within the `about:webrtc` page. Specifically, JavaScript code within this page uses `innerHTML` to insert content without properly escaping HTML special characters. This allows for the injection of arbitrary XUL (XML User Interface Language) markup.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XUL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject XUL markup due to the use of `innerHTML` without sanitization.
*   **Self-XSS:** While the data on `about:webrtc` is primarily controlled by WebRTC usage and is not directly third-party controlled, the vulnerability still has characteristics of self-XSS and is exploitable through a malicious user interaction or specific WebRTC configurations that produce unescaped special characters in the output.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** While the primary concern is self-XSS, a successful XUL injection could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution in the worst-case scenario.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although data is not directly from third-parties, the vulnerability could possibly be used for an XSS attack if an attacker can manipulate the output.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated WebRTC Data:** An attacker would need to manipulate WebRTC data in such a way that when the data is displayed on `about:webrtc`, it includes malicious XUL injection payloads.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction or WebRTC manipulation**: The attacker would need to either convince a user to perform actions in a manner that causes the malicious payload to be generated via WebRTC or find a way to manipulate WebRTC parameters and generated data. The user has to load the page `about:webrtc` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report mentions that this issue would be "sec-critical, if there was a way for an attacker to inject markup to this page." This suggests that while the vulnerability exists, exploiting it in a realistic attack scenario might be challenging.
*   The fix involved replacing innerHTML with textContent, escaping HTML characters when using innerHTML, and use of `Object.assign` to create elements safely
*   The bug report highlights the use of `textContent` as the primary solution along with proper escaping, rather than innerHTML, when dealing with user-supplied data.
*   The fix was uplifted to Firefox 55 and 56 and was not considered for ESR52 due to low risk
