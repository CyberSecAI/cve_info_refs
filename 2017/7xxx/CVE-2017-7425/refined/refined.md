Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-7425:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue found in the Identity Manager Plug-in, which is hosted on iManager. Specifically, it's a **reflected XSS**.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page, which allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   This could lead to various impacts, such as:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Potentially performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL or request that includes malicious JavaScript code within parameters or other input fields.
*   The malicious script is then reflected back to the user's browser when the application processes the request, leading to execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs or requests with malicious JavaScript code.
*   The attacker needs to trick a victim into visiting the crafted URL, or making a request that is processed by the vulnerable server. This can be done through social engineering, phishing emails or embedding the malicious link in a third-party website or other ways to inject into the victim browser.
*  The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
