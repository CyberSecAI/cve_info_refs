Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-7703:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an invalid read within the `strutil.c` file, specifically when called by `packet-imap.c` during the dissection of IMAP packets. This issue is triggered by a malformed IMAP packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Invalid Memory Access:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read, likely due to improper handling of string lengths or parsing within the IMAP dissector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the Wireshark application. An attacker can achieve this by sending a malformed IMAP packet to a user analyzing network traffic or by convincing them to open a malicious packet trace file (pcap).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a specially crafted IMAP packet onto the network.
*   **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can provide a malicious pcap file containing the malformed IMAP packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to either inject network traffic or deliver a crafted pcap file to a user who will open it with Wireshark.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is in the IMAP dissector of Wireshark.
*   The issue was found by Otto Airamo and Antti Levom√§ki from Forcepoint.
*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11.
*   The issue is fixed in Wireshark versions 2.2.6, 2.0.12 and later.
