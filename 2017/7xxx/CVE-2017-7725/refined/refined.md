  {
    "CVE ID": "CVE-2017-7725",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the application's use of the HTTP Host header to construct URLs and its lack of proper validation of this header.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Host header injection vulnerability. The application uses the value of the Host header when generating links, but does not validate the header. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious domain into the generated links, which are then stored in the database.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "By manipulating the Host header, an attacker can cause the application to store malicious URLs within its database. When a user visits pages containing these affected URLs, they can be redirected to an attacker-controlled website.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request, where an attacker modifies the Host header to inject a malicious domain.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server with the ability to manipulate the 'Host' header. No authentication is required."
