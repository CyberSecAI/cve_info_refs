  "CVE-2017-7762": {
    "description": "When entered directly, Reader Mode did not strip the username and password section of URLs displayed in the addressbar. This can be used for spoofing the domain of the current page.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The Reader Mode feature in Firefox was not properly sanitizing URLs, specifically not stripping out the username and password components when displaying in the address bar.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Address Bar Spoofing",
         "Improper URL Sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could use this vulnerability to spoof the domain of a website in the address bar, potentially leading users to believe they are on a legitimate site when they are actually on a malicious one. This can facilitate phishing attacks where users are tricked into entering sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Directly crafted URLs to about:reader"
