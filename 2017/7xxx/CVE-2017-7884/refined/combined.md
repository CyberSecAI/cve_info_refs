Vendor
==========
<http://www.apcupsd.org>

Product
===========
APC UPS Daemon <= 3.14.14

Vulnerability Type
=====================
Privilege Escalation

Vendor Description
=====================
Apcupsd can be used for power mangement and controlling most of APC’s UPS
models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with most of APC’s
Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling models such a Back-UPS,
and BackUPS-Office. During a power failure, apcupsd will inform the users
about the power failure and that a shutdown may occur. If power is not
restored, a system shutdown will follow when the battery is exhausted, a
timeout (seconds) expires, or runtime expires based on internal APC
calculations determined by power consumption rates. Apcupsd is licensed
under the GPL version 2.

CVE Reference
===============
CVE-2017-7884

Vulnerability Details
========================
The default installation of APCUPSD allows a local unprivileged user to run
arbitrary code with elevated privileges by replacing the service executable
apcupsd.exe with a malicious executable, which will run with SYSTEM
privileges at startup.

C:\apcupsd\bin\apcupsd.exe
  RW BUILTIN\Administrators
  RW NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  RW NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users

Exploit
==========
1) Install the application with default settings.

2) Replace the service executable located at C:\apcupsd\bin\apcupsd.exe
with an executable of your choice.

3) Restart the service or computer, the executable will run.
