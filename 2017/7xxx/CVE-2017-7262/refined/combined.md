It verified that the bug was reproducible on other machines. And then it said: ```   Update 3/16/2017:    As much as I had least expected this to be the case, this appears to have been confirmed as an errata in the AMD Zen processor.  ``` And then it goes on to say: ```   Fortunately, it's one that is fixable with a microcode update and will not result in something catastrophic like a recall or the disabling of features.  ``` Basically, this is an *awesome* bug report. HN should link to it rather than the *techpowerup* article. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [sriramkarnati](user?id=sriramkarnati) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13926125)   | [parent](#13925188) | [next](#13926226) [–]  The issue seems to be fixed: <http://forum.hwbot.org/showpost.php?p=480922&postcount=30> <http://forum.hwbot.org/showpost.php?p=480524&postcount=25> [https://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2017/03/21/amd-ryzen-...](https://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2017/03/21/amd-ryzen-fma3-fix-promise/1) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gghh](user?id=gghh) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13926226)   | [parent](#13925188) | [prev](#13926125) | [next](#13927965) [–]  ah! the author of that hwbot.org post is Alex Yee; I remember his name as he wrote that insanely upvoted (and awesome) stackoverflow answer on branch misprediction: <http://stackoverflow.com/a/11227902> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [i336\_](user?id=i336_) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13927965)   | [parent](#13925188) | [prev](#13926226) | [next](#13931399) [–]  Can concur - *multiple* comments in the linked article show confusion as as to why this is even a problem "because the benchmark program in question has CPU-series-specific binaries, and it didn't release one for Ryzen yet" (paraphrasing). *Ouch.* Whoosh... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dang](user?id=dang) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13931399)   | [parent](#13925188) | [prev](#13927965) | [next](#13926306) [–]  Ok, we changed to that from [https://www.techpowerup.com/231536/amd-ryzen-machine-crashes...](https://www.techpowerup.com/231536/amd-ryzen-machine-crashes-to-a-sequence-of-fma3-instructions).

Sometimes the microcode can do simple patches like inserting a nop between problematic instruction combinations. This usually doesn't have much (if any) negative performance implications. The instruction decoder (again AFAIK) is fairly programmable. However if there is a more serious flaw in the actual silicon the microcode must rewrite the problem instructions to emulate the correct behavior and that can make it extremely slow - think emulating floating point but not quite as bad. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zeusk](user?id=zeusk) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13925076)   | [parent](#13924607) | [prev](#13925794) | [next](#13924727) [–]  or the recent C2xxx bricking 'fiasco' [http://www.guru3d.com/news-story/intel-atom-c2000-chips-are-...](http://www.guru3d.com/news-story/intel-atom-c2000-chips-are-bricking-products.html) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5sqg30/pot\_...](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5sqg30/pot_intel_shitstorm_incoming_intel_atom_c2xxx/) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jsheard](user?id=jsheard) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13925219)   | [root](#13924607) | [parent](#13925076) | [next](#13924727) [–]  Intel's chipsets aren't immune either, the first revision of P67 and H67 had a flaw that caused the SATA ports to slowly overvolt themselves to death.

I had pre-release silicon, and there was a known bug that prefetch would occasionally hang the chip. I wanted to have a little fun goofing around, so I modified crashme to replace prefetches in the randomly generated code with a noop. A few minutes later, I hung the chip. If I identified the right erratum later, it was: if there is a branch in the delay slot of a branch in a delay slot which is mispredicted, the cpu hangs. It was fixed by making this sequence throw an illegal instruction exception. (It was undefined behavior already, I think.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [i336\_](user?id=i336_) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13928178)   | [root](#13924607) | [parent](#13928041) | [next](#13924872) [–]  Interesting.

I also noted the existence of the BCM91250E via [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/broadcom-announces-n...](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/broadcom-announces-new-evaluation-platform-for-its-) sibytetm-bcm1250-mipsr-processor-to-accelerate-customers-software-and-hardware-development-75841437.html, which was kind of cool. I like how the chip is a supported target for QNX :) Now I'm wondering what you were using it for. Some kind of network device? (I think I saw networking as one of its target markets.) -- As an aside, I'm also very curious what HN notifier you use, if you use one.

Opteron wasn't out yet, Intel was pricing 64-bit Itanium very high, and this dual-core Sibyte thing was projected to have a reasonable clock and it could do 2 64-bit fp mul-adds/cycle. We had Fred Chow and the GPLed SGI Compiler on our side. And the next revision of the chip had these great 10 gig networking features that I thought I could make work well with MPI, the scientific computing message-passing standard. You can guess how it worked out: Sibyte was late, slow, and buggy. Even simple code sequences like hand-paired multiply-adds would start running at 1/2 speed after an interrupt. Our experienced compiler team was unable to get good perf on several SPECcpu benchmarks despite the code looking good. (Fred didn't have much hair left to pull out!) Soon after we raised our A round we pivoted to using Opteron for compute, building an ASIC for a specialized MPI network, and Fred's team did an Opteron backend for the compiler. The descendant of the network is now called Intel Omni-Path, and is on-package for Xeon Phi cpus. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [i336\_](user?id=i336_) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13928563)   | [root](#13924607) | [parent](#13928241) | [next](#13924872) [–]  I see. Always poignant to hear these kinds of stories. I'm curious as to whether interrupt handling was done underneath the multiprocessing layer or whether interrupts were just hammering the pipeline design. (I assume by "an interrupt" you're referring to slowdown within the fraction of a second after a given interrupt occurred, within the context of floods of interrupts interspersed between instructions?) Very cool to hear that Intel snapped up what you eventually managed to ship, FWIW - and that you were able to pivot in the way you did. Also interesting to hear about Opteron use in the field, my experience is only with tracking the consumer sector. Also, the "GPLed SGI compiler" part you mentioned caught my eye and led me to the EKOpath compiler, and particularly its OSS release in 2011: [http://web.archive.org/web/20110616135434/http://pathscale.c...](http://web.archive.org/web/20110616135434/http%3A//pathscale.com/ekopath4-open-source-announcement) After some floating back and forth I found [https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/software/general-linux...](https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/software/general-linux-open-source/880291-what-happened-to-pathscale-s-open-source-path64-compiler-suite?p=880485) which a) mirrored my questioning exactly and b) contained a very nice and straightforward answer, so I guess that put closure on that.

This complexity is present in an instruction as simple as `add`. As AVX2 instructions which accepts 3 registers and outputs 1 has a 1024bit problem space to validate. This occurred in FMA3 with a ~512bit problem space. Repeat for \_every\_ instruction (HUNDREDS). You can see how a few bugs slip though the cracks.

The control path involved with instruction decoding, register renaming, out-of-order execution, SMT, etc. is generally the cause of issues like this.

If you can actually increase your performance architecturally by doubling your vector width then you double the power dissipated by the relevant bits of your execution and memory systems, true. But doubling performance by doubling power is *really awesome*. Things like your out of order window size will tend to increase power as the square of their size. And in your typical desktop cpu regime your power scales with cube of frequency. So if you're lucky enough to have code that can benefit form 256 bit vectors then AVX will double your performance and power then the thermal management system will throttle you back down to regular power and 80% of your regular clock speed for a net of merely a 60% increase in performance. Which is really nice if you happen to be doing all 256 bit wide vector math. If you're only infrequently using vectors your vector speedup will be smaller but so will the increase in power that needs to be overcome so it's still a net win. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [magila](user?id=magila) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13925659)   | [parent](#13925039) | [prev](#13927222) | [next](#13925720) [–]  This is the main reason why, for example, the i7-7700K comes with a "base clock" of 4.2 GHz even though for most workloads the CPU will operate at 4.4 or 4.5 GHz.

The base clock affects all power states, and usually the memory and I/O (which is usually the limiting factor). On top of that is a CPU frequency multiplier that is variable and the upper limit is unlocked on certain processor and motherboard combinations. If you have an unlocked multiplier you can set the maximum multiplier for each of the Turbo states (1-core, 2-core, through all-cores). You could configure them to all be the same multiplier, or just scale up the default behavior of running at a higher clock speed when fewer cores are active. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [informedperson](user?id=informedperson) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13925720)   | [parent](#13925039) | [prev](#13925659) | [next](#13925204) [–]  You're not wrong - the Vcore boost when both AVX pipes are powered up causes increased dissipation, but a large part of that is also caused by ... well, AVX processing huge amounts of data.

So both base clock and maximum turbo clocks are lower in AVX code compared to non-AVX code. As usual, actual achieved clock speeds depend on thermal performance and are not fixed. If cooling is completely insufficient, the clock frequency will drop below base clocks, i.e. thermal throttling. To clarify: This isn't a secret, but part of the specs and even in some Intel slides. (However, platform and processor specs, even at a basic (product D/S) level, tend to be a rather lengthy read, so most do away with reading all that). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [stagger87](user?id=stagger87) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13925224)   | [parent](#13925039) | [prev](#13925204) | [next](#13925312) [–]  That is disappointing to hear.

If you execute all avx workloads, it will clock down to the avx frequency, which is below the marked tdp frequency. They are very explicit about this: "Workloads using Intel AVX instructions may reduce processor frequency as far down as the AVX base frequency to stay within TDP limits."

They have not given details, but some experts think the fix is merely an increase in the power delivered to that part of the chip. Their conclusion stems from teh fact that the FMA3 bug disappeared when the chip was over-clocked because the over-clocking required increasing the voltage to the chip. So the BIOS update probably adjust the voltages up a bit.

Assuming most of the testing budget is spent on the most common and likely instruction sequence patterns is probably not unrealistic. Still a bit odd that such a short sequence of repeats of the same instruction failed. Which got me thinking. At more than 2000 opcodes for x86-64 and legacy opcodes, testing all 3-sequences with one input is more than 8G sequences, to cover that and (guesstimated average) 64 bits of input per opcode is a staggering 10^29 number of instructions, or 2T CPU\*year at 4Gops/s. Not easy to test all that, even if it would be off by a couple of magnitudes in the right direction! Might be that valid 2-sequences is the most that can hope to be even close to exhaustively tested while at the same time covering some significant fraction of the operand space ?

It was quite famous. They eventually released a fixed stepping, and Phenom II is not affected. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [informedperson](user?id=informedperson) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13927300)   | [root](#13924403) | [parent](#13926352) | [prev](#13926397) | [next](#13924708) [–]  True, my mistake. (While it doesn't apply for this specific example, it's still the reason why one generally will see microcode-fixed errata go away rather quickly, independently of BIOS updates) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [yuhong](user?id=yuhong) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13924708)   | [root](#13924403) | [parent](#13924617) | [prev](#13924634) | [next](#13924508) [–]  Phenom II is not affected. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mhroth](user?id=mhroth) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13924508)   | [prev](#13924403) | [next](#13925771) [–]  FMA3 (fused multiply add) instructions are very common for any kind of audio processing (e.g. filters), not only for their speed but also their precision properties. Depending on how a game was compiled, these instructions would be all over the place. But if this specific sequence is every run, that's another question, of course. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gcp](user?id=gcp) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13925715)   | [parent](#13924508) | [next](#13929406) [–]  FMA is used in literally everything that deals with floats *and* has AVX2/FMA3 support, not just audio. AVX usage in game code isn't actually all *that* common, though, due to the need to support lowest common denominators. And no, this specific sequence isn't ever run. If it were, they'd have found it while designing the chip. I checked the original source and it's hand written FMA3 intrinsics that don't correspond to a real computation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Animats](user?id=Animats) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13925955)   | [root](#13924508) | [parent](#13925715) | [next](#13927056) [–]  Can you induce this through WebAssembly? Probably not, but someone should check. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sunfish](user?id=sunfish) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13927392)   | [root](#13924508) | [parent](#13925955) | [next](#13927056) [–]  WebAssembly does not currently have an fma instruction, and implementations are not permitted to fold plain multiply+add sequences into fma because that produces different rounding. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zlynx](user?id=zlynx) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13927056)   | [root](#13924508) | [parent](#13925715) | [prev](#13925955) | [next](#13929406) [–]  Some game developers that had optimized with AVX were asked to take it out since it would crash overclocked CPUs that were riding the limits. Hit a patch of AVX and bam, they'd fall over. Intel has mostly fixed this in more recent chips so that now they look ahead for upcoming AVX instructions and just slow down. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [geezerjay](user?id=geezerjay) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13929406)   | [parent](#13924508) | [prev](#13925715) | [next](#13925771) [–]  FMA (fused multiply-add) is a basic computing operation that is a basic building block in tasks such as evaluating polynomials, vector-vector and matrix-vector multiplication, convolutions, and also algorithms to solve nonlinear equations. You'd be hard pressed to find any computing application that doesn't take advantage of FMA instructions. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [filereaper](user?id=filereaper) [on March 21, 2017](item?id=13925771)   | [prev](#13924508) | [next](#13934870) [–]  Like other have mentioned, this happens, to both Intel, AMD and others. Intel had similar failures like its TSX instruction set which was only fixed in the next stepping. Not clear if AMD can push out a patch to the microcode to fix this. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ysleepy](user?id=ysleepy) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13934870)   | [prev](#13925771) | [next](#13929931) [–]  Some context relating to Intel: "We saw some really bad Intel CPU bugs in 2015, and we should expect to see more in the future" <https://danluu.com/cpu-bugs/> <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10877270> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rurban](user?id=rurban) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13929931)   | [prev](#13934870) | [next](#13927913) [–]  Can someone please at fix the title? Crashes -> Freezes. Big difference. And summarized: Intel has about 80 known similar problems as outlined in the errata, for which no known fixes exist. For this AMD bug a Bios update fix exists (more voltage). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [late2part](user?id=late2part) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13927913)   | [prev](#13929931) | [next](#13928232) [–]  Patient: Dr. It hurts when I do "this." Dr.: Don't do that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [WhitneyLand](user?id=WhitneyLand) [on March 22, 2017](item?id=13928232)   | [prev](#13927913) [–]  Is it known if he microcode patch affects performance? | | --- | --- | --- | | |
