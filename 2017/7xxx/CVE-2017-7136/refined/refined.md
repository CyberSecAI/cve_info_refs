Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7136:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from multiple memory corruption issues within the `ld64` component of Xcode. These issues occur when parsing a maliciously crafted Mach-O file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Memory corruption vulnerabilities are present. This indicates issues such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory management errors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these memory corruption vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could gain control of the affected system and perform malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves using a maliciously crafted Mach-O file as input to the `ld64` component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious Mach-O file that `ld64` will attempt to parse. This file might be introduced by tricking a user into building it or including it in a project being built by Xcode.
