| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1495541#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-09-26 09:31:46 UTC  ```  When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses.  Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path.  A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault.

# libpcre: two stack-based buffer overflow write in pcre32\_copy\_substring (pcre\_get.c)

Posted on [March 20, 2017](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2017/03/20/libpcre-two-stack-based-buffer-overflow-write-in-pcre32_copy_substring-pcre_get-c/ "11:52 am") by [ago](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/author/ago/ "View all posts by ago")

**Description**:

[libpcre](http://www.pcre.org) is a perl-compatible regular expression library.

A fuzz on libpcre1 through the pcretest utility revealed two stack overflow write. Upstream says that these bugs are fixed by one of the previous commit. However I’m providing as usual the stacktrace and the reproducer, so if you are not running the latest upstream release, like happen on debian/rhel based distros, you may want to check better the status of this bug.

The complete ASan output:

# PCRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201710-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the PCRE Library, the
worst of which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libpcre** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **8.41** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **8.41** |

### Background

The PCRE Library provides functions for Perl-compatible regular
expressions.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in The PCRE Library.
Please review the references below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition or
other unspecified impacts via a specially crafted file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PCRE users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libpcre-8.41"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
