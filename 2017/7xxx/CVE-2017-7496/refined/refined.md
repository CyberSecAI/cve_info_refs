- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The script does not verify the return code of the `mount` command after attempting to mount the boot and root partitions to `/tmp/boot` and `/tmp/root` respectively. Additionally, the script creates mount points in `/tmp` which is world-writable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of error checking after mount operations.
    - Usage of world-writable `/tmp` directory for mount points.
    - Allows symlink traversal to modify files outside of the intended mount path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can pre-create directories `/tmp/boot` and `/tmp/root` in such a way that `mount` fails. The attacker can then place symlinks within these pre-created directories to redirect file operations of the script to arbitrary locations.  Specifically, an attacker could redirect the script's attempt to modify `/tmp/root/etc/passwd` to modify the actual `/etc/passwd` file, leading to privilege escalation by setting the root password or other similar modifications.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker needs to be able to write to `/tmp`. The attacker needs to be able to create directories in `/tmp` before the script runs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user with the ability to write to /tmp and execute the affected script.
