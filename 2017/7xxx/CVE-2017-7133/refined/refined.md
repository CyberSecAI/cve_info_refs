The provided document contains details about multiple security vulnerabilities addressed in iOS 11, but it **does** include information about **CVE-2017-7133**.

Here's the extracted information regarding CVE-2017-7133:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A permissions issue existed. Specifically, MobileBackup might perform an unencrypted backup even when it was required to perform only encrypted backups.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in insufficient permission validation within the MobileBackup process.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The primary impact of this vulnerability is that a device may perform an unencrypted backup despite the requirement for encrypted backups, potentially exposing sensitive data in the backup.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the backup process itself, where the system fails to enforce the encryption requirement.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to initiate a backup of the device to exploit this vulnerability, which could be a user of the device or someone who has gained access to the backup mechanism.
