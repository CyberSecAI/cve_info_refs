Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7773:

**CVE-2017-7773: Graphite2 heap-buffer-overflow write [@ lz4::decompress] src/Decompressor.cpp:90**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow write vulnerability exists in the `lz4::decompress` function within the Graphite2 library. This occurs during the decompression of data, specifically at `src/Decompressor.cpp:90`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Heap-buffer-overflow: The code writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered during the decompression process which is used to load font data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Memory corruption**: Writing outside of allocated memory can corrupt other heap data, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Critical severity**: The bug is marked as "critical" indicating a high potential for exploitation and significant impact.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a specially crafted font file that causes the vulnerable code path in the Graphite2 library to be executed. This can be achieved through a website loading the malicious font.
    *   The specific attack vector is through the `gr2fonttest` application, which is used to test font rendering with Graphite2.
    *   The provided test case (`test_case.ttf`) demonstrates the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious font file to the vulnerable application. This could be done through a website or by convincing a user to open the malicious file locally.
    *   The attacker must have knowledge of how to craft a font file that triggers the heap buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced after the 1.3.9 Graphite release.
*   The issue was fixed upstream in commit `8afc7d0`.
*   The fix involved addressing 32-bit rollover problems within the decompressor.
*   The fix is included in Firefox versions 54 and later, as well as ESR 52.2 and later.
*   Firefox versions 52 and 53, as well as ESR 45, are marked as "wontfix" for this vulnerability.
*   The bug was found using AddressSanitizer which detects memory corruption errors.
*   This vulnerability is related to other Graphite2 vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-7778, CVE-2017-7772, CVE-2017-7774, CVE-2017-7775, CVE-2017-7776, CVE-2017-7777) that were fixed in Graphite 2 version 1.3.10, as reported in Mozilla Security Advisory 2017-15.
