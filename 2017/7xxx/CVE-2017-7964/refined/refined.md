Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-7964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of a process called `dnshijacker` on the Zyxel WRE6505 Wifi range extender. This process intercepts DNS requests and uses a lookup table stored in `/tmp/fmtable` to redirect DNS queries to attacker-controlled IP addresses. The `dnshijacker` process performs a loose match on the hostnames in DNS requests, comparing only the beginning of the hostname with entries in the lookup table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DNS Hijacking:** The `dnshijacker` process allows for arbitrary DNS redirection based on entries in `/tmp/fmtable`. This allows an attacker to redirect traffic to malicious servers by modifying the lookup table.
*   **Insecure Telnet Access:** Telnet is enabled by default and accessible with default credentials (`root`/`1234` or `admin`/`1234`), providing an easy entry point for attackers.
*   **Plaintext Passwords:** The web admin password is stored in plaintext in `/etc/pwd`.
*   **Insecure Password Storage:** The password is also stored with insecure Unix `crypt` format in `/etc/htpasswd`
*   **Outdated Software:** The device uses outdated versions of `mini_httpd` and `busybox`, which could contain additional vulnerabilities.
*   **Loose DNS Matching:** The `dnshijacker` process matches DNS requests using a weak, prefix-based comparison, allowing broad redirection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Traffic Redirection:** An attacker can redirect user traffic to malicious websites, including banking sites or other sensitive services.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker can intercept and modify user traffic.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect downloads to deliver malware.
*   **Denial of Service:** By redirecting DNS queries for update servers or other critical services, attackers can prevent the device and connected clients from receiving updates or accessing certain services.
*   **Credentials Theft:** Web interface login credentials can be obtained from the file system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Telnet Access:** Attackers can gain shell access via Telnet using default credentials and modify the `/tmp/fmtable` file to redirect DNS queries.
*   **Web Interface Vulnerabilities:** Though not explicitly demonstrated in the provided text, the plaintext password storage and use of outdated `mini_httpd` suggests that vulnerabilities such as path traversal or authentication bypass could potentially exist on the web interface to access and alter the `/tmp/fmtable` file or gain access to the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Zyxel WRE6505 device.
*   **Telnet Access:** The attacker needs to know the default username and password for telnet access.
*   **Basic Shell Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of Linux commands to modify the `/tmp/fmtable` file and restart the `dnshijacker` process.

**Additional Notes:**

The `dnshijacker` process is part of the firmware and not an intended feature that users should configure, however, it can be abused as a vulnerability. The vendor released a firmware update that disables telnet by default but did not fix the underlying vulnerability of the dnshijacker process.
