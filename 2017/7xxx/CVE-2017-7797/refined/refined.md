{
  "CVE-2017-7797": {
    "Description": "Response header name interning does not have same-origin protections and these headers are stored in a global registry. This allows stored header names to be available cross-origin.",
    "Root cause": "The header name interning mechanism in the browser did not have same-origin protections, leading to a global registry.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of same-origin policy in response header name interning",
      "Global registry for storing header names"
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows stored header names to be available cross-origin, potentially leading to information disclosure or fingerprinting.",
    "Attack vectors": "By observing how header names are normalized across different origins, an attacker can potentially track user behavior or gather information about the user's interaction with specific services or websites.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a web page and observe the behavior of the browser as it requests and receives HTTP responses."
