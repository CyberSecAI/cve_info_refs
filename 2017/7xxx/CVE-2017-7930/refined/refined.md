Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is improper authentication within the OSIsoft PI Data Archive and PI Network Manager. Specifically, PI Data Archive has protocol flaws and the older versions of PI Network Manager use a flawed authentication protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication mechanisms in both the PI Data Archive and PI Network Manager.
    *   In PI Data Archive, protocol flaws expose change records and allow server spoofing.
    *   In older versions of PI Network Manager, a flaw allows malicious users to authenticate and cause undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **PI Data Archive:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Spoof a PI server within a collective.
    *   Expose change records in the clear.
*   **PI Network Manager:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Authenticate with a server and cause undefined behavior within the PI Network Manager.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable over the network.
*   The specific attack vectors involve exploiting flaws in the communication protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the affected systems.
*   **High Skill Level:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities requires a high skill level.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory refers to two CVEs: CVE-2017-7930 and CVE-2017-7934. While the provided content focuses on CVE-2017-7930, it also mentions CVE-2017-7934 which has the same root cause but different impact and CVSS score.
*   The vulnerability in PI Data Archive has a higher CVSS v3 base score of 8.9, while the one in PI Network Manager has a score of 5.9.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to PI Data Archive 2017 to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
*   Mitigation recommendations include minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and employing secure remote access methods like VPNs.
