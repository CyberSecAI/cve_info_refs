  "description": "An out-of-bounds read in Graphite2 library.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read within the `graphite2::Silf::readGraphite` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "The out-of-bounds read can lead to a segmentation fault (crash) and potentially other undefined behavior if exploited.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted font file"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted font file to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_notes": "The issue was initially hard to reproduce due to compiler optimizations, specifically with clang. A workaround was implemented to address the underlying issue, and it was fixed in the graphite-security commit bb24c61. The issue was ultimately resolved by a patch included in bug 1349310 which was a dependency for this issue."
