  "CVE-2017-7376": {
    "description": "The vulnerability exists in the `libxml2` library due to an incorrect limit used when calculating port values within the `xmlParse3986Port` function. This could potentially allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code by providing a specially crafted XML file.",
    "affected_component": "libxml2",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect limit used during the calculation of port values in the `xmlParse3986Port` function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)"
    ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted XML file, leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, via a specially crafted XML file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted XML file to an application using the vulnerable version of libxml2.",
       "additional_details": "The fix for this issue involves correcting the limit used in the port value calculation within the `xmlParse3986Port` function. The Android patch is available at https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libxml2/+/51e0cb2e5ec18eaf6fb331bc573ff27b743898f4. Upstream fix has been implemented slightly differently, see https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2/commit/5dca9eea1bd4."
