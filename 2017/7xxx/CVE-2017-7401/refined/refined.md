{
  "CVE-2017-7401": {
    "description": "collectd contains an infinite loop due to how the parse_packet() and parse_part_sign_sha256() functions interact. If an instance of collectd is configured with \"SecurityLevel None\" and empty \"AuthFile\" options, an attacker can send crafted UDP packets that trigger the infinite loop, causing a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect interaction between the `parse_packet()` and `parse_part_sign_sha256()` functions within collectd's networking code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Infinite loop",
       "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial of service (DoS) occurs when the collectd daemon enters an infinite loop, consuming excessive CPU resources. This can lead to the daemon crashing or being killed.",
     "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely via crafted UDP packets sent to a vulnerable collectd instance.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the target system running a vulnerable collectd instance. The `collectd` instance must be configured with `SecurityLevel None` and an empty `AuthFile`."
