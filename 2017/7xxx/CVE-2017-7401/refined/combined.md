# RHSA-2017:1787 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: collectd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1787)

## Topic

An update for collectd is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 Operational Tools for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

collectd is a small C-language daemon, which reads various system metrics periodically and updates RRD files (creating them if necessary). Because the daemon does not start up each time it updates files, it has a low system footprint.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: collectd (5.7.2). (BZ#1460080)

Security Fix(es):

* collectd contains an infinite loop due to how the parse\_packet() and parse\_part\_sign\_sha256() functions interact. If an instance of collectd is configured with "SecurityLevel None" and empty "AuthFile" options, an attacker can send crafted UDP packets that trigger the infinite loop, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2017-7401)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack 11 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1439674](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1439674)
  - CVE-2017-7401 collectd: Infinite loop due to incorrect interaction of parse\_packet() and parse\_part\_sign\_sha256() functions

## CVEs

* [CVE-2017-7401](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2017-7401.html)

[![@marcinguy](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20355405?u=1d5b0a69f43272756374f6d0874b13d5a7f5a5a7&v=4&size=48)](/marcinguy)[marcinguy](https://github.com/marcinguy)opened [on Feb 13, 2017](https://github.com/collectd/collectd/issues/2174#issue-207230480)

* Version of collectd: 5.7.1 (build from source)
* Operating system / distribution:

  Linux laptop 4.4.0-62-generic [Solaris support for vmem module #83](https://github.com/collectd/collectd/pull/83)-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 18 14:10:15 UTC 2017 x86\_64 x86\_64 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

## Expected behavior

Working as usual

## Actual behavior

After sending this payload, collectd seems to be entering endless while() loop in packet\_parse consuming high CPU resources, possibly crash/gets killed after a while.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# RHSA-2017:1285 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: collectd security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1285)

## Topic

An update for collectd is now available for RHEV 4.X RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-7 and RHEV Engine version 4.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

collectd is a small C-language daemon, which reads various system metrics periodically and updates RRD files (creating them if necessary). Because the daemon does not start up each time it updates files, it has a low system footprint.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: collectd (5.7.1). (BZ#1446472)

Security Fix(es):

* collectd contains an infinite loop due to how the parse\_packet() and parse\_part\_sign\_sha256() functions interact. If an instance of collectd is configured with "SecurityLevel None" and with empty "AuthFile" options an attacker can send crafted UDP packets that trigger the infinite loop, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2017-7401)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Virtualization 4.1 x86\_64
* Red Hat Virtualization 4 for RHEL 7 x86\_64
* Red Hat Virtualization for IBM Power LE 4 for RHEL 7 ppc64le

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1439674](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1439674)
  - CVE-2017-7401 collectd: Infinite loop due to incorrect interaction of parse\_packet() and parse\_part\_sign\_sha256() functions
* [BZ - 1446472](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1446472)
  - Upgrade collectd to 5.7.1

## CVEs

* [CVE-2017-7401](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2017-7401.html)

## References

## Topic

An update for collectd is now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

collectd is a host-based system statistics collection daemon that gathers metrics from various sources periodically, such as the operating system, applications, log files and devices, and storage clusters. As the daemon does not start up each time it updates files, it has a low system footprint.

For Red Hat Gluster Storage Web Administration 3.4, collectd service is responsible for gathering metrics from Red Hat Gluster Storage clusters.

The updated collectd package includes the following security bug fixes.

Security Fix(es):

* collectd: Infinite loop due to incorrect interaction of parse\_packet() and parse\_part\_sign\_sha256() functions (CVE-2017-7401)
* collectd: double free in csnmp\_read\_table function in snmp.c (CVE-2017-16820)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2017-11-22 16:07:48 UTC  ``` The csnmp_read_table function in snmp.c in the SNMP plugin in collectd before 5.6.3 is susceptible to a double free in a certain error case, which could lead to a crash (or potentially have other impact).  Upstream bug:  <https://github.com/collectd/collectd/issues/2291>  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/collectd/collectd/commit/d16c24542b2f96a194d43a73c2e5778822b9cb47>  References:  <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=881757>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2017-11-22 16:08:51 UTC  ``` Created collectd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1516449](show_bug.cgi?id=1516449 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-16820 collectd: double free in csnmp_read_table function in snmp.c [epel-6]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1516450](show_bug.cgi?id=1516450 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-16820 collectd: double free in csnmp_read_table function in snmp.c [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1516451](show_bug.cgi?id=1516451 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-16820 collectd: double free in csnmp_read_table function in snmp.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c2)  Joshua Padman    2017-11-23 05:59:38 UTC  ``` Versions 5.7.x are vulnerable too.  Conditions exist in OSP11/12 package collectd-5.7.2-1.1.el7ost. Still completing analysis.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c3)  Joshua Padman    2017-11-24 05:59:18 UTC  ``` Still determining severity for OSP. collectd was tech preview in 7-9 so marking won't fix for those.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c4)  Joshua Padman    2017-11-26 22:10:26 UTC  ``` collectd is in tech preview in OSP10 as well, marked accordingly.  Fixing in OSP11-12 partly because the security risk but also as a reasonable use case also has potential to crash the application.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-01-30 21:08:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0 Operational Tools for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2018:0252 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0252](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0252)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-02-13 16:12:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 Operational Tools for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2018:0299 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0299](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0299)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-03-20 16:35:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for RHEL-7   Red Hat Virtualization Engine 4.1  Via RHSA-2018:0560 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0560](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0560)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-05-17 15:26:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 Operational Tools for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2018:1605 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1605](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1605)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1516447#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-04 06:39:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2018:2615 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2615](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2615)   ``` |  |
