```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The web application on the Humax Digital HG100R device does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically in the 404 error page.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 404 error page. When a user visits the crafted URL, this code will be executed in their browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as session hijacking, stealing cookies, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is a crafted URL that contains malicious JavaScript code, which is then reflected back to the user when they access a non-existent page on the device.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload and induce a user to visit the crafted URL.
