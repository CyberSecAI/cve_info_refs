Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox for Android handles the address bar when a new tab is loaded via JavaScript events while in fullscreen mode. Specifically, if a new tab is opened using `alert()` and the browser is in fullscreen, the address bar disappears. This allows a malicious site to spoof the address bar.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The core vulnerability is the ability to hide the browser's address bar.
*   **Missing UI Element:** The location bar (address bar) is not rendered when a specific sequence of actions are taken.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Deceptive Display:** A malicious site can create a fake address bar, displaying an arbitrary URL, deceiving users about the site's true origin.
*   **Phishing and Malware:** Users might be tricked into believing they are on a legitimate site, making them vulnerable to phishing attacks or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage.
2.  **Fullscreen Trigger:** The victim visits the webpage and is forced into fullscreen mode through JavaScript.
3.  **New Tab with Alert:** The page opens a new tab using JavaScript, loading a page that calls `alert()`. This causes the location bar to disappear.
4.  **Spoofed Address Bar:** The attacker's page now displays a spoofed address bar, potentially directing the user to a phishing site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server/Hosting:** The attacker needs a web server to host a malicious webpage.
*   **JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of JavaScript to manipulate the browser window.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit the malicious webpage on Firefox for Android.
*   **Android Firefox:** This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop Firefox is not affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to Bug 1319366, which involved the navigation bar turning black in specific circumstances. The fix for 1319366 also resolves this issue.
*   The bug report mentions a test case available at `https://www.alternativ-testing.fr/Research/Mozilla/android/-K8H4D0-Location_Bar_Spoofing-FullScreen-and-alert-JavaScript-Function/TESTCASE2.html`
*   The security impact is classified as "moderate".
*   The issue was fixed in Firefox 54.
