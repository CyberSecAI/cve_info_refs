Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-7413

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize command parameters passed to the system's `gpg` binary within the Horde_Crypt library. Specifically, when encrypting emails, an attacker can inject malicious commands via crafted email addresses which are then passed directly to the `gpg` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application directly incorporates user-provided input (specifically the recipient email address) into a command executed by the operating system, without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the webserver. This means an attacker could potentially gain full control of the server, read sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an authenticated user of Horde Webmail attempting to encrypt an email to a maliciously crafted recipient email address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Horde Webmail.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious email address containing injected command parameters.
- The attacker must trigger an email encryption to that address.
