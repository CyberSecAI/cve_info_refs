Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7284:

**Vulnerability:** Forced Password Change

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the user password change functionality within the `/api/includes/users.php` file. Specifically, a PUT request with the ‘force’ parameter set to true bypasses normal authentication and access controls, allowing an attacker to change a user's password without knowing the current password.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Bypassed Authentication:** The 'force' parameter allows bypassing the usual authentication check, which would normally verify the current password.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the 'force' parameter which allows the attacker to inject this parameter and set it to true.
*   **Direct Access Control Failure:** The application does not have the proper checks to ensure that only users authorized to change a password can make the changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Account Access:** An attacker can change the password of any user account, including administrator accounts, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Data Breach:** With compromised administrator accounts, attackers can access sensitive data managed by the Unitrends application.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could lockout legitimate users by changing their passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP PUT Request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP PUT request to `/api/users/$UID/` targeting a specific user. This request includes the user's ID and a payload with the new password and the `force=true` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the Unitrends web application.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoint `/api/users/$UID/`.
*  **Knowledge of User ID:** The attacker must know the target user id.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must have the ability to craft a PUT request with the force parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Unitrends versions prior to 9.1.2.
