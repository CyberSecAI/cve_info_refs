Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7677:

**CVE-2017-7677: Apache Ranger Hive Authorizer should check for RWX permission when external location is specified**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Apache Ranger Hive Authorizer does not properly check for Read, Write, and Execute (RWX) permissions when an external location is specified for Hive tables.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Insufficient permission checks in the Hive Authorizer when dealing with external locations. This allows for table creation without proper authorization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially create Hive tables with external locations without having the necessary RWX permissions. This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data in those external locations.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the creation of Hive tables using an external location without proper permission checks being enforced.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to create Hive tables and specify an external location. They must also have some level of interaction with the Hive environment and the Ranger policy enforcement mechanism.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability arises from a flaw in Apache Ranger's Hive Authorizer where RWX permission checks are not enforced when an external location is specified during table creation. This could enable malicious actors to create tables without the required privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation.
