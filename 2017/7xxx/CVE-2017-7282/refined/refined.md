The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Unitrends software.  The section titled "LFI IN UNITRENDS < 9.1.1 (CVE-2017-7282)" directly relates to the specified CVE.

**CVE-2017-7282 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `downloadFile` function in `restore.php` does not sanitize the filename provided in a POST request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application directly opens and reads the file specified by the `$filename` variable without any validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can read any file on the server accessible to the web server's user, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/api/restore/download` endpoint with the filename parameter set to a file path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement to exploit this specific vulnerability, but this might depend on the application's overall access control setup.
