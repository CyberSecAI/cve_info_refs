{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `flac_buffer_copy` function within the `flac.c` file of libsndfile. Specifically, it involves an invalid memory access during the copying of buffered FLAC data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Invalid memory READ",
      "Invalid memory WRITE"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted FLAC file. This could lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process handling the file.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted FLAC file. An attacker would need to provide the malicious FLAC file to the target user, who would then need to open this file using an application that uses the vulnerable version of libsndfile.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted FLAC file to the victim and induce them to process it using the vulnerable libsndfile library."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "versions < 1.0.28"
    ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "version >= 1.0.28"
  ],
 "details": "The provided information details two distinct issues: an invalid memory read and an invalid memory write, both occurring in the `flac_buffer_copy` function. The vulnerability can be triggered using a crafted FLAC file, leading to a segmentation fault (SEGV) and program termination, as shown by the AddressSanitizer output. The issues are located specifically on lines 263 and 264 of `flac.c`. The fix for this issue is commit 60b234301adf258786d8b90be5c1d437fc8799e0"
