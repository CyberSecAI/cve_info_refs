Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-7358:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `guest-account` script used by LightDM, Ubuntu's default display manager, when creating temporary home directories for guest users.
- The script uses `mktemp` to generate a temporary directory name (e.g., `/tmp/guest-XXXXXX`). It then converts this name to lowercase and uses it to create the guest user's home directory, potentially using `mv` to rename the original directory to its lowercase version.
- The core problem is a race condition: an attacker can monitor `/tmp` for the creation of the temporary directory and, before the `mv` command is executed, create a directory with the lowercase name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Time-of-check to Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:**  The vulnerability stems from the time gap between the script checking for the directory's existence and the actual creation/rename operation, allowing for a race condition.
- **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The script's reliance on `mktemp` and subsequent renaming to a lowercase version introduces an exploitable race condition.
- **Lack of proper validation/sanitization**: The script doesn't check if a directory already exists at the location after converting the temporary name to lowercase.
- **Privileged Script:** The `guest-account` script runs with root privileges, making it a potent attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit the race condition to gain control over the guest user's home directory.
- **Arbitrary Directory Takeover:** By controlling the guest user's home directory, an attacker can manipulate its contents, including using symbolic links to point the home directory to critical locations like `/usr/local/sbin`, `/bin`, or any other directory in the file system.
- **Root Code Execution:** By placing malicious executables in a location controlled by the attacker and then triggering the `getent` command, which runs as root, the attacker could achieve root code execution. This allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to root.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Monitoring /tmp:** The attacker needs to monitor the `/tmp` directory for the creation of the guest user's temporary directory using tools like `inotify`.
- **Race Condition Exploitation:** The attacker needs to win the race condition against the `mv` command.
- **Guest Account Trigger:** The attacker triggers the guest account creation by using `dm-tool lock` and `dm-tool switch-to-guest`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Must have local access to the system.
- Must be able to execute code on the system
- Requires the ability to monitor filesystem events (e.g., using `inotify`) and create files/directories quickly.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit involves creating a symbolic link to `/usr/local/sbin` when the directory name is in lowercase. The attacker can then create a malicious `getent` command to be executed by root during the guest user's session logout process.
- The vulnerability exists because the `guest-account` script uses a temporary directory that is not created atomically, allowing an attacker to interfere with the process.
- The fix involves detecting the presence of a maliciously created guest directory and exiting before proceeding with guest account creation, thus preventing the takeover.
- A denial-of-service (DoS) condition remains possible as the check and creation of the directory are not atomic.

This vulnerability affects Ubuntu versions 16.04 LTS (Xenial), 16.10 (Yakkety), and 17.04 (Zesty), with fixes released in `lightdm` versions `1.18.3-0ubuntu1.1`, `1.19.5-0ubuntu1.1`, and `1.22.0-0ubuntu2`, respectively.
