{
  "CVE-2017-7608": {
    "description": "The ebl_object_note_type_name function in eblobjnotetypename.c in elfutils 0.168 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted ELF file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because the ebl_object_note_type_name function does not properly handle notes with zero-sized names in ELF files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer over-read",
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "A crafted ELF file can cause a heap-based buffer over-read, leading to an application crash and denial of service.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a crafted ELF file. The file can be delivered over the network (as indicated in the NVD CVSS vector) or via local file access (as indicated by SUSE)." ,
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ELF file to the elfutils application. The required capability or position would be 'remote' according to NVD, or 'local' according to SUSE, where local means a user that can execute a binary on the target system."
    },
    "affected_versions": "elfutils 0.168",
    "fixed_versions": "elfutils 0.169 and later",
    "patch_details": "The patch adds an explicit check for namesz == 0 before using the name data in the note and treats zero-sized note names as an empty string."
