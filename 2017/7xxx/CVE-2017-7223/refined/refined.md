Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `do_scrub_chars` function of the GNU Assembler (gas) within Binutils. This function attempts to unget an End-Of-File (EOF) character, which leads to writing out of bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Global buffer overflow. Specifically, a single byte is written beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The identified impact is a global buffer overflow. Although the provided information notes that a segfault did not occur on the reporting system, the ASAN (AddressSanitizer) tool clearly indicates the overflow. While this specific case did not crash the program, such overflows could lead to denial of service (as indicated in the Gentoo Security Advisory) and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted input to the assembler (`as`). In this specific instance, providing a single forward slash "/" was enough to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted file to the assembler, which could occur locally or remotely depending on the usage scenario of the assembler. In most cases, the attacker will need local access. The Gentoo security advisory, however, notes that a "remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially crafted ELF, tekhex, PE, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition," indicating the possibility for remote exploitation via malicious files.

**Additional details:**
- The `saved_input_len` variable, which is located in memory immediately before the `input_buffer`, is overflowed when `do_scrub_chars` attempts to write a value beyond its boundary.
- The fix involves not attempting to unget an EOF character.
