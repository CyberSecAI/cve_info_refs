  "response": {
    "match": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to ProFTPD not checking all path components of the DefaultRoot for symlinks when `AllowChrootSymlinks` is disabled. It only checks the last path component, allowing attackers to bypass this control by using symlinks in other parts of the path.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incomplete path validation for symlinks",
      "Bypassing AllowChrootSymlinks restriction"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with local access, such as a user on a shared hosting environment, could bypass the intended chroot restrictions by manipulating the path to the user's home directory. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to areas of the filesystem that would normally be restricted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the server filesystem",
      "Manipulation of user's home directory"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires local access and the ability to manipulate directory structure and symlinks within the user's home directory. This would typically be a user with shell access to the server.",
        "additional_details": "The fix involves walking the entire DefaultRoot path, recursively checking all components for symlinks."
