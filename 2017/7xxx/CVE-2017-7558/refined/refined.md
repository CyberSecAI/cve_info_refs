Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-7558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in an out-of-bounds read within the Linux kernel's SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation. Specifically, the functions `inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill()` and `sctp_get_sctp_info()` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The affected functions read beyond the allocated memory boundary when filling sockaddr data structures. These structures are used to export socket's diagnostic information via netlink.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** Exploitation leads to a kernel data leak where up to 100 bytes of uninitialized slab memory can be disclosed to a user-space process.
*   The leak can happen if a user makes a `INET_DIAG_LOCALS` or `INET_DIAG_PEERS` netlink request for a SCTP socket, such as through the `ss` tool.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The vulnerability is triggered by local users sending specifically crafted netlink requests for SCTP socket diagnostic information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **Netlink Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the kernel's netlink interface to make a specific diagnostic request on a SCTP socket.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions from v4.7-rc1 up to and including v4.13.
*   The issue was discovered by Stefano Brivio of Red Hat.
*   A patch has been developed and is available.
*   Red Hat has issued security advisories (RHSA-2017:2918, RHSA-2017:2930, RHSA-2017:2931, RHSA-2017:3200) to address this vulnerability in affected products.
*   Debian also released a security advisory (DSA-3981-1) addressing the issue for stretch systems.
*   The `ss` tool from the `iproute2` package can trigger the vulnerability with `ss -Si` or `ss -Sm`.
