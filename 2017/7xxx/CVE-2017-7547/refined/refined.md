  "CVE-2017-7547": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An authorization flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled access to the pg_user_mappings view on foreign servers.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "User mappings could leak data to unprivileged users. The pg_user_mappings view disclosed passwords to users lacking server privileges.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, authenticated attacker could retrieve passwords from user mappings defined by the foreign server owners without actually having the privileges to do so, potentially using it to connect via another mechanism.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, authenticated access.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user and requires no privileges on a large object."
