MailNews Core :: MIME
Problems with parsing the MIME structure and displaying messages. When this problem happens, it's often useful to attach a copy of the mail message generating the problem. If you have Communicator 4.x, you can select the message and save it as an .eml file (just save with the .eml extension). A few examples: 1. The contents of a message do not display properly. Certain items do not show up.

Part of [bug 1423430](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423430 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Mailsploit (tracking)")
<https://www.mailsploit.com>
Reproduction:
1. Send yourself an email with SMTP:
$ netcat ###YOUR.SMTP.SERVER### 25
MAIL FROM:<=?utf-8?b?cG90dXNAd2hpdGVob3VzZS5nb3Y=?==?utf-8?Q?=00?==?utf-8?b?cG90dXNAd2hpdGVob3VzZS5nb3Y=?=@mailsploit.com>
RCPT TO: <###your.email.address@your.own.provider.not.gmail.and.co###>
DATA
From: =?utf-8?b?cG90dXNAd2hpdGVob3VzZS5nb3Y=?==?utf-8?Q?=00?==?utf-8?b?cG90dXNAd2hpdGVob3VzZS5nb3Y=?=@mailsploit.com
To: moron@example.com
Date: Wed, 6 December 2017 22:00:00 +0200
Subject: mailsploit
Yeah, right.
.
QUIT
2. Open the email in Thunderbird
Actual result:
\* The From field displays:
"potus@whitehouse.gov
\* If you click on the email address, you still see the same email address in the context menu.
Expected result:
\* The From field displays:
-potus-whitehouse.gov@mailsploit.com
or even better:
invalid@mailsploit.com
Analysis:
I think the bug here is that we cut the string off at an embedded null \0 character.
That might be in libmime or in JSMime. We need to find the place, and before that happens, we should strip the null character.

When you import the message, it is displayed as
"potus@whitehouse.gov[null]potus@whitehouse.gov"@mailsploit.com
That indicates that JS Mime is displaying it correctly. However, with the next repaint event, this is shortened to "potus@whitehouse.gov.
The task it to find where this repaint happens and why the address is truncated then.

Replying to the e-mail in question gives this in the composition:
On 02/12/2017 19:16, "potus@whitehouse.govpotus@whitehouse.gov"@mailsploit.com wrote:
However, the text can't be copied in full since it seems to contain an invisible x\00. BTW, the reply address is
potus@whitehouse.gov <>
and sending with this will fail, so there is a reduced chance that anyone will disclose information to the attacker.
Given that the null-byte is mis-handled on at least two locations, during the repaint and during the copy/paste, I've come to the conclusion that JS Mime should not hand on the null-byte but should replace it with [x\00].

@Jörg, as I said, we should simply strip the null byte. Not replace it.

If we replace it, I would consider it an active attack, and I'd replace the \*entire\* local part with "[invalid]". No legitimate email address contains null bytes, so we should proactively protect the user.

Looks good to me.
For readability, could you please put the .replace() in its own line above the return, like so:
+ decoded = decoded.replace(/\x00/g, ''); // strip null chars
return [decoded, ''];
and
+ var decoded = atob(sanitize);
+ decoded = decoded.replace(/\x00/g, ''); // strip null chars
- return [decoded, buffer];

jsmime.patch (v2)
Actually: No. This is readable. We don't need extra variables, not to mention that 'let' should be used instead of 'var'.
Explaining what code does is bad style, if anything, one could add a comment as to the why. But that would be:
Strip null characters because hell will break loose if we let them through.
Also not useful.

I've talked with Joshua on IRC. JS Mime can also decode attachment data, like binary image data, although it's not used in TB so far.
So removing nulls should only be done when decoding RFC2047 tokens. This patch does that.
However, Joshua said on IRC:
01:42:36 - jcranmer: my gut would say to kill it from the access methods in mimeJSComponents.js
So this patch might be the wrong approach altogether.

jsmime.patch (v3)
Looks good to me.
I'd still appreciate the "// strip null chars" comment, because I don't consider hex escape sequences to be readable, but alas...
Just a small request:
> removeNulls = false
sanitize = true
a) rename param: We might need to strip other chars later
b) the default should be safe. If callers want the raw binary data, they should explicitly say so. I think the majority of callers need the sanitized version.
Aside from that, looks good.
A third set of eyes can't hurt, so it would be nice to get jcranmer's review, too, if he's around anyways.

the flag is ugly, that's true. but...
> my gut would say to kill it from the access methods in mimeJSComponents.js
my gut says to strip it as low level as possible. Less can go wrong, if you add another function that uses the decoder and the developer doesn't know about it.

(One of the base rules of secure programming is to sanitize data as early as possible, as soon as it comes in. \*Not\* higher up / later on / when it's used.)

jsmime.patch (v3)
Please land this.
As explained above, this is better than the higher level fix, because there might be other functions using the decoder, now or in the future.
Secure coding rules demand to sanitize as soon as the data comes in, not later or higher up.

+ // [Bug 1423432](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423432 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mailsploit part 1: From addresses with encoded null character are cut off"): Encoded strings with null bytes,
+ // in base64 a single null byte can be encoded as AA== to AP==.
+ ["\"null=?UTF-8?Q?=00?=byte\" <nullbyte@example.com>",
+ [{name: "nullbyte", email: "nullbyte@example.com"}]],
+ ["\"null=?UTF-8?B?AA==?=byte\" <nullbyte@example.com>",
+ [{name: "nullbyte", email: "nullbyte@example.com"}]],
But that now doesn't pass any more :-(

Given that v3 works, has a test, is QA tested, and fixes the bug fine, and is IMHO also the right approach, and time is important here, I landed this.

This patch is pretty clearly the better way to go. But is there any reason all unprintable ascii is not being removed as well (aside from \n\r\t which need to go to the next level). Similar to the feed sanitization bug. Meaning regex like:
.replace(/[\x00-\x08\x0B-\x0C\x0E-\x1F\x7F]+/g, '')

I concur. That's what [bug 1423439](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423439 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Mailsploit: Strip highly unusual characters from the email address") is about. This bug here is about a quick obvious hotfix about the null char, while [bug 1423439](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423439 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Mailsploit: Strip highly unusual characters from the email address") addresses the broader issue.
Regarding patch v3 vs. nulls patch: Please consider that there might be other places that use the JSMime decoders and that expect strings, not binary data. These should be fixed as well, not just email headers. Then again, this is just a hotfix, so any reasonable patch that fixes the issue is fine for now.

Well, despite that and 2 people including the reviewer asking to include all non ascii as well, why didn't that land?
For the record, all these other mailsploit bugs are completely WONTFIX. Evicting longtime spec compliant chars due to spoofing concerns is ill-considered and kneejerk and should not be entertained further. There is a clear prior art solution in what Fx and others do in the urlbar for homograph spoofs. The solution is to highlight the valid email, @, and domain while reducing the importance of any localpart string and middle cropping it, with a tooltip for the whole string, and ensuring the valid parts are always visible and visually enhanced.

There are many reasons:
We, or let's say \*I\*, had little time. As you can see, a patch was landed here pre-maturely and backed out. So I wanted to fix the damage asap.
We're talking about the non-printable characters 0x00 to 0x1F. I'd have to see how an e-mail with these characters behaves. Having had a quick look now, they show as illegal characters, so little square boxes with two rows of numbers in them. Is that so bad? I'd rather show that the header has garbage than sanitising it so it looks valid when it isn't.
Also, I trusted [comment #30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423432#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mailsploit part 1: From addresses with encoded null character are cut off") saying that [bug 1423439](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423439 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Mailsploit: Strip highly unusual characters from the email address") is about this. But it's not. That bug wants so remove much more (that IMHO will cause a stream of user complaints).
So if anyone wants to file a bug and argue in favour of removal of those characters, they can go ahead. It's pretty simple to write a patch including a test. The feed sanitization ([bug 1411699](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411699 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-011: RSS Feed vulnerable against Email Injection")) on the other hand was done to fix a security issue.

Because this bug is about the null character only, and a direct fix for the concrete problem we know. The point was to fix this particular known bug, and fix it quickly.
We should then take a little time to discuss what further additional protections we will add. But that doesn't need to be done in the middle of the night.
I would like to ask everybody to try to avoid accusations of any sort, including "Why did you [not] do ABC?". Let's help each other.

Mailsploit test (<https://www.mailsploit.com/>) renders exactly the same in v52.5.2 as in v52.5.0 on Windows 7 x64.
Most importantly, the 'From' column of the mailboxes till shows the forged (cut-off prefix) email address.
In the preview pane of by opening the email content, no display change is to be noticed.
Seeing no difference at all since v52.5.2, I hardly consider thix bug as 'fixed'.
Moreover, the 'Low' criticality label is debatable.Flags: needinfo?(jorgk)

I didn't classify this as "low", but that's apparently the rating if it's spoofing since From addresses are generally not reliable.
The fix works, but not for messages which are already received; for those, the header is served from the database (.msf) file. So repair the folder or drag the message out to the desktop and then re-import it.Flags: needinfo?(jorgk)

It was implied but apparently not understood nor even considered that a new test was issued on the Mailsploit website after having updated Thunderbird to v52.5.2, thus I clarify that here and now...
The render of the new test is equally rendered in every aspect to the old test done on v52.5.0.

I don't understand what you're saying.

I've just tried 52.5.2 again, when importing a sample e-mail, I see the full sender address, no truncation takes place.

If you look at the screenshot I uploaded, you will notice the headers in the mail preview could be considered 'OK' as the 'mailsploit.com' suffix appears.
However, in the mail list on top, you can clearly see the truncated, spoofed, email address is shown. IMHO, the mail list 'From' address is of greater importance, since it represents the entry point for people looking at their email messages.
The Google spreadsheet you share merely quote this bug report, especially its claim of having the problem solved. Could you specify how this document helps addressing the current issue?
At best, I think it would be most appropriate to consider the resolution of the issue WIP or partially solved, not resolved.

The situation is this:
For newly received or imported messages, both the thread pane (message list) and the header pane show the full address.
For messages received with TB 52.5.0 or earlier, TB 52.5.2 will only show the full address in the header pane but not in the thread pane. The display in the thread pane comes from the message database, the .msf file, as mentioned in [comment #45](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423432#c45 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mailsploit part 1: From addresses with encoded null character are cut off").
I was wrong in saying that repairing the folder (via Properties, Repair Folder) will fix the truncated display. To fix the truncated display in the thread pane a) delete the folder's .msf file or b) save/drag the message to the desktop or a folder and then re-import it.
Sadly we can't regenerate all databases containing truncated headers.

Seriously? I do not know how to phrase that better... That will be my last attempt, though, I won't fight one who won't listen.
Read the following slowly:
What my screenshot shows highlighted is a newly received message (2017-12-28T07:43:\*\*+01:00) on Thunderbird v52.5.2.
The message \*underneath\* (not selected) is a remnant from the \*previous\* test in early December, done on Thunderbird v52.5.0.
\*Both\* messages show a corrected, non-truncated, email address in the headers parts of the opened message ("potus@whitehouse.gov"@mailsploit.com). Even the message received at the time on v52.5.0 shows the corrected output.
\*Both\* messages show exactly the same, so I do not know anything about your database stuff, but it does not seem to relate to the problem I am mentioning here.
What I see which is \*wrong\* is the truncated, spoofed, email address in the 'From' column from the messages list.
Sum-up of the problem at hand here:
A message received from the mailsploit.com website test tool on \*v52.5.2\* still improperly shows the spoofed email address in the preview of the email headers in the email messages list.
Please have a slow, thorough look at the screenshot I uploaded once again.

Thanks for your persistence. I filed [bug 1427382](/show_bug.cgi?id=1427382 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mailsploit side-issue: TB feature to only show the display name in the thread pane can be used for spoofing") to address the remaining issues.
Your comments preceding [comment #51](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423432#c51 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mailsploit part 1: From addresses with encoded null character are cut off") weren't as clear. You could have summarised your concern in two lines:
Go to <https://www.mailsploit.com/> and "Try The Demo"
Send all 14 "payloads", TB will only handle five of them. In nine of them, the From address is still truncated somewhere.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

|  | |

Thunderbird supports import and rendering of RSS feeds. After a user imports a new RSS feed, it parses the entries and displays them. Specifically, Thunderbird parses the defined RSS items and converts them into an email structure to be able to properly display them. However, it was discovered that at least two RSS fields can inject new lines into the created email structure, therefore having a capacity to modify the whole body.
The media:content specifies resources, which should be appended as external attachments. The content of this element is placed after an X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header in the created email structure but newlines are not filtered.
<media:content url="&#x0a;injected"></media:content>
The content of the guid element is parsed and appended to the Message-ID header at the beginning of the email structure. To underscore, the newlines are not filtered and therefore the email structure can be tampered with.
<guid isPermaLink="false">myguid&#x0a;</guid>
The following PoC abuses the guid element to inject a completely new email structure.

It is recommended to remove all newlines specified in RSS fields. This should be done after entities are decoded to ensure that no newline can slip through. This ensures that an RSS feed cannot completely modify the created email structure.

Remove all 00-1F chars from the document. Long ago the xhr request was changed to xml so gecko wouldn't even pass a doc with decimal bits to the parser. But escaped bits.. Subscribe from local file:// for testing requires the command |FeedUtils.\_validSchemes.push("file")| in console.

Won't this be trouble for newlines if you have, say <pre> elements in the inline feed content?

I don't think so, it would make them look minified within the <pre> tag but losing the \n shouldn't make a syntax difference. But I could be wrong; do you have an example?
The alternative is to be selective about it and consider each header, and avoid the content. But this could get fragile given all the assumptions with underspecified rss2.0.

If the feed item content contains
<pre>
row1
row2
row3
</pre>
... you don't want to display row1row2row3. But
row1
row2
row3
What do you mean by minified?

I was thinking of inline css (minified is not the right word). Back to the hard way.

parser.patch - initial approach, not for checkin
In retrospect, I don't like this approach. If the entire document can't be scrubbed, then all tags should be unless they are the tags that can't be.

Cure53 called this item "high" severity, but what are the implications of creating a new email structure? Would it be able to escape the feed folder? How is this much different from just adding another item to the feed, which the feed author pulling this trick could do anyway? If it spoofs a mail, how is that much different than sending spam with a forged address? Does such a mail entry get created bypassing some important sanity checks we do on the content of mail, or do we do those on display of the mail also?

I think this approach is still good enough. I kind of liked it.

This depends on [bug 1411716](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411716 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-014: JavaScript Execution via RSS in mailbox:// origin"), which can't be applied.
Note that the regexp landed here needs to be corrected by uplifting [bug 1418666](/show_bug.cgi?id=1418666 "RESOLVED FIXED - Not rendering comma in text") as well.
