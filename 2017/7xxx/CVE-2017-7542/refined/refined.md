  "CVE-2017-7542": {
    "description": "An integer overflow vulnerability in ip6_find_1stfragopt() function was found. A local attacker that has privileges (of CAP_NET_RAW) to open raw socket can cause an infinite loop inside the ip6_find_1stfragopt() function.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `ip6_find_1stfragopt()` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with CAP_NET_RAW privileges can cause an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "Local",
    "required_capabilities": [
      "CAP_NET_RAW capability"
    ],
     "more_info": "The vulnerability occurs in the ip6_find_1stfragopt() function, where a calculation involving the offset of IPv6 options can overflow. An attacker with CAP_NET_RAW privileges can craft a malicious IPv6 packet to trigger this overflow, causing an infinite loop and ultimately a denial of service."
