Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7546:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that certain PostgreSQL authentication methods were accepting empty passwords, despite the libpq client library refusing to transmit them. This discrepancy allowed clients not using libpq to connect using empty passwords, which should have been rejected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Authentication bypass:** The core issue is an authentication bypass. While the libpq library correctly refused to send empty passwords, the server-side authentication mechanisms, when not paired with libpq, were accepting them.
*   **Inconsistent behavior:** The vulnerability highlights a discrepancy between how libpq and the server handle empty passwords, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access:** A remote attacker could gain access to database accounts that were configured with empty passwords.
*   **Data breach:** An attacker with unauthorized access could potentially view, modify, or delete data within the database.
*   **Compromise of the database:** Successfully gaining access to a database account with an empty password can allow an attacker to compromise the database as a whole.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Non-Libpq clients:** Exploitation requires the use of a PostgreSQL client not using the libpq library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the PostgreSQL server's network port.
*   **Valid user with empty password:** The attacker needs to target a user account with an empty password configured on the server.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** They need to be aware that empty passwords are accepted by the server and use a client that doesn't filter out empty passwords.

**Additional notes from the content:**

*   The fix disables empty passwords from being submitted in any of the password-based authentication methods.
*   The server will now reject empty passwords from being set on accounts.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in various PostgreSQL versions (9.2.22, 9.3.18, 9.4.13, 9.5.8, 9.6.4) as well as in several Red Hat products.
