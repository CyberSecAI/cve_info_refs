Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the PAN-OS Captive Portal, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the captive portal page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is specifically an XSS issue, which falls under CWE-79. This means the application is vulnerable to injecting malicious scripts into the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the captive portal page.
    *   Potentially performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network based. Attackers can inject malicious code through the captive portal page when it's configured in a vulnerable way.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They simply need to be able to interact with a captive portal page configured in a vulnerable manner. User interaction is required. The attacker relies on the user visiting the captive portal page.

**Affected versions:**

* PAN-OS 8.0.6-h3 and earlier.

**Solution:**
* Upgrade to PAN-OS 8.0.7 or later.

**Workarounds:**
* If the Captive Portal function is not being used, the system is not affected.
