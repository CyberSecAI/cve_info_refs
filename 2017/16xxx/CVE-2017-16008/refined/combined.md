### @KJTsanaktsidis **[KJTsanaktsidis](/KJTsanaktsidis)** commented [Oct 18, 2015](#issue-112003583)

The interpolation resolution code inside translate.js is looping over

each key in the interpolation dictionary and applying the replacements

one at a time. This means that if untrusted user input contains the name

of another key in the dictionary, for example `'__lastName__'`, an

unexpected interpolation can happen:

```
i18n.t('__firstName__ __lastName__', {
    firstName: '__lastName__',
    lastName: 'foo',
});
// equals "foo foo"

```

This combines with the unescaping suffix feature to cause XSS injection,

even with escapeInterpolation set to true. For example,

```
i18n.t('__firstName__ __lastName__', {
    escapeInterpolation: true,
    firstName: '__lastNameHTML__',
    lastName: '<script>',
});
// equals "<script> &lt;script&gt;"

```

This PR fixes that by performing the replacements *all at the same

time*. This means that untrusted input cannot cause these unexpected

extra interpolations.

Sorry, something went wrong.
