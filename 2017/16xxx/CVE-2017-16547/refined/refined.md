Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16547:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a defective memory allocation when processing a crafted file. Specifically, the issue lies in how GraphicsMagick handles "pop" keywords during image processing within the `DrawImage` function. The code attempts to process the `pop` keyword, but a flaw in pointer computation leads to an attempt to copy a string with an invalid size which can lead to negative values, resulting in out of bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** GraphicsMagick fails to properly validate input related to "pop" keywords in image files, allowing for a crafted input to trigger the flawed memory allocation.
*   **Incorrect Pointer Calculation:** The code incorrectly calculates the size of the string to copy using `strncpy`, possibly leading to a negative size.
*  **Out-of-bounds Memory Access:** Due to the incorrect pointer calculation, the code attempts to copy data to a memory location beyond the intended buffer, possibly triggering a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, where the application crashes due to the flawed memory operation.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** There is a possibility of other, unspecified impacts due to memory corruption, though the details are not provided.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through processing of a specially crafted image file that contains a malicious "pop" keyword in its drawing instructions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to provide or have a user process a specially crafted image file using GraphicsMagick. This could be through a web application, email attachment, or any other means where the application processes user-provided image files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this issue involved a modification to `magick/render.c` to check that `p+5U` is not greater than `q` before performing the `strncpy` operation.

*   The vulnerability was present in older versions of GraphicsMagick, as indicated by the fix included in the Debian LTS update for Wheezy (1.3.16-1.1+deb7u15) and Jessie (1.3.20-3+deb8u4), and the Debian security update (DSA 4321-1).
*   The fix was released in GraphicsMagick commit `785758bbbfcc` on October 28, 2017.

*   The vulnerability was tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla as bug 1494552, which included other CVEs related to GraphicsMagick, and was fixed in `GraphicsMagick-1.3.32-1.fc30` for Fedora.
