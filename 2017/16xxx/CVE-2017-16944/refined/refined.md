{
    "CVE-2017-16944": {
        "Root cause": "Exim does not properly handle BDAT data headers, specifically it continues to scan for a '.' to mark end of mail even within BDAT data, and fails to reset the receive_getc function pointer after a BDAT command leading to an incorrect state",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Improper handling of BDAT data headers",
            "Failure to reset function pointer after BDAT command"
        ],
        "Impact": "Remote attacker can cause Exim to crash, resulting in a denial of service. Can also lead to infinite loop, causing a resource based DoS attack.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Sending crafted BDAT commands to the Exim server"
        ],
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send SMTP commands to the Exim server."
    }
