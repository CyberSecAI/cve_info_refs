This content is related to a directory traversal vulnerability, and the file path `NPM-Vuln-PoC/tree/master/directory-traversal/fast-http-cli` strongly suggests it's related to CVE-2017-16155, which is a directory traversal vulnerability in the `fast-http-cli` package.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `fast-http-cli` package is vulnerable to directory traversal. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended web root, by using special characters such as `..` in the file path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server that the vulnerable application has access to, leading to exposure of confidential data.
- Server Compromise: In some cases, directory traversal can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to gain further access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. Specifically the path being requested to the fast-http-cli application contains `..` to traverse up directories

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to know how to construct a directory traversal payload.
