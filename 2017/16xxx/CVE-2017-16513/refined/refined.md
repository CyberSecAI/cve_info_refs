  "technical_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing an input string longer than 779 characters, which causes a crash. After an offset of 840 characters, it's possible to overwrite the SEH and hijack the execution flow. The proof of concept python script generates a text file with a string that overwrites the SEH.",
