The provided content relates to CVE-2017-16088.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that Node.js's native `vm` module does not prevent access to the Node.js standard library from within the sandboxed environment.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is present because the `vm` module does not properly isolate the sandboxed environment from the host's Node.js environment. Specifically, the `this.constructor.constructor('return process')()` construct within the sandboxed code can be used to obtain a reference to the `process` object, which can then be used to execute arbitrary code outside of the sandbox by calling `process.exit()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by causing the Node.js process to exit. It could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the Node.js `vm` module sandbox. An attacker can use the `this.constructor.constructor` method to access the host's `process` object, allowing for external code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the Node.js `vm` module. This could be achieved through a web application that allows users to submit JavaScript code to be evaluated.
