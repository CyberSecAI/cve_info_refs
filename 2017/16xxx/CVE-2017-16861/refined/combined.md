### Description

It was possible for double OGNL evaluation in certain redirect action and in WebWork URL and Anchor tags in JSP files to occur. An attacker who can access the web interface of Fisheye or Crucible or who hosts a website that a user who can access the web interface of Fisheye or Crucible visits, is able to exploit this vulnerability to execute Java code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Fisheye or Crucible.

**Affected versions:**

* All versions of Fisheye and Crucible before 4.4.5 (the fixed version for 4.4.x) and from 4.5.0 before 4.5.2 (the fixed version for 4.5.x) are affected by this vulnerability.

**Fix:**

* Fisheye version 4.5.2 is available to download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/download>.
* Crucible version 4.5.2 is available to download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/download>.
* Fisheye version 4.4.5 is available to download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/download-archives>.
* Crucible version 4.4.5 is available to download from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/download-archives>.
