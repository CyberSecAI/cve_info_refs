Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the possibility of double OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) evaluation within specific redirect actions and in WebWork URL and Anchor tags within JSP files of Fisheye and Crucible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double OGNL evaluation: This allows an attacker to inject malicious OGNL expressions that will be evaluated twice by the application.
- Insecure handling of redirects and URL/Anchor tags: The application does not adequately sanitize or validate user-controlled input used in redirects and URL/Anchor tags, leading to OGNL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary Java code on the server running a vulnerable version of Fisheye or Crucible. This grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web interface access: An attacker with access to the Fisheye or Crucible web interface can directly exploit the vulnerability.
- Malicious website hosting: An attacker can host a malicious website that, when visited by a user who also has access to the web interface of Fisheye or Crucible, can trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the vulnerable Fisheye or Crucible instance.
- For indirect attacks: The attacker needs to host a website and convince a user that has access to the vulnerable Fisheye or Crucible instance to visit it.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of Fisheye and Crucible prior to 4.4.5 (the fixed version for the 4.4.x branch).
- Versions 4.5.0 and 4.5.1

**Fixed Versions:**
- Fisheye and Crucible versions 4.4.5 and 4.5.2.

**Mitigation:**
- No direct mitigation is available other than upgrading to a fixed version

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as critical severity by Atlassian.
- The advisory was released on January 31, 2018.
