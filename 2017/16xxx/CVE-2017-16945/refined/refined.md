Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-16945

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `arq_updater` binary of the Arq application, which has the setuid bit set and is owned by root, allowing it to be executed with root privileges. The `arq_updater` is designed to install updates and accepts a file path as an argument. The vulnerability is that the application doesn't properly validate this path, which can be abused to install a malicious update from an attacker-controlled location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure setuid binary:** The `arq_updater` binary runs with root privileges.
- **Path traversal/Insecure file handling:** The application accepts a user-supplied file path without proper validation, enabling the attacker to point to a malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a local, unprivileged attacker to escalate their privileges to root, giving them complete control over the system. The attacker can achieve this by replacing a legitimate binary within the application with a malicious one and then triggering its execution with elevated permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local exploitation:** The attacker must have local access to the system where Arq is installed.
- **Malicious file path:** The attacker provides a crafted file path to `arq_updater` pointing to a malicious application update.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local user access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the file system.
- The attacker must be able to execute shell scripts.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit script provided by Exploit-DB automates the following steps:

1.  **Checks Vulnerability:** Verifies if auto-updates are enabled by checking the permissions on the vulnerable `arq_updater` binary and if a backup is in progress.
2.  **Creates Payload:**
    - Copies the Arq application directory to a temporary location.
    - Creates a shell script `payload.sh` to kill and relaunch the Arq application.
    - Creates a malicious `shell.c` file that replaces the standardrestorer binary in the Arq resources directory with a setuid root copy. This shell.c file replaces the target binary of standardrestorer and sets the permissions.
    - Compiles `shell.c` and moves the new binary as `standardrestorer` to the application resources.
    - Creates a zip archive of modified Arq Application.
3.  **Triggers Update:** Calls the `arq_updater` binary and passes the crafted archive for update installation.
4.  **Exploitation:** The `standardrestorer` binary executes with root privileges and runs payload.sh. The payload.sh kills the main Arq process and restarts the main Arq application.

The `standardrestorer` is used as a means to execute the attacker's `payload.sh`, and then exits. When the Arq application is reopened, it runs the `standardrestorer` with root privileges, which ultimately runs the `payload.sh`.

This exploit method abuses an update mechanism for Arq to replace its binary and then elevates privileges to root.
