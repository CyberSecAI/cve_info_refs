Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-16510:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way WordPress's `$wpdb->prepare()` function handles user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, specifically when user input is passed to the `$query` parameter of the `prepare` function, even after escaping. This is particularly dangerous when nested or "double" `prepare()` calls are made.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Double Preparation:** The core vulnerability involves "double-preparing" a query string. This occurs when the output of one `$wpdb->prepare()` call, which still contains `%s` placeholders, is passed as the query string to another `$wpdb->prepare()` call.  The second prepare call misinterprets the already present `%s` placeholder and can inject SQL.
2.  **Unsafe Use of Placeholders:** The vulnerability existed because `sprintf` also accepts `%c` which acts like `chr()` allowing an attacker to convert a decimal digit into a character. This combined with positional placeholders like `%1$s`, allowed for SQL injection when crafted input was provided.
3.  **Insecure User Input in Query:** The vulnerability is primarily due to passing user-controlled data, even when "escaped" to the query parameter of `->prepare()`.
4.  **Improper Fix:** The initial fix in WordPress 4.8.2, which removed support for all but `%d`, `%s`, and `%F` placeholders, broke many existing plugins and themes that relied on positional placeholders. It also was not a fix of the core problem of passing user-input to the query side of prepare.
5.  **Escaping Issues:** The `esc_sql()` function had inconsistent behaviors when handling the  `%` character, which was fixed to prevent accidental injection during query construction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches by reading sensitive information from the database.
    *   Data modification by altering, adding, or deleting data in the database.
    *   Privilege escalation by creating new administrator accounts.
    *   Complete compromise of the WordPress site by executing malicious queries.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In cases where the user controlled the user ID, this could be used for privilege escalations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:** The attack vector is primarily through user-provided input that is not properly handled when constructing SQL queries. This input can come from various sources, such as:
    *   GET/POST parameters.
    *   Database fields or data that is fetched and used in further queries.
    *   Data passed to functions that construct queries.
*   **Double `prepare()` Calls**: The vulnerability can be triggered when `prepare()` is called on an SQL string that has already been prepared.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Input Parameters:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input data that is used by the vulnerable application when building SQL queries.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code Paths:** The attacker needs to be aware of code locations where user-provided data is passed unsafely to the `prepare()` method, especially when double preparation happens.
*   **Understanding of `sprintf` Syntax**: A basic understanding of the way `sprintf` handles positional and character parameters is required to craft a successful SQL injection.

**Mitigation:**

*   **WordPress Core Fix (4.8.3):** WordPress addressed this vulnerability by modifying the `wpdb::prepare()` function. This includes:
    *   Escaping all `%` characters with a unique placeholder string.
    *   Restoring the correct `%` characters after prepare, but before the query is executed.
    *   Reintroducing support for positional placeholders, however with extra checks to ensure the correct number of arguments are being passed.
    *   Modifying `esc_sql` to handle the `%` character in a safe way.
*   **Plugin and Theme Developers:** Plugin and theme developers are advised to ensure that they never pass user-provided input to the `$query` parameter in `->prepare()`, and never perform "double prepares".
*   **General Security Practices**: In general, user input should never be passed directly to an SQL query. Prepared statements should be used, passing user input as parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Anthony Ferrara ([ircmaxell](https://twitter.com/ircmaxell)), who also provided detailed analysis and remediation advice.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4090-1) and the WordPress 4.8.3 security release address this vulnerability.
*   The correct fix is to move to real prepared statements, not emulated ones. This would involve using PDO/MySQLi and returning statement objects.
