Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a bypassable fingerprint authentication mechanism in the MECO USB Memory Stick with Fingerprint (MECOZiolsamDE601). The device incorrectly handles access control, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the flawed implementation of access control. Instead of relying on secure fingerprint authentication, the device can be unlocked using a static packet sent through a serial port.
- **Lack of proper authentication:** The fingerprint authentication mechanism can be bypassed completely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the device's data, effectively escalating their privileges.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can access all data stored on the device, leading to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the USB key.
- **Serial Port Exploitation:** The attacker must send a specific static packet through a serial port on the device's PCB.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs to have physical possession of the USB key.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability, how to access the serial port on the PCB, and how to send the correct static packet.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Remi Audebert, Jean-Michel Picod, and Elie Bursztein.
- The exploit involves sending a static packet to a serial port exposed on the PCB to unlock the key.
- The researchers presented their findings at Black Hat USA 2017.
