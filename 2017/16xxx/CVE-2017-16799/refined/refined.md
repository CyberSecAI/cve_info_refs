The provided content relates to CVE-2017-16799.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the "add category" functionality of the News module within CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) version 2.2.3.1. Specifically, the `name` parameter, which is used for the category name, is directly inserted into the database without proper filtering or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the category name, an attacker can store it in the database. When this data is later retrieved and displayed to other users, the malicious script will be executed within their browsers.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The root cause of the XSS vulnerability is the absence of input sanitization or output encoding. The application fails to neutralize user-supplied input before storing it in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- Session Hijacking: The attacker could potentially steal user cookies or session tokens, leading to session hijacking.
- Defacement: Malicious scripts can be used to modify the content of the website for users, potentially defacing the site.
- Phishing: The attacker can redirect users to phishing sites or display fake login forms to steal credentials.
- Malware Distribution: The attacker can also use the vulnerability to distribute malware to users of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack is carried out through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/moduleinterface.php` endpoint. The attacker manipulates the `m1_name` parameter within this request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to CMS Admin Panel: The attacker must have the ability to access and interact with the admin panel of the CMSMS installation.
- Knowledge of Target Endpoint: The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint (`/admin/moduleinterface.php`) and the parameters needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Ability to Craft HTTP Requests: The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests, including specific parameters, to exploit the lack of input validation.
