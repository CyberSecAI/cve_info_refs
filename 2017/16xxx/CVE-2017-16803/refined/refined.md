Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-16803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `smacker_decode_tree` function within the Libav library, specifically a missing sanity check related to the tree length. This function is used to decode Smacker video streams.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing length check:** The `smacker_decode_tree` function lacked a check to prevent excessively long tree recursion. This could lead to stack exhaustion if a crafted Smacker stream with a deeply nested tree structure was provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a maliciously crafted Smacker stream. The excessive recursion could lead to stack exhaustion and crash the application using the library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Smacker stream:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a malicious Smacker video stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted Smacker stream to an application using the vulnerable version of Libav. This could be through a media file, network stream, or any other method where libav is used to decode smacker streams.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves adding a sanity check within `smacker_decode_tree` to limit recursion depth using `SMKTREE_DECODE_MAX_RECURSION`.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201811-19) explicitly mentions that the vulnerability allows for a "Denial of Service condition" through a crafted Smacker stream.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4119-1) also confirms that CVE-2017-16803 was fixed in libav, referring to the changelog and security tracker for further details.
*   The Github commit message states "smacker: add sanity check for length in smacker_decode_tree()", confirming the fix.
