- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `userDesc` parameter in the User Profile section of Synology Surveillance Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML code into the user profile, which could be executed when another user views the profile. This can lead to actions performed on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the `userDesc` parameter within the user profile settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user of the Synology Surveillance Station. The attacker also needs to trick the victim user into viewing the attacker's user profile to trigger the XSS payload.
