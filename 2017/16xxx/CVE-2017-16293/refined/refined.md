{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `strcpy` function is used to copy data from a JSON value string to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary data on the stack, including saved registers and the return address, leading to arbitrary code execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a specially crafted JSON message through the PubNub service using an authenticated HTTP request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send authenticated HTTP requests to the device's PubNub interface. This typically requires a valid authentication key and the device's specific channel ID."
