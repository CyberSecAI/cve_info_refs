Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-16949

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization in the "Accesspress Anonymous Post Pro" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to adequately validate and sanitize user-provided settings related to allowed file extensions and upload file size. This allows an attacker to override these restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files, including malicious ones like PHP scripts, due to the improper sanitization of file upload settings.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate the 'allowedExtensions' and 'sizeLimit' parameters, allowing attackers to inject their own values. This bypasses the intended file type and size restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the website and its underlying server, allowing the attacker to potentially access sensitive information, deface the site, or use it as a launchpad for further attacks.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** With RCE, an attacker can gain full control of the system, allowing them to steal sensitive data, install backdoors, and use the server for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The request uses `multipart/form-data` to send the malicious file along with overridden parameters for allowed file extensions (`allowedExtensions[]=php`) and size limits (`sizeLimit=64000`).
*   **Targeted Endpoint:** The specific target endpoint is  `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ap_file_upload_action`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be performed without authentication. This allows any attacker to initiate the file upload process.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker must know that the "Accesspress Anonymous Post Pro" plugin is installed and vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin Version:** The vulnerable version is identified as any version prior to 3.2.0.
*   **Exploit Author:** The exploit was authored by Colette Chamberland from Defiant.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to send a malicious PHP file to the server through a POST request, overriding the allowed file extensions and size limits.
*   **File Extension Override**: The attacker can specify a PHP extension by including `allowedExtensions[]=php` in the POST request.
*   **Size Limit Override**: The attacker can change the size limit using `sizeLimit=64000` within the POST request.
