Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `LZWReadByte` function of the `gifread.c` file within OptiPNG. This is due to an uncontrolled loop when processing specially crafted GIF format files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The uncontrolled loop in `LZWReadByte` allows writing beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can cause a denial-of-service condition, making the affected system or service unavailable.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** The vulnerability can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the affected process. This is mentioned in the Gentoo advisory but is not explicitly stated in the Debian LTS advisory, although it's mentioned as a potential consequence.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to process a maliciously crafted GIF file with OptiPNG.
- **Malicious GIF File:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted GIF file designed to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or trick the victim into processing a malicious GIF file through OptiPNG.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of OptiPNG prior to 0.7.6-r2 (Gentoo) and the patched versions for Debian (0.7.5-1+deb8u2 for Jessie, 0.7.6-1+deb9u1 for Stretch, and 0.6.4-1+deb7u4 for Wheezy).
- Both Gentoo and Debian released security advisories and updates to address this issue.
- The Debian LTS advisory specifies a denial of service but does not explicitly mention potential arbitrary code execution as stated in the Gentoo advisory.
- The provided Gentoo advisory mentions CVE-2017-1000229 as another related vulnerability in OptiPNG.
