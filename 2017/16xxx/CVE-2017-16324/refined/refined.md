This document provides detailed information on multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-16324, found in the Insteon Hub's PubNub message handler.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the use of the `strcpy` function to copy data from a JSON message into fixed-size stack buffers without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer, overwriting adjacent memory on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` with unconstrained input from a JSON message.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the size of the input string before copying it into the fixed-size buffers.
- **Multiple Vulnerable Locations:** This vulnerability is not isolated, there are many locations within the code that use `strcpy` in this unsafe manner.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack, an attacker can overwrite saved registers (s-registers), saved return address ($ra), and saved frame pointer ($fp). This allows for arbitrary code execution by redirecting program flow, giving the attacker control over the device.
- **Device Crash:** Overwriting the stack can also lead to a device crash if the overwritten memory contains critical program data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, targeting the device's PubNub interface.
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the PubNub service. These requests include a JSON message with an oversized string for one of the parameters.
- **PubNub Channel:** The target channel is "cc", which is used by the device to receive commands from the Insteon mobile application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to publish messages on the device's PubNub channel. This is achieved through the use of an `auth-key` included in the HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of PubNub API:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to interact with PubNub's API (publish/subscribe methods).
- **Knowledge of Device's Channel and Authentication Key:** The attacker must know the target device's channel name (e.g., "112233-cc") and a valid authentication key.

**Details Specific to CVE-2017-16324:**

- **Vulnerable Code Location:** At address 0x9d01e368, the value of the `s_group_vol` key from a JSON message is copied using `strcpy` into a 32 byte buffer located at `$sp+0x2b0` on the stack.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
  ```json
  {"cmd": "s_sonos", "s_group": "x", "s_group_vol": "OVERFLOW"}
  ```
- **Impact:** Overflows the 32 byte buffer on the stack.
- **Affected Command:** The vulnerable code path is triggered when the "cmd" value is equal to "s_sonos".
