Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Photo Viewer within Synology Photo Station that exposes private information through the map viewer mode.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of metadata from password-protected photographs. This happens when viewing photos in the map viewer mode.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote attackers can obtain sensitive metadata from password-protected photos. This is a privacy breach, as the metadata might contain information that users intended to keep private (e.g. location data).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote and involves the map viewer mode in Photo Station.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be remote and does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary:** This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to obtain metadata from password-protected photographs by using the map viewer feature in Synology Photo Station. This constitutes a privacy breach due to the exposure of sensitive data.
