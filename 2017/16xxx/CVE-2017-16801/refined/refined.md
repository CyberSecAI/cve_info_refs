Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16801:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Step Template Name" parameter within Octopus Deploy. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a Stored XSS as the malicious payload is stored in the step template name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This can lead to:
- Account compromise: Stealing session cookies and login credentials.
- Phishing: Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
- Defacement: Modifying the user interface.
- Information disclosure: Accessing sensitive information within the application.
- Further attacks: Using the compromised account for other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
1. Creating a custom step template with a malicious script in its name.
2. Importing a step template containing a malicious name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Octopus Deploy.
- The attacker needs the ability to create or import step templates.
- Low privileges are required, based on the CVSS score.
