# Back In Time: Command injection — GLSA **201801-06**

A command injection vulnerability in 'Back in Time' may allow for
the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-backup/backintime** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.24** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.24** |

### Background

A simple backup tool for Linux, inspired by “flyback project”.

### Description

‘Back in Time’ did improper escaping/quoting of file paths used as
arguments to the ‘notify-send’ command leading to some parts of file
paths being executed as shell commands within an os.system call.

### Impact

A context-dependent attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands via
a specially crafted file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ‘Back In Time’ users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-backup/backintime-1.1.24"

```

# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your GitHub account as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

## Description

[![@nodiscc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3950390?v=4&size=48)](/nodiscc)[nodiscc](https://github.com/nodiscc)opened [on Nov 7, 2017](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/834#issue-271934046)

Backintime 1.1.12-2 (Debian stable)

Hi, this is a bug I noticed when trying to backup a file my user didn't have read permissions on. Normally a desktop notification ([`notify-send`](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/blob/42f9f1e75c1138b553f15eb95a24899bd4210b3e/qt/plugins/notifyplugin.py)) would be displayed containing the path of the problematic file.

However in some cases, parts of the log message are treated as shell commands. For example

```
# under 1st user account (user1, www-data...)
user1@machine $ touch /mnt/backup_source/afile\ \(1\).txt
user1@machine $ chmod 0600 /mnt/backup_source/afile\ \(1\).txt # not needed if default umask/filemode is 0600
# under second user account
# set backintime to backup the /mnt/backup_source/ directory, and
maintenance@machine $ backintime backup
Version: 1.1.12
[...]
INFO: Call rsync to take the snapshot
notify-send  "Back In Time (dbu) : Profil principal" "Error: rsync: send_files failed to open "/mnt/backup_source/afile (1).txt": Permission denied (13)"
sh: 1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
[...]
INFO: Unlock
INFO: Release inhibit Suspend
```

Other errors also trigger this bug (example with a filesystem error:)

```
notify-send  "Back In Time (dbu) : Profil principal" "Error: rsync: readlink_stat("/mnt/audio/Volterock & undocument - Vocal Hazard Pack Vol 2/Von Volterock/Dieing 10.wav") failed: Structure needs cleaning (117)"
sh: 1: undocument: command not found

```
