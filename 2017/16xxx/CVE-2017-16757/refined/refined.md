- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure permission misconfiguration in the Hola VPN v1.34 client software. Specifically, the "Everyone" group has full (F) control permissions on several files and directories within the installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Hola`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Local Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows a local attacker to gain higher privileges than initially assigned by modifying critical executable files.
    - **Insecure Permissions:**  The "Everyone" group having full access to key executable files (`7za.exe`, `hola.exe`, `hola_svc.exe`, etc.) and directories allows an attacker to replace these files with malicious ones.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **System Process Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to the compromise of system processes.
    - **Operating System Compromise:**  The attacker can further manipulate or exploit the compromised processes to gain full control of the local computer.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Local access:** Attackers must have local access to the system where Hola VPN is installed.
    - **File replacement:** The attack vector involves replacing legitimate executable files with malicious ones by taking advantage of the insecure permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Low-privilege system user account:** The attacker needs a low-privilege user account on the local system.
    - **No user interaction:** The exploit does not require any user interaction to be successful.
