The provided content describes a presentation on TPM attacks, and while not directly associated with a CVE, it is closely related to security vulnerabilities in TPMs and their implementations. It details two distinct TPM attacks related to power management:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **Design Flaw in TPM 2.0 Specification (SRTM Attack):** The attack exploits a design flaw in the TPM 2.0 specification regarding the static root of trust for measurement (SRTM). The specific nature of this flaw is not described in detail in this summary, but it allows for the manipulation of platform configuration registers.
2.  **Implementation Flaw in tboot:** The second attack exploits an implementation vulnerability in tboot, a measured launch environment commonly used with Intel's Trusted Execution Technology (TXT). Again, specifics of the flaw are not given in the summary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is the ability to reset and forge Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). PCRs are meant to securely store measurements of software used for bootstrapping a computer and are a critical part of a hardware root of trust.
*   The attacks circumvent the integrity checks provided by the TPM by manipulating PCRs during power management procedures

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An adversary can forge the measurements of the software used to boot the computer, thereby subverting the platform's security and gaining control of the system during the boot process.
*   The SRTM attack is particularly concerning because it requires hardware-specific firmware patches to remediate, which could take considerable time to deploy. This implies a widespread vulnerability across affected devices.
*   Potentially, this can lead to complete control over the system, including data and applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacks focus on power management, implying a physical or near-physical access requirement, or an access vector that gives enough control over the power management of the system.
*   The attacks involve manipulating the TPM during power transitions or low-power states.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have enough control over the system to manipulate its power management functions, this could be: physical access to the machine, or some form of remote access that exposes low level power controls of the target device.
*   The attacker needs to be able to perform the described attacks during system boot or power state transitions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The paper demonstrates the attacks on commodity hardware which suggests that the vulnerabilities affect commonly used devices.
*   The provided document does not reference any CVE.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it details specific attacks on TPMs beyond the broad overview of a vulnerability.
