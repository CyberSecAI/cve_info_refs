Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability via HTTP, which allows an authenticated administrator to execute arbitrary code on the device. The specific vulnerable vector was not disclosed in the CVE description, and the provided content does not reveal it directly. However, it mentions that the vulnerability was related to how the devices handled user-provided input when making system calls. 

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The device fails to properly sanitize user input before passing it to system commands.
- HTTP vulnerability: The vulnerability is exposed through HTTP interface.
- Authenticated Access: Exploitation requires authentication as an administrator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device, effectively gaining full control.
- System Compromise:  An attacker could potentially use this to pivot into other network devices, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities.
- Complete Device takeover: With arbitrary code execution, an attacker can modify device functionalities, install persistent backdoors, and potentially brick the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Requests: Attackers craft malicious HTTP requests that include injected commands within the parameters.
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Administrator Credentials: The attacker needs valid administrator credentials to log in to the device's web interface.
- Network Access: The attacker must have network access to the device, as the exploitation involves sending HTTP requests to the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched by Crestron in firmware version 1.6.0 for AM-100 devices and 2.7.0 for AM-101 devices.
- According to the advisory, analysis of other similar devices indicated that they may not have patched this vulnerability.
- The original patch aimed to filter out operating system commands but failed, requiring further fixes to fully address the issue.
