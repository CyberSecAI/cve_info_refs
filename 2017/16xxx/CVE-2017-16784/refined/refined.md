Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-16784:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `cntnt01detailtemplate` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application echoes the attacker-controlled `cntnt01detailtemplate` parameter in the response without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the web page, which can then be executed by a user who clicks a specially crafted link.
- This could lead to various impacts such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Other client-side attacks against the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a specially crafted URL.
- The malicious script is injected via the `cntnt01detailtemplate` GET parameter of the `index.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious XSS payload in the `cntnt01detailtemplate` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the crafted URL. This could be done through various means such as social engineering, phishing, or by posting it on forums.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is in CMS Made Simple, version 2.2.2
- The vulnerable parameter name is `cntnt01detailtemplate`, which takes a GET request
- The proof of concept shows the injected script is `alert(0x001168)`
- The provided proof of concept payload is: `%2527%2522--%253E%253C%252Fstyle%253E%253C%252FscRipt%253E%253CscRipt%253Ealert%25280x001168%2529%253C%252FscRipt%253E`
- The solution is to properly encode the output based on the output location and context, preventing the browser from interpreting it as active HTML, JavaScript or VBScript.
