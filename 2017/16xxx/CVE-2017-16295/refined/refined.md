{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Insteon Hub firmware uses the `strcpy` function to copy data from JSON messages received via PubNub into fixed-size buffers on the stack without proper bounds checking. The size of the source string is not validated against the destination buffer size, leading to buffer overflows if the source string is larger than the destination buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in multiple message handlers within the PubNub \"cc\" channel.",
    "Use of `strcpy` without bounds checking.",
    "Lack of input validation on the size of JSON string values."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary data on the stack by sending specially crafted JSON messages. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing complete control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the PubNub service, which contains a JSON string with an oversized value for one of the vulnerable keys. The request needs to be authenticated using the device's auth key, implying that the attacker needs to know this key. This key is the MAC address of the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the device's PubNub publish and subscribe keys, the device's Insteon ID (lower 3 octets of the MAC address), and the auth key (MAC address). The attacker is required to be on the network or have a method of communicating with the device via the internet."
