{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The SSH service on the affected MitraStar routers is misconfigured, allowing users to execute arbitrary commands by specifying `/bin/sh` as the command upon connecting, bypassing the default restricted shell.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure SSH configuration",
        "Lack of proper access control for SSH commands"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can gain root privileges on the affected routers, enabling them to execute arbitrary commands, copy files from the router, and potentially take complete control.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the router's SSH service (port 22)"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Valid username and password for SSH access (default credentials often printed on the device)",
        "Ability to establish an SSH connection to the target device"
      ],
        "additional_information": "Some MitraStar routers may have an additional user, 'zyad1234', with the same password and root privileges as the '1234' user."
