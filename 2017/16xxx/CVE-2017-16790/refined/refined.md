Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Symfony Form component's request handler merges POST data and uploaded file data into a single array during form submission. This means that after this merge, there's no distinction between regular POST data and uploaded file data.
- A user can exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP request where the value for a `FileType` form field is sent as regular POST data that could be interpreted as a local file path on the server (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **File Path Injection/Exposure**: By submitting a crafted path as form data intended for file uploads, an attacker could potentially trigger the server to attempt to access arbitrary files on the server, leading to information disclosure.
- **Lack of Input Validation**: The `FileType` did not sufficiently validate if the submitted data was indeed an uploaded file, allowing the crafted POST data to be processed as if it were a file.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although the primary issue isn't direct file content exposure, the validation message from `FileConstraint` could reveal whether a file exists on the server, potentially disclosing server technologies/structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially determine if specific files exist on the server due to the file validation messages. Although not direct file content exposure, this can still reveal internal server information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted HTTP Request:** An attacker sends a malicious HTTP POST request to a vulnerable Symfony application. The request would contain the malicious file path as part of the form data, targeting a `FileType` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable form**: The attacker needs to identify a form that uses `FileType` within the application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for this issue involves adding an `isFileUpload()` method to the `RequestHandlerInterface`, which is then called by `FileType` to verify that the handled data is indeed an uploaded file.
- The patch for this issue is available at: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/24993
- Affected versions of Symfony are 2.7.0 to 2.7.37, 2.8.0 to 2.8.30, 3.2.0 to 3.2.13, and 3.3.0 to 3.3.12.
- The fix is included in Symfony versions 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5, and 4.0-BETA5.
- No fixes were provided for Symfony 3.0 and 3.1 as they are not maintained anymore.
- The addition of the `isFileUpload()` method is a BC break for versions 2.7 and up, requiring updates to any code that implements the `RequestHandlerInterface`.
