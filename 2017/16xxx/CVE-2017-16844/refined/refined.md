  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-16844",
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in procmail's formail utility. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted email that, when processed by formail, could cause formail to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running formail.",
    "affected_components": [
      "procmail"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `loadbuf` function in `formisc.c` within procmail's `formail` utility has a heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient buffer resizing when processing specially crafted email headers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running formail.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted email to be processed by the vulnerable `formail` utility.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send email that is processed by the vulnerable software.",
    "additional_information": [
        "The vulnerable code is in the loadbuf function in formisc.c.",
        "The buffer is resized by a fixed size (128 bytes) which is insufficient",
        "The vulnerability is triggered during email header processing.",
        "The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
        "The fix involves a loop that continues to reallocate the buffer until it's large enough to hold the data.",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 5, 6, and 7 are affected, but Red Hat does not plan to address the issue in RHEL 5 or 6.",
        "Debian versions wheezy, jessie, and stretch are affected, with fixes released.",
        "The vulnerability was found using American Fuzzy Lop."
