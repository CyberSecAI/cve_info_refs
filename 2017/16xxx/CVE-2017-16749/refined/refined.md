The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16749.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition when processing specially crafted .dpb files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Use-after-free (CWE-416)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted .dpb files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted .dpb file to the vulnerable software. The CVSS vector string indicates the following:
-   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local): The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
-   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low): The attack complexity is low.
-   **PR:N** (Privileges Required: None): No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **UI:R** (User Interaction: Required): User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability, likely by opening the malicious .dpb file.
-   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged): The vulnerability does not change the security scope.
-   **C:N** (Confidentiality: None): There is no impact on data confidentiality.
-   **I:N** (Integrity: None): There is no impact on data integrity.
-   **A:H** (Availability: High): There is a high impact on availability, which can lead to denial of service or potentially remote code execution.
