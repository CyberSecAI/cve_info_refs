# Amazon Key Flaw Could Let Rogue Deliverymen Disable Your Camera

After hackers exposed a way to freeze the delivery service's security cameras, Amazon will push out a fix later this week.![This image may contain Electronics Camera Blow Dryer Dryer Appliance and Hair Drier](https://media.wired.com/photos/5a0ce8ca248a4f5897a21a02/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/AmazonKeyHack-TA.jpg)AmazonSave this storySaveSave this storySave

When Amazon launched its Amazon Key service last month, it also offered a remedy for anyone—realistically, most people—who might be creeped out that the service [gives random strangers unfettered access to your home](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-key-and-cloud-cam/). That security antidote? An internet-enabled camera called [Cloud Cam](https://www.wired.com/2017/11/review-amazon-cloud-camera/), designed to sit opposite your door and reassuringly record every Amazon Key delivery.

But now security researchers have demonstrated that with a simple program run from any computer in Wi-Fi range, that camera can be not only disabled but frozen. A viewer watching its live or recorded stream sees only a closed door, even as their actual door is opened and someone slips inside. That attack would potentially enable rogue delivery people to stealthily steal from Amazon customers, or otherwise invade their inner sanctum.

And while the threat of a camera-hacking courier seems an unlikely way for your house to be burgled, the researchers argue it potentially strips away a key safeguard in Amazon's security system. When WIRED brought the research to Amazon's attention, the company responded that it plans to send out an automatic software update to address the issue later this week.

"The camera is very much something Amazon is relying on in pitching the security of this as a safe solution," says Ben Caudill, the founder of the Seattle-based security firm Rhino Security Labs, whose researchers discovered and demonstrated the Amazon Key attack. "Disabling that camera on command is a pretty powerful capability when you’re talking about environments where you’re relying heavily on that being a critical safety mechanism."

Key Master

The Rhino Labs proof-of-concept attack on Amazon Key is relatively simple. In their demonstration, shown in the video above, a delivery person unlocks the door with their Amazon Key app, opens the door, drops off a package, and then closes the door behind them. Normally, they'd then lock the door with their app. In this attack, they instead run a program on their laptop—or, Rhino's researchers suggest, on a simple handheld device anyone could build using a Raspberry Pi minicomputer and an antenna—that sends a series of "deauthorization" commands to the home's Cloud Cam.

That so-called deauth technique isn't exactly a software bug in Cloud Cam. It's an issue for practically all Wi-Fi devices, one that allows anyone to spoof a command from a Wi-Fi router that temporarily kicks a device off the network. In this case, Rhino's script sends the command again and again, to keep the camera offline as long as the script is running. Most disturbingly, Amazon's camera doesn't respond to that attack by going dark or alerting the user that the camera is offline. Instead, it continues to show any live viewer—or anyone watching back a recording—the last frame the camera saw when it was connected.

> 'Disabling that camera on command is a pretty powerful capability.'

Ben Caudill, Rhino Labs

That means the deauth command sent by the delivery-person-turned-hacker standing just outside your door can freeze the camera on the image of a closed door, while he then waltzes in a second time and closes the door behind them. Once inside, the intruder can simply move beyond the view of the Cloud Cam, stop sending the deauth command to allow the camera to reconnect, and hit the lock button on their app. Neither the lock's logs nor the video record would appear amiss to the Amazon Key user, even as a stranger runs amok inside their house.

"As a partially trusted Amazon delivery person, you can compromise the security of anyone's house you have temporary access to without any logs or entries that would be unusual or suspicious," Caudill says.

"We currently notify customers if the camera is offline for an extended period," Amazon said in a statement. "Later this week we will deploy an update to more quickly provide notifications if the camera goes offline during delivery."

The company nonetheless downplayed the likelihood of its delivery staff actually exploiting Rhino's technique, and noted that it doesn't allow any staffer to unlock a door without being authorized to deliver a package at a certain address and time, even if the camera is disabled. Amazon also pointed out that it offers a Happiness Guarantee, and claimed—without any direct evidence—that it would be able to immediately identify any driver that did use the trick to break into someone's house.

"Every delivery driver passes a comprehensive background check that is verified by Amazon before they can make in-home deliveries, every delivery is connected to a specific driver, and before we unlock the door for a delivery, Amazon verifies that the correct driver is at the right address, at the intended time," the company's statement reads.

To Amazon's point, any delivery person who does exploit that trick for thievery or spying would still face some serious challenges. They'd be the prime suspect, so to speak, for any obvious burglary of the house, so they'd have to limit their crimes to subtler thefts, like copying sensitive documents for identity theft. And of course, they'd also have to find another way out of the house, since they'll have locked the front door behind them.

"At the point where you’re clever enough to do this, that’s the easy part of the problem," Caudill argues.

A Separate Attack

Rhino's researchers also point out that when their attack kicks a Cloud Cam off the network, it also disconnects the Amazon Key lock on the door, too. That's because the lock doesn't actually have its own internet connection. Instead, it communicates via the Zigbee wireless protocol to the Cloud Cam, which acts as its connection to the Wi-Fi router and the rest of the internet.

The researchers argue that this could enable a separate attack as well. In that scenario, a hacker follows an Amazon delivery person around and waits for them to make a delivery. Just as they're closing the door to leave, the hacker triggers the deauth command, knocking Amazon Key offline and preventing the door from locking. When the delivery person leaves, the hacker then breaks into the home through the unlocked door.

But that attack, while open to a far wider collection of potential hackers than the rogue delivery person scenario, is even less likely to succeed. The delivery person would have to be rushed or careless enough to not pull on the door to check that it was locked, and to not notice that their app showed an extended "locking" status message, a spinning icon, and then a timeout error. Amazon notes that its delivery people are told never to leave a house when its door is unlocked, and that the company will also call a customer immediately if it sees that their door is left unlocked for more than several minutes.

Caudill concedes that a rogue delivery person disabling someone's camera constitutes a more practical attack. And while he notes that an Amazon software update changes how an Amazon Key camera alerts customers that it's offline could limit the problem, he also argues that a full fix would require caching a certain amount of recording locally even when it's not connected to the internet, so that any mischievous door-opening is still captured even when the camera's offline.

Anything short of a compete fix, Caudill says, will only have even more serious implications as Amazon opens up Amazon Key to other services in the coming months. The company has said it plans to integrate the feature with cleaning service Merry Maids, dog-walking service Rover, and more.

In the meantime, wary users should consider setting up another, separate security camera as a backup for Amazon's Cloud Cam. They could, hypothetically, place a clock or other moving object in the frame of the Cloud Cam's view, so that any freezing of the image would become immediately apparent. Or Caudill offers a harsher but far simpler solution: "Don't use Amazon Key."

Last month, the world [was introduced to Amazon Key](/2017/10/25/16538834/amazon-key-in-home-delivery-unlock-door-prime-cloud-cam-smart-lock), a new service from the online shopping juggernaut that allows couriers to unlock your front door to deliver packages. One of the main concerns of the service is the central question of whether Prime customers trust Amazon enough to let the company monitor their homes and determine when it’s okay to unlock the door for someone who is, essentially, a stranger. The service relies on [Cloud Cam](/circuitbreaker/2017/10/25/16535002/amazon-cloud-cam-camera-alexa-key-in-home-delivery) and a compatible smart lock, and only grants permission for a courier to enter after they scan a barcode, which is checked against information in the cloud. A camera also monitors and records the drop-off so customers can check that nothing suspect happened.

Now security researchers have found that the camera can be disabled and frozen from a program run from any computer within Wi-Fi range, [reports *Wired*](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-key-flaw-let-deliverymen-disable-your-camera/). That means a customer watching a delivery will only see a closed door, even if someone opens the door and goes inside — a vulnerability that may allow rogue couriers to rob customers’ homes.

once the disabling program is run, the app shows the door remaining closed

"The camera is very much something Amazon is relying on in pitching the security of this as a safe solution," Ben Caudill, the founder of Rhino Security Labs told *Wired*. Researchers from the security firm uncovered the Amazon Key attack and replicated it. "Disabling that camera on command is a pretty powerful capability when you’re talking about environments where you’re relying heavily on that being a critical safety mechanism.”

The video demonstration of the attack shows a man dropping off a parcel inside a house. The Amazon Key app shows the delivery goes as normal and indicates the door is locked as the courier leaves. But once the disabling program is run, and the courier reenters the apartment, the app just shows the door remaining closed.

The demonstration is a proof-of-concept and a deauthorization technique. If the camera is turned off, even manually by the user, you do get a push notification a few minutes later saying it’s offline. Someone wanting to break into a home could follow an Amazon courier and wait for them to make a delivery. They could trigger a deauthorization command as the courier is leaving and cause Amazon Key to go offline, which would stop the door from locking.

But Amazon does have a process in place that’s meant to avoid these scenarios from happening; the courier has to unlock the door, leave, then manually relock, and the customer will get a notification when they do so. If a courier left and the door was not quickly locked again, the customer would know something is off, although an attack like this would prevent them from seeing exactly what happened. The courier also can’t move on to their next delivery, according to Amazon’s procedures, until the door has been locked and that step has been confirmed the cloud.

***UPDATE November 16th, 12:41pm ET:*** A spokesperson from Amazon says: “Safety and security are built into every aspect of the service. Every delivery driver passes a comprehensive background check that is verified by Amazon before they can make in-home deliveries, every delivery is connected to a specific driver, and before we unlock the door for a delivery, Amazon verifies that the correct driver is at the right address, at the intended time. We currently notify customers if the camera is offline for an extended period. Later this week we will deploy an update to more quickly provide notifications if the camera goes offline during delivery. The service will not unlock the door if the Wi-Fi is disabled and the camera is not online.”

An earlier version of this story said that Amazon’s camera doesn’t indicate to users that the camera is offline. That is incorrect.

# Amazon Key flaw could let a courier disable your Cloud Cam

## A new attack disables a crucial part of Amazon's Key security.

Amazon

Amazon recently [weirded out](https://www.google.com/search?q=amazon+key+is+a+bad+idea&oq=amazon+key+is+&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l4j69i64.4776j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) much of the internet when it unveiled its [Key delivery service](https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-25-amazon-key-service-delivery-access-unlock-door.html) that lets its couriers open your home and deliver packages while you're away. A key part of that is the [Cloud Cam](https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-25-amazons-home-security-cloud-cam-is-alexa-enabled.html) security camera that confirms deliveries and shows that your house remains un-ransacked. Now, researchers from Rhino Security Labs have shown that it's possible, under rare circumstances, to hack the camera so that everything looks fine while someone takes all your stuff.

The attack would work like this. A courier unlocks your door with their Key app, drops off the package and closes the door behind them. Rather than re-locking it, they then run a program on a custom-built device or laptop that spoofs the home's router and disconnects the Cloud Cam from the network. The device keeps sending the command to prevent the camera from reconnecting.

Unfortunately, the system doesn't alert you that the Cloud Cam is disconnected -- instead, the camera keeps sending the last image it recorded, a normal shot of your door. In the meantime, the hacker can re-enter the house, move out of camera range, lock the door behind them using the Key app, and stop the jamming app, as shown below. They're then free to rummage around your home, and neither you nor Amazon are any the wiser.

To view this content, you'll need to update your privacy settings. [Please click here](https://engadget.mydashboard.oath.com/guc-redirect?app=thirdPartyContentEmbed&bucket=pd_2&lang=en-US) and view the **"Content and social-media partners"** setting to do so.

This type of hack can work with any WiFi device, to be fair, but most WiFi devices aren't an integral part of a secure delivery system like the Cloud Cam is. "Disabling that camera on command is a pretty powerful capability when you're talking about environments where you're relying heavily on that being a critical safety mechanism," Rhino's Ben Caudill told *[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-key-flaw-let-deliverymen-disable-your-camera)*. The fact that the camera continues to show what looks like a normal image is perhaps the most significant flaw.

Amazon told Wired that it's extremely unlikely such an attack would work, however. Its couriers must pass comprehensive background checks, deliveries are connected to specific drivers, and the company "verifies that the correct driver is at the right address, at the right time."

So it would be pretty risky for a courier to steal something, and furthermore, they'd have to exit via another door or window as the front door would now be locked. It would be even tougher for a third-party to exploit the hack, as they'd have no way to open a door unless the courier was careless -- and if so, Amazon would contact the homeowner within minutes.

Nevertheless, Amazon has promised to address the issue. "Later this week, we will deploy an update to more quickly provide notifications if the camera goes offline during delivery," it said in a statement. In other words, Amazon should thank the hackers for helping them fix the hole, and hope that someone less forthright doesn't find another -- its Key service is a pretty tempting target.
