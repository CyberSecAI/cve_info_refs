```
Root cause of vulnerability: The SoundGraph iMON USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Improper validation of device metadata in the iMON USB driver.

Impact of exploitation: A physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (system crash).

Attack vectors: A physically proximate attacker can exploit this by using a specially crafted USB device.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs physical access to the target system and the ability to connect a malicious USB device.
