  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The CDC Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel does not validate the device's maximum segment size (wMaxSegmentSize) from the USB descriptors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of validation of the wMaxSegmentSize in USB device descriptors.",
      "Potential division by zero error in `usbnet_update_max_qlen` when `dev->hard_mtu` is zero."
    ],

      "A physically proximate attacker must connect a maliciously crafted USB device to the target system."
