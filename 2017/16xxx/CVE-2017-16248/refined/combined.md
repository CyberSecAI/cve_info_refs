# CVE-2017-16248

| **Name** | CVE-2017-16248 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The Catalyst-Plugin-Static-Simple module before 0.34 for Perl allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files if there is a '.' character anywhere in the pathname, which differs from the intended policy of allowing access only when the filename itself has a '.' character. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-16248) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16248); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2017-16248), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2017-16248), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2017-16248), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2017-16248), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-16248), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-16248), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-16248), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-16248)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-16248/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2017-16248)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2017-16248%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2017-16248%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2017-16248%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

0.20    2007-09-24 10:00:00
        - Fixed issue where the static dir regex did not add a trailing
          slash so URLs such as /static1 were served as static when they
          should be handled by Catalyst. (Will Hawes)

          to be served as static even if the file matches ignore_dirs or
          ignore_extensions.
        - Fixed bug where 204 or 304 status codes would result in a 500 error
          under mod_perl.
        - Switch to Module::Install.

0.15    2006-12-08 22:30:00
        - Quote metacharacters used in $c->config->{dirs} (Vlad Dan Dascalescu)
        - store Mime::Types object in config hash instead of as classdata
        - cleanup code a bit

0.14    2006-03-24 11:15:00
        - Unescape the URI path before looking for the file.  This fixes
          issues with files that have spaces.

0.13    2005-12-15 10:00:00
        - Fixed bug in ignore_dirs under win32.
        - Doc rewriting

0.12    (released only with Catalyst)
        - Made prepare_action play nice with other plugins by not short-
          circuiting.
        - Added tmpl to the ignored extensions.
        - Fixed security problem if req->path contained '..'.

0.11    2005-11-13 16:25:00
        - Removed the code that set the 304 Not Modified header.  This caused
          problems with IE under Apache.
        - Changed 5.50 writing method to pass an IO::File object directly to
          $c->res->body.
        - This version is included with Catalyst 5.50.

0.10    2005-10-19 17:20:00
        - Added tt2 to the list of ignored extensions.
        - For Catalyst 5.5+, replaced File::Slurp with a buffered read/write
          process.  This will improve memory usage and performance on larger
          static files.
        - Removed Apache integration feature.  It is slower than serving
          through Catalyst and as far as I know no one is using it.  If you
          need the best performance, use a separate Location block for static
          content.

0.09    2005-10-07 13:40:00
        - Added new configuration options to improve security:
          ignore_extensions - keep certain extensions from being static
          - This option defaults to tt, html, and xhtml to prevent
            template files from being accessible.
          ignore_dirs - keep certain dirs from being static
        - include_path is no longer experimental.
        - Added support for hiding log output, depends on Cat 5.50.
          (Marcus Ramberg)

0.08    2005-09-07 18:50:00
        - Added tests for everything except Apache support.

0.07    2005-09-05 21:05:00
        - POD fixes. (Thomas L. Shinnick)

0.06    2005-09-05 15:40:00
        - Moved initial file check into prepare_action so processing can
          bypass other plugins.
        - Added error-checking to static dir regexes.
        - Cleaned up various code as per Best Practices.

0.05    2005-08-26 12:00:00
        - Added use_apache option to enable the Apache DECLINED
          support.  Default is disabled as it appears Catalyst is
          faster at serving the files!
        - Added a check that Apache's DocumentRoot matches Catalyst's
          root before serving DECLINED.
        - Preload MIME::Types index during setup() so it's not built on
          the first request.
        - Added a note on performance of Apache vs. Catalyst.

0.04    2005-08-22 12:00:00
        - Fixed bug where static files were searched for on every request
          even without a file extension.
        - Fixed bug where files without extensions in defined static dirs
          were not served with text/plain.
        - Consolidated the debug log messages.

0.03    2005-08-21 23:50:00
        - Added config option for include_path to allow for multiple
          directories with static files.  This option should be
          considered experimental!
        - Documentation cleanups.

0.02    2005-08-16 18:00:00
        - Return DECLINED when running under mod_perl to allow Apache to
          serve the static file.  This is not done when any custom MIME
          types have been specified, however.

0.01    2005-08-11 22:00:00
        - Initial release.

```
Package: libcatalyst-plugin-static-simple-perl
Version: 0.31
Severity: important
Tags: security upstream fixed-upstream
Forwarded: <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=120558>

From upstream changelog for version 0.34:

    Fix security vulnerability, when serving static files with dots in
    the names (RT#120558)

Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple is a plugin for Catalyst, a web
framework in Perl. Its purpose is to serve static files, and it is
supposed to only serve files with extensions (from which it determines
the content type).

Due to the bug, however, any file under a directory whose name contains a
dot could be served.

the upstream fix is as follows:

--- a/lib/Catalyst/Plugin/Static/Simple.pm
+++ b/lib/Catalyst/Plugin/Static/Simple.pm
@@ -64,7 +64,7 @@ before prepare_action => sub {
     }

     # Does the path have an extension?
-    if ( $path =~ /.*\.(\S{1,})$/xms ) {
+    if ( $path =~ /\.([^\/\\]+)$/m ) {
         # and does it exist?
         $c->_locate_static_file( $path );
     }

That is, instead of matching one or more non-space characters between a
dot (including "/") and the end of the path, match one or more characters
different from "/" and "\" between a dot and the end of the path.

Cheers,
    dam
