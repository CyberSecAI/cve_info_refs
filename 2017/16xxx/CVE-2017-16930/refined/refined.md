{
  "CVE-2017-16930": {
    "root_cause": "The Claymore Dual ETH miner's remote management interface uses `sprintf` to write log messages to a fixed-size buffer (16384 bytes). An overly long API request to the management interface, specifically an unknown command, causes a stack buffer overflow when logging this to file or console.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
     "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the miner; Remote Code Execution (RCE) potentially leading to takeover of the mining node or host system.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Sending an overly long, unauthenticated API request to the remote management interface."
     ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system. The remote management interface must be enabled on the target."
   }
