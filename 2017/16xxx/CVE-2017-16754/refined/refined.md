The provided content relates to CVE-2017-16754.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Symfony profiler routes were accessible even when debugging was not enabled, or when the user was logged off and debugging was not configured to show when logged off. This allowed unauthorized access to potentially sensitive debugging information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure access control to the Symfony profiler routes.
- Lack of proper checks for debugging mode and user authentication before allowing access to profiler routes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the Symfony profiler, potentially exposing sensitive debugging information such as application configuration, database queries, and other internal data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to the profiler routes via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or logged in.
