{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The regular expression `/^(`+)\\s*([\\s\\S]*?[^`])\\s*\\1(?!`)/` used in parsing markdown input is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The regex is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking due to the nested quantifiers `(`+`)` and `([\\s\\S]*?)` . Specifically, the `([\\s\\S]*?[^`])` part combined with the backreference `\\1` and the negative lookahead `(?!`)` makes it susceptible to exponential backtracking.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A specially crafted input can cause the regex engine to take an extremely long time to process, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The example given states that for 1000 characters, the matching time was around 6 seconds, which suggests a serious slowdown.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted markdown input that triggers the catastrophic backtracking within the vulnerable regular expression.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to supply markdown input that is processed by the vulnerable regex."
