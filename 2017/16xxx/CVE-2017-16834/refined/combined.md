# PNP4Nagios: Root privilege escalation — GLSA **201806-09**

A vulnerability in PNP4Nagios which may allow local attackers to
gain root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/pnp4nagios** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.6.26-r9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.6.26-r9** |

### Background

 ">=net-analyzer/pnp4nagios-0.6.26-r9"

```

The dependency error is due to  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/net-analyzer/pnp4nagios?id=8a6c86311831919c79c94f0b4744e05691fe5045>  where I fixed the "nagios or icinga" dependency. Now it's possible for the user to wind up in a situation where either-icinga-or-icinga2 is pulled in via USE=icinga. As a result, we need either icinga or icinga2 stable on all arches where pnp4nagios is slated to be stabilized.  One solution would be to stabilize icinga2-2.7.1-r1 on ppc and ppc64 as a prerequisite for this.  @prometheanfire please let us know what you prefer. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2017-11-21 22:45:16 UTC  ``` I'd prefer stabilizing icinga2 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-11-21 22:49:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire ) from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=637640#c5)) > I'd prefer stabilizing icinga2  Any particular version?
