### @tj **[tj](/tj)** commented [Sep 1, 2011](#issue-1545677)

it's pretty trivial to trigger a `next(err)` for almost any middleware, by-design they should be handled in some unified fashion, however the one in this lib just throws. You could also emit an error event with the req/res to conditionally allow users to customize the handling if necessary

Sorry, something went wrong.

| one concern i have is that this 500 is indistinguishable from a 500 returned by the applications behind the proxy.  we could add a header 'x-node-proxy-error', or change the status code to one that is proxy specific, the problem is that there isn't one that fits perfectly.  ``` 10.5.3 502 Bad Gateway  The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response  from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.  10.5.5 504 Gateway Timeout  The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a  timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI  (e.g. HTTP, FTP, LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS)  it needed to access in attempting to complete the request.  ``` |
