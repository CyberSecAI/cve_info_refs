  "description": "NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager _3d.add_005f3d_005fview_005fdo_jsp Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability",
  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute code by creating arbitrary files on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp._3d.add_005f3d_005fview_005fdo_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the filename parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of Administrator.",
  "root_cause": "Improper validation of user-supplied path in the filename parameter before using it in file operations.",
  "weakness": "Directory Traversal",
  "impact": "Remote Code Execution",
  "attack_vector": "By manipulating the filename parameter, an attacker can write arbitrary files to the system, leading to code execution.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and leverage the directory traversal vulnerability to execute code with Administrator privileges.",
  "affected_products": "NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager",
  "fixed_versions": "v7.2.766 and above"
