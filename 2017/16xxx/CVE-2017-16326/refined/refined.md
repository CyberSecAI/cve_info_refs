This document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017-16326.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `strcpy` with an unconstrained source within the function that parses messages received from PubNub on channel “cc”. This function parses JSON messages, and the `strcpy` function copies values from the parsed JSON to a fixed size buffer, leading to a buffer overflow if the input value is larger than the destination buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The `strcpy` function is used to copy data into fixed-size stack buffers without checking the size of the source data. This allows an attacker to overwrite the stack by providing overly long input, leading to code execution. There are 86 different instances of this vulnerability in the Insteon Hub firmware.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary data on the stack, including return addresses, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the device. This can lead to complete compromise of the Insteon Hub.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending specially crafted JSON messages to the Insteon Hub via the PubNub service. The messages are sent through an authenticated HTTP request to the PubNub API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send authenticated HTTP requests to the PubNub service associated with the target Insteon Hub. This requires knowledge of the Insteon Hub ID and a valid authentication key, which is derived from the MAC address of the device. The attacker needs to send a specially crafted JSON payload via the "cc" channel.

**Specific details related to CVE-2017-16326:**
CVE-2017-16326 is one of 86 related vulnerabilities. Specifically, it is a stack buffer overflow that occurs when handling the `sn_sonos_cmd` key in a JSON message within the `s_sonos` command.

```json
{"cmd": "s_sonos", "sn_sonos_cmd": "OVERFLOW"}
```
The `strcpy` call for this specific case happens at address 0x9d01e5f4 and copies the value of the `sn_sonos_cmd` key to a buffer located at `$sp+0x2b0`, which has a size of 32 bytes.
