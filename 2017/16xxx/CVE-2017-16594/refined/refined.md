{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing the 'id' parameter in the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.db.save_005fimage_jsp servlet.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Authentication bypass"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can create arbitrary files on the vulnerable system and execute code under the context of the Administrator.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is located in the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.db.save_005fimage_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a malicious request to this servlet.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. This means that an attacker does not need to have valid credentials. The attacker needs to be able to send requests to port 8081 of the vulnerable system."
