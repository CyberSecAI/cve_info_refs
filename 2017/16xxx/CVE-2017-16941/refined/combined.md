## Description

[![@d4wner](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5992792?v=4&size=48)](/d4wner)[d4wner](https://github.com/d4wner)opened [on Nov 22, 2017](https://github.com/octobercms/october/issues/3257#issue-276042195)
##### Expected behavior

Well, dear sir, I just found an arbitrary upload vulnerability in Octobercms of the latest version.

#### ADLab of Venustech

##### Reproduce steps

When you login into the backend, you can visit：

`http://localhost/backend/cms/themes`

You can get the demo zip by export from demo theme, and now you have a zip file of demo.

Then you can add two file into the zip file，one evil php file and one .htaccess file.

**.htaccess**

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

    ##
    ## Standard routes
    ##
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ evil.php [L]

</IfModule>

```

**evil.php**

```
<?php
phpinfo();
?>

```

Now, I should upload the modified zip file , and import to cover the original demo theme folder.

When I upload successful, I'll get an evil file here .

Because of the new .htaccess file, I can visit the evil.php file directly now, I can see the php infomation of the server.

`http://localhost/themes/demo/assets/evil.php`

##### October build

The latest version.

Wish your response ,sir!
