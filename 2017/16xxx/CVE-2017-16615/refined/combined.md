# CVE-2017-16615: Critical RESTful Web Applications Vulnerability

**Python Package:**　　[MLAlchemy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mlalchemy/)

 **Version:**　　　　　 Before 0.2.2

 **Published:**　　　　Nov. 7th. 2017

 **Reported by:** 　　　　　 Joel

 **CVE-2017-16615** 　　　[CVE\_details](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16615)

## Overview

`MLAlchemy` is a Python-based utility library aimed at allowing relatively safe conversion from YAML/JSON to SQLAlchemy read-only queries. One use case here is to allow RESTful web applications (written in Python) to receive YAML- or JSON-based queries for data, e.g. from a front-end JavaScript-based application. By exploiting vulnerability, attackers can execute arbitrary python commands resulting in command execution. Due to a wide range of involved, the vulnerability is extremely dangerous.

An issue was discovered in the `MLAlchemy` package before `0.2.2`.Untrusted data passed into the `parse_yaml_query()` function can execute arbitrary python commands resulting in command execution.

## POC

| ``` 1 2  ``` | ``` from mlalchemy import parse_yaml_query parse_yaml_query('!!python/object/apply:os.system ["calc.exe"]')  ``` |
| --- | --- |

##### Poc Video

## Remediation

The updated versions of `MLAlchemy (0.2.2)` correctly use the `yaml.safe_load` method which prevents remote code execution.
