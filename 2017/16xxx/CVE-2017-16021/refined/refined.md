- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `uri-js` library's `parse` function uses a generated regular expression to parse URLs. This regex is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking when processing long URLs with specific patterns of encoded characters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) due to the catastrophic backtracking in the regex used by the `parse` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability causes the `parse` function to hang indefinitely, consuming 100% CPU and effectively preventing the application using this function from processing further requests, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a specially crafted long URL to the application that uses the vulnerable `uri-js` library. The crafted URL should contain a repeated pattern of encoded characters (e.g., `%c0%ae`) followed by some path information that triggers catastrophic backtracking in the regex.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application using the vulnerable library, particularly requests that allow for the construction of the malicious URL.

The provided content provides more specific technical details than a typical CVE description, showing the exponential time increase of the `parse` function with a crafted URL, the specific regex causing the issue and the sample code to reproduce the issue.
