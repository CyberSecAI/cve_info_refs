  "cveId": "CVE-2017-16638",
  "description": "The Gentoo net-misc/vde package before version 2.3.2-r4 may allow members of the \"qemu\" group to gain root privileges by creating a hard link in a directory on which \"chown\" is called recursively by the OpenRC service script.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The init script for VDE (Virtual Distributed Ethernet) contains an unsafe 'chown' command. The script changes the ownership of the `/var/run/vde.ctl` directory using `chown -R ${VDE_SOCK_CHOWN} /var/run/vde.ctl` where `VDE_SOCK_CHOWN` is set to `:qemu`. While the first execution of the command is probably safe, subsequent executions can be exploited.",
    "weakness": "The vulnerability arises because the `chown` command is executed on a directory controlled by the `qemu` group. A member of the `qemu` group can create a hard link from `/var/run/vde.ctl` to a root-owned file (e.g., `/run/ntpd.sock`). When the init script calls `chown` on `/var/run/vde.ctl`, it will recursively change the ownership of the target of the hard link (i.e., `/run/ntpd.sock`), effectively granting the `qemu` group access to that root-owned file.",
    "impact": "A local attacker who is a member of the 'qemu' group can escalate their privileges to root.",
    "attackVector": "A local attacker who is a member of the `qemu` group can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker must be a local user and a member of the `qemu` group. They must also be able to create hard links.",
    "affectedPackage": "net-misc/vde versions prior to 2.3.2-r4",
    "fixedVersion": "2.3.2-r4"
