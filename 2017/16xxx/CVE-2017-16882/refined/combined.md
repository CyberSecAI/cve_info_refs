# Icinga: Root privilege escalation — GLSA **202007-31**

Icinga installs files with insecure permissions allowing root
privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/icinga** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.14.2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

Icinga is an open source computer system and network monitoring
application. It was originally created as a fork of the Nagios system
monitoring application in 2009.

### Description

It was discovered that Icinga’s installed files have insecure
permissions, possibly allowing root privilege escalation.

### Impact

A local attacker could escalate privileges to root.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo has discontinued support for Icinga. We recommend that users
unmerge Icinga:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "net-analyzer/icinga"

```

NOTE: The Gentoo developer(s) maintaining Icinga have discontinued
support at this time. It may be possible that a new Gentoo developer will
update Icinga at a later date. The natural replacement is Icinga 2
(net-analyzer/icinga2).

## Description

[![@orlitzky](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1432135?v=4&size=48)](/orlitzky)[orlitzky](https://github.com/orlitzky)opened [on Nov 18, 2017](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-core/issues/1601#issue-275039246)

Hello,

Unfortunately icinga-core has the same problem with its installed permissions that nagios-core has, reported in [NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore#424](https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/424). The following executables are installed owned by the *icinga* user:

* `bin/icinga`
* `bin/icingastats`
* `bin/ido2db`
* `bin/log2ido`

and likewise with the config files -- at least the following are vulnerable:

* `etc/icinga.cfg`
* `etc/ido2db.cfg-sample` (yeah, it's a sample, but better safe than sorry)

The executables are exploitable because *icinga* can edit them and *root* will run them; the configs are vulnerable because *icinga* can edit them to give the daemons instructions and then insist that those daemons run as *root*.

The good news for you, potentially, is that maybe you don't care about maintaining compatibility with Nagios XI, and can set `icinga.cfg` to `root:root`.

My personal instinct would be to drop the `INSTALL_OPTS` all around, and then give the icinga user write permission only on those directories it needs. If somebody wants to manage the configs **other than icinga.cfg** with a dedicated, non-*icinga* group -- then he could do that either on his own or potentially with a new `--with-config-group` flag.

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-11-19 21:52:09 UTC  ``` Finally your icinga-1.x counterpart to [bug 629380](show_bug.cgi?id=629380 "RESOLVED FIXED - <net-analyzer/nagios-core-4.3.4: root privilege escalation through insecure permissions (CVE-2017-14312)"). The problem here is the same as it was with nagios, except you have a few more affected files thanks to ido2db. From the summary,    Icinga installs two sets of files with insecure permissions: after    installation, the executables and the configuration files are all   owned by the same unprivileged user and group (typically, icinga)   that the daemon runs as. In one attack, the unprivileged user simply   replaces the icinga executable with one that does his bidding. A   slightly more complicated attack can be mounted by the unprivileged   user by scheduling a malicious service check and then altering icinga.cfg   to execute that check as root.    The ido2db daemon and its sample configuration file have the same issue.   And the tl;dr is to install everything as root:root unless icinga needs to write to it at runtime (not a lot of places). You can see how I fixed this for nagios-core by diffing nagios-core-4.3.3.ebuild against nagios-core-4.3.4.ebuild, but the new src_install in v4.3.4 is pretty easy to read, and you might be better off doing src_install from scratch.  As with nagios-core, we'll have to tell users how to secure their existing installations, because portage won't overwrite the existing owner/group. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2017-11-22 02:22:06 UTC  ``` at least with icinga the src-install install's unstripped by default, but working on it now ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2017-11-22 02:54:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 505596](attachment.cgi?id=505596 "proposed patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=505596&action=edit "proposed patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=505596&action=diff "proposed patch")] proposed patch  I don't run icinga anymore (moved entirely to icinga2), not sure who to get to test this as this point, but everything is moved to root:root like nagios. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2017-12-03 03:35:02 UTC  ``` OK, committed it as a revbump to 1.14.0, but as this isn't the best tested I'll wait a month before asking for stable. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robin Johnson   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2017-12-03 15:38:46 UTC  ``` prometheanfire: Here's an issue I see: fowners icinga:icinga /etc/icinga/eventhandlers Is later overwritten by fowners -R root:root /etc/icinga/   If eventhandlers doesn't need icinga:icinga, just kill that first line? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2017-12-03 17:55:20 UTC  ``` Doesn't seem like a hard issue, but it should be simplified, I'll comment it out for now though. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-12-05 01:29:52 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 629282](show_bug.cgi?id=629282 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - net-analyzer/icinga: root privilege escalation via init script") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-12-26 23:56:20 UTC  ``` Most of the permissions/ownership should be fixed in the latest v1.14.2, so that you no longer need to run fperms/fowners a million times. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Matthew Thode ( prometheanfire )   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2017-12-30 17:38:33 UTC  ``` 1.14.2 is stable and the old bad versions are removed.  cleaned up, removing me from cc ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  D'juan McDonald (domhnall)    2019-07-17 02:46:39 UTC  ``` Clean up done... @security please proceed.
