{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `dvb_frontend_free` function in `drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c` in the Linux kernel allowed a use-after-free vulnerability. This function was later renamed `__dvb_frontend_free`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impacts. Specifically, a malicious user can write to memory that may be assigned to another kernel structure. This could lead to memory corruption or a panic.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted USB device can trigger the vulnerability during device disconnection.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user and able to interact with USB devices."
  },
  "affected_products": [
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel-alt package."
   ],
 "fixes": [
    "The issue was fixed in kernel version 4.14.  The fix involves not clearing fe->frontend_priv in the `__dvb_frontend_free` function."
  ]
