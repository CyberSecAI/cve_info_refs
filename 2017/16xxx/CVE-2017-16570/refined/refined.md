Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16570:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in KeystoneJS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF Bypass:** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests and execute them on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge or consent.
*   This could include creating new users with attacker-controlled credentials, changing user details like name, email, and passwords, or submitting forms on the user's behalf, potentially leading to unauthorized account access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTML form that is sent to a logged-in user. When the user opens the form, it automatically submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint of the KeystoneJS application without the user's knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send an HTML form to a victim that is currently logged into a vulnerable KeystoneJS application.
*   The attacker doesn't need to know the victim's credentials, as the attack leverages the victim's active session.
*   The attacker must be able to get the victim to open the malicious HTML form in a browser where they have an active session with the vulnerable application.

**Additional notes:**
* The provided exploit code shows how an attacker can create a new user by sending a form with specified data to the `/keystone/api/users/create` endpoint.
* The blog post from SecureLayer7 confirms that a CSRF bypass was found during their penetration test of KeystoneJS.
* The provided github content is unrelated to this CVE.
