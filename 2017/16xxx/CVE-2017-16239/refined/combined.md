# RHSA-2018:0314 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0314)

## Topic

An update for openstack-nova is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and controlling access through users and projects.

Security Fix(es):

* By rebuilding an instance using a new image, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent the Filter Scheduler, bypassing imposed filters (for example, the ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter). (CVE-2017-16239)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges George Shuklin (Servers.com) as the original reporter.

Bug Fix(es):

* A recent update caused OpenStack Compute to ignore the disk cache mode configuration. This caused I/O performance degradation in instances. This fix corrects how OpenStack Compute configures disk caching. Instances no longer suffer performance degradation. (BZ#1508647)

## Solution

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RHSA-2018:0241 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0241)

## Topic

An update for openstack-nova is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0 (Pike).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and controlling access through users and projects.

Security Fix(es):

* By rebuilding an instance using a new image, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent the Filter Scheduler, bypassing imposed filters (for example, the ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter). (CVE-2017-16239)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges George Shuklin (Servers.com) as the original reporter.

## Solution

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

### Bug Description

Big picture: If some image has some restriction on aggregates or hosts it can be run on, tenant may use nova rebuild command to circumvent those restrictions. Main issue is with ImagePropertiesFilter, but it may cause issues with combination of flavor/image (for example allows to run license restricted OS (Windows) on host which has no such license, or rebuild instance with cheap flavor with image which is restricted only for high-priced flavors).

I don't know if this is a security bug or not, if you would find it non-security issue, please remove the security flag.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Set up nova with ImagePropertiesFilter or IsolatedHostsFilter active. They should allows to run 'image1' only on 'host1', but never on 'host2'.

2. Boot instance with some other (non-restricted) image on 'host2'.

3. Use nova rebuild INSTANCE image1

Expected result:

nova rejects rebuild because given image ('image1') may not run on 'host2'.

Actual result:

nova happily rebuild instance with image1 on host2, violating restrictions.

Checked affected version: mitaka.

I believe, due to the way 'rebuild' command is working, newton and master are affected too.

I believe the issue is that we bypass the scheduler filters because in the compute API for rebuild we pass the existing host for the instance to conductor here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/93bf6ba5186a3663606aa843a2f247709173f073/nova/compute/api.py#L3015>

And then in the conductor manager rebuild\_instance method, this "if not host" line is False because the compute API provided the host (the current host the instance is running on):

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/93bf6ba5186a3663606aa843a2f247709173f073/nova/conductor/manager.py#L698>

And then we happily cast to nova-compute to rebuild the instance with the new image, bypassing the filter checks:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/93bf6ba5186a3663606aa843a2f247709173f073/nova/conductor/manager.py#L757>

If the compute API didn't provide the host (like in the case of evacuate), then we'd go through the scheduler to pick a host based on the filters:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/93bf6ba5186a3663606aa843a2f247709173f073/nova/conductor/manager.py#L722>

In the case of evacuate, this is where we make sure to pass host=None to conductor's rebuild\_instance method so that we go through the scheduler:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/93bf6ba5186a3663606aa843a2f247709173f073/nova/compute/api.py#L3978>

I'm not sure if this is a security vulnerability per se, but it's definitely a bug. Sylvain Bauza is probably someone that should look at this.

I may be naive here, but the fix seems rather trivial. In rebuild\_instance in conductor manager, in the rebuild case (where host is not None), we could call \_schedule\_instances and assert that the provided host must be in the returned list, else we can't rebuild the instance on that host with that image.

Yeah, the bug is latent since <https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/d6ca1cc02ab58615a6bb1b337db34dd06525112e>

Basically, we accepted to not verify the scheduler in case of a rebuild because it was staying with the compute node. What we missed is that in case people pass a different image, then it could be something not acceptable for the scheduler.

Is that a security issue ? Probably. Should it be embargoed ? Not sure, but I leave other commenting that.

About the possible solution, I think we could easily mimic the evacuate behaviour and use the RequestSpec.requested\_destination field for calling the scheduler but only for that specific host.

See <https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/93bf6ba5186a3663606aa843a2f247709173f073/nova/compute/api.py#L3977-L3994> where we set that field if the operator doesn't want to force the target.

About severity of the issue: I've just imaged scenario where this would lead to compromise.

Let's says we got some PCI-passthrough installation which relies on image-level (operating system level) permissions to allow or disallow some operations with hardware. Tenants are allowed to use images with properly configured permissions system and they are forbidden to run random (untrusted/unverified) code on those nodes.

By issuing 'rebuild' command with specially crafted image malicious tenant may compromise hardware by means of bypassing image-level security and Openstack's restriction on which images are allowed to run on the node with sensitive hardware.

I don't think that this is a common use case, but who knows whom Stuxnet would use this bug on whom nuclear factory.

One more thing I thought about: What should nova do during 'nova rebuild' command if this host's nova-compute is marked as 'disabled' by system administrator?

Should it allows to rebuild or should it rejects?

George, that's something optionable by operators : if they disabled ComputeFilter in their nova.conf, then the scheduler stops only accepting active computes, and can return disabled nodes too.

Nothing on a case-by-case tho, that would require an admin-only API modification hence a blueprint to address that.

This looks like a class A type of bug according to VMT's taxonomy ( <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy> ), though I'm in favor for fixing this in the open since the impact sounds limited.

Impact description draft:

Title: Nova Filter Scheduler bypass through rebuild action

Reporter: George Shuklin (servers.com)

Products: Nova

Affects: >=13.0.0 <=13.1.3, >=14.0.0 <=14.0.4, ==15.0.0

Description:

George Shuklin from servers.com reported a vulnerability in Nova.

By rebuilding a malicious instance, an authenticated user may be able to bypass

Filter Scheduler resulting in restrictions violation such as the

ImagePropertiesFilter and the IsolatedHostsFilter. All setups using Nova

Filter Scheduler are affected.

I agree that if these controls are relied on by some deployments as a security measure, then bypass by users does constitute a vulnerability.

In light of the Nova stable/ocata point release which was tagged a few hours after your impact description draft, the affects line should now be...

Affects: >=13.0.0 <=13.1.3, >=14.0.0 <=14.0.4, >=15.0.0 <=15.0.1

The middle sentence of the description is also a little hard for me to follow. How about...

I'm still on the fence to keep this under embargo if the filter scheduler aren't a common use-case, should we subscribe ossg-coresec to weigh on this (as explained here: <https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#embargo-exceptions> ) ?

Otherwise we need coresec review on the proposed patch in comment #7 and backport to mitaka, newton and ocata, in particular since the patch doesn't apply cleanly on mitaka.

George: I'm in full agreement with you there. I've been suggesting for a while that the OpenStack VMT should set a hard limit on the acceptable duration of report embargoes and switch bugs to public security type for wider assistance if not resolved in that timeframe. There has been pushback on that philosophy in the past, but it's certainly worth bringing up again.

I've also subscribed the security team's advisory group to give them a heads up that there is interest in switching this report to our public security workflow, and get their input.

@Sylvain, your patch won't work because of this in the conductor rebuild\_instance method:

That's going to modify the request\_spec to tell the scheduler to ignore the instance.host, which is exactly where we want to go if we're doing a rebuild (not evacuate).

Here is the patch with the recreate test and fix.

There are some TODOs in here so this is for initial review by nova core-sec.

Also note that the test changes could be a bit simpler if I changed some of the fixture usage and ran it as an admin client - that might be desirable for making the fix more self-contained for backports.

Alright, some of the USE\_NEUTRON stuff that I changed in the original master branch patch had a side effect on some other tests, so I'm just going to have to remove that stuff, and thus redo the patches on stable once that's done. So hold off on sending these patches to people. I'll work on it over the weekend and post them all in a single comment when I'm done and sure they are all passing all unit and functional tests.

Backports look good to me. I'm happy to hold the nova EOL until after this has been merged. I do worry that a late change like this could be a little disruptive so I wonder if it's worth releasing nova (newton) as is and then again after this has merged that way if we've made a mistake there is a pretty easy work around.

Of course having said that newton \*is\* EOL so I'd hope that operators are just fast-forwarding through it rather than spending any real time running it. :D

Here's an updated impact description to cover latest releases and EOLs in the time since comment #13 (the lowest affected release may need altering if we follow Tony's recommendation to have a 14.0.9 without the fix and then tag 14.0.10 with it):

---

Title: Nova Filter Scheduler bypass through rebuild action

Reporter: George Shuklin (servers.com)

Products: Nova

Affects: <=14.0.8, >=15.0.0 <=15.0.7, >=16.0.0 <=16.0.2

George Shuklin from servers.com reported a vulnerability in Nova. By rebuilding an instance, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent the Filter Scheduler bypassing imposed filters (for example, the ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter). All setups using Nova Filter Scheduler are affected.

---

If I send a pre-OSSA to our downstream stakeholders today we \*could\* schedule the public advisory for this Thursday (November 2), but I'm concerned that we have limited VMT coverage to handle publication that day due to some of us traveling to Sydney for the OpenStack Summit and have further concerns that the Nova team may have trouble finding someone to shepherd the patches through Gerrit in a timely fashion as well as stable release management to approve subsequent point release requests. And then there's the problem that many of the staff from organizations impacted by this could fail to notice the advisory on Thursday for the same reasons.

At this point I'm leaning toward notifying downstreams via pre-OSSA this week but scheduling publication for Tuesday November 14 (first non-Monday business day after the Summit week) when more people will be around to help and to notice the advisory. I need to know, however, how much of a pain it is to delay Newton EOL for two weeks without being able to publicly say why.

An alternative is to declare that the criticality/impact of this bug is minimal enough to switch to our public disclosure workflow today so we can send an advisory earlier this week... opinions?

Keeping stable/newton around a couple of weeks for nova isn't a problem for the nova team, but I can't speak for infra and/or Tony for stable maintenance. I think we have people around in nova that can shepherd fixes through the stable branches this week, but again can't speak for getting the stable branch point releases done this week while people are traveling.

I like the delay (pre-ossa this week) but the delayed push until post Sydney. I feel like it's best to let folks focus on the summit instead of pushing through an embargoed set of patches.

Given the feedback so far on the available options, in an effort to avoid surprising our community while it's in the midst of its busiest conference week of the season I'm inclined to send the pre-OSSA (impact description and patches) to the downstream stakeholders on our embargo notice list today indicating Tuesday November 14 as the planned public disclosure for this advisory. That's 10 business days instead of our usual 3-5, but if someone happens to leak it early this is at least a limited enough vulnerability that it won't be too terrible of an emergency.

I tested the patch in newton and it works well.

But when nova rejects the rebuild operation, image of the instance is still changed.

For example, if we rebuild an ubuntu instance with a new windows image and it is rejected by the nova scheduler, when we do a "nova show" we see that the instance has a windows image.

If an exception is raised here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/newton/nova/conductor/manager.py#L699>

it may be necessary to update the instance with the old image:

instance.task\_state = None

instance.image\_ref = orig\_image\_ref

instance.save()

@Nolwenn, thanks for testing the patch. The issue you described about the image\_ref is a long-standing issue in any case where rebuild fails once we RPC cast from the API to the conductor (or compute) service, and is related to [bug 1482040](/bugs/1482040). I think that is a separate, latent issue, worth fixing on it's own, not as part of this security fix.

Validate new image via scheduler during rebuild

During a rebuild we bypass the scheduler because we are

    always rebuilding the instance on the same host it's already

    on. However, we allow passing a new image during rebuild

    and that new image needs to be validated to work with the

    instance host by running it through the scheduler filters,

    like the ImagePropertiesFilter. Otherwise the new image

    could violate constraints placed on the host by the admin.

This change checks to see if there is a new image provided

    and if so, modifies the request spec passed to the scheduler

    so that the new image is validated all while restricting

    the scheduler to still pick the same host that the instance

    is running on. If the image is not valid for the host, the

    scheduler will raise NoValidHost and the rebuild stops.

A functional test is added to show the recreate of the bug

    and that we probably stop the rebuild now in conductor by

    calling the scheduler to validate the image.

    2. The \_wait\_for\_action\_fail\_completion method didn't exist

    3. The PlacementFixture wasn't used in \_IntegratedTestBase

       so it's done as part of the test setup.

    4. The default scheduler filters were different in Ocata so

       the test just restricts to using ImagePropertiesFilter.

    5. A few imports were needed in the test module.

commit 97a51d981bd603b964b04b3568218ce57ac57338

Author: Matt Riedemann <email address hidden>

Validate new image via scheduler during rebuild

During a rebuild we bypass the scheduler because we are

    always rebuilding the instance on the same host it's already

    on. However, we allow passing a new image during rebuild

    and that new image needs to be validated to work with the

    instance host by running it through the scheduler filters,

    like the ImagePropertiesFilter. Otherwise the new image

    could violate constraints placed on the host by the admin.

This change checks to see if there is a new image provided

    and if so, modifies the request spec passed to the scheduler

    so that the new image is validated all while restricting

    the scheduler to still pick the same host that the instance

    is running on. If the image is not valid for the host, the

    scheduler will raise NoValidHost and the rebuild stops.

A functional test is added to show the recreate of the bug

    and that we probably stop the rebuild now in conductor by

    calling the scheduler to validate the image.

Co-Authored-By: Sylvain Bauza <email address hidden>

Closes-Bug: #1664931

NOTE(mriedem): There were a few changes needed for Newton:

1. There is no PlacementFixture but it's not needed.

    2. The API client needs to have the microversion set from

       the test.

    3. The enabled\_filters config option wasn't in Newton.

    4. The scheduler has to be started before compute otherwise

       we get a MessagingTimeout due to the CastAsCall fixture

       during the compute startup.

Refined fix for validating image on rebuild

This aims to fix the issue described in [bug 1664931](/bugs/1664931) where a rebuild

    fails to validate the existing host with the scheduler when a new

    image is provided. The previous attempt to do this could cause rebuilds

    to fail unnecessarily because we ran \_all\_ of the filters during a

    rebuild, which could cause usage/resource filters to prevent an otherwise

    valid rebuild from succeeding.

This aims to classify filters as useful for rebuild or not, and only apply

    the former during a rebuild scheduler check. We do this by using an internal

    scheduler hint, indicating our intent. This should (a) filter out

    all hosts other than the one we're running on and (b) be detectable by

    the filtering infrastructure as an internally-generated scheduling request

    in order to trigger the correct filtering behavior.

Add regression test for rebuild with new image doubling allocations

Commit 984dd8ad6add4523d93c7ce5a666a32233e02e34 makes a rebuild

    with a new image go through the scheduler again to validate the

    image against the instance.host (we rebuild to the same host that

    the instance already lives on).

The problem is that change introduced a regression where the

    FilterScheduler is going to think it's doing a resize to the same

    host and double the allocations for the instance (and usage for the

    compute node provider) in Placement, which is wrong since the

    flavor is the same.

This adds a regression test to show the bug.

Refined fix for validating image on rebuild

This aims to fix the issue described in [bug 1664931](/bugs/1664931) where a rebuild

    fails to validate the existing host with the scheduler when a new

    image is provided. The previous attempt to do this could cause rebuilds

    to fail unnecessarily because we ran \_all\_ of the filters during a

    rebuild, which could cause usage/resource filters to prevent an otherwise

    valid rebuild from succeeding.

This aims to classify filters as useful for rebuild or not, and only apply

    the former during a rebuild scheduler check. We do this by using an internal

    scheduler hint, indicating our intent. This should (a) filter out

    all hosts other than the one we're running on and (b) be detectable by

    the filtering infrastructure as an internally-generated scheduling request

    in order to trigger the correct filtering behavior.

Conflicts:

          nova/scheduler/filters/exact\_core\_filter.py

          nova/scheduler/filters/exact\_disk\_filter.py

          nova/scheduler/filters/exact\_ram\_filter.py

          nova/scheduler/filters/type\_filter.py

NOTE(mriedem): The conflicts were due to deprecation warnings

    which don't exist in Ocata. The functional test also needed a missing

    import and to use api\_put() instead of put\_service().

Add regression test for rebuild with new image doubling allocations

Commit 984dd8ad6add4523d93c7ce5a666a32233e02e34 makes a rebuild

    with a new image go through the scheduler again to validate the

    image against the instance.host (we rebuild to the same host that

    the instance already lives on).

The problem is that change introduced a regression where the

    FilterScheduler is going to think it's doing a resize to the same

    host and double the allocations for the instance (and usage for the

    compute node provider) in Placement, which is wrong since the

    flavor is the same.

This adds a regression test to show the bug.

NOTE(mriedem): Due to cc833359870d3962326c35094adea2f525ec8141 not

    being in Pike, we have to use the MediumFakeDriver until the bug

    is fixed. Also, the ComputeManager.\_get\_nodename method doesn't exist

    in Pike so we have to just get the hypervisor uuid from the os-hypervisors

    API.

# OSSA-2017-005: Nova Filter Scheduler bypass through rebuild action

# OSSA-2017-005: Nova Filter Scheduler bypass through rebuild action[Â¶](#ossa-2017-005-nova-filter-scheduler-bypass-through-rebuild-action "Link to this heading")

Date:

November 14, 2017

CVE:

CVE-2017-16239

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Nova: <=14.0.10, >=15.0.0 <=15.0.8, >=16.0.0 <=16.0.3

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

George Shuklin from servers.com reported a vulnerability in Nova. By rebuilding an instance, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent the Filter Scheduler bypassing imposed filters (for example, the ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter). All setups using Nova Filter Scheduler are affected.

## Errata[Â¶](#errata "Link to this heading")

The former fix introduced regressions in the rebuild functionality. Rebuild may fail depending on configured scheduler filters and environment, for example, when the compute host is running at capacity or when the host is disabled. This update provides an additional set of fixes for these regressions.

## Patches[Â¶](#patches "Link to this heading")

Consequently, this caused the 'get\_available\_resources' method to report incorrect vCPUs used values for the Compute node. This meant it was overcounting resource consumption for plain QEMU guests, as they can only ever consume 1 pCPU of time, regardless of vCPU count. With this update, if a host does not report detailed vCPU usage from libvirt, then it should default to reporting 1 vCPU per guest, so that the 'vcpus\_used' field reports some reasonably meaningful data on host CPU usage. As a result, libvirt does not report that 'cpu affinity is not supported' when guests are running in TCG. | | | Clone Of: | [1420903](show_bug.cgi?id=1420903 "CLOSED ERRATA - Seeing cpu affinity is not supported messages on compute node") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-04-03 10:31:54 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

Package        : nova
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-16239
Debian Bug     : 882009

George Shuklin from servers.com discovered that Nova, a cloud
computing fabric controller, did not correctly enforce its image- or
hosts-filters. This allowed an authenticated user to bypass those
filters by simply rebuilding an instance.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:14.0.0-4+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nova packages.

For the detailed security status of nova please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nova>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

## Topic

An update for openstack-nova and python-novaclient is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and controlling access through users and projects.

python-novaclient is the python client for the OpenStack Nova API. The client's Python API (the novaclient module) and command-line script (nova) both implement 100% of the OpenStack Nova API.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-nova (14.1.0), python-novaclient (6.0.2). (BZ#1501736)

Security Fix(es):

* By rebuilding an instance using a new image, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent the Filter Scheduler, bypassing imposed filters (for example, the ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter). (CVE-2017-16239)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges George Shuklin (Servers.com) as the original reporter.

Bug Fix(es):

* Prior to this update, QEMU (also known as TCG) guests had an issue where the `guest.get\_vcpu\_info` method was throwing an exception indicating that 0 were vCPUs used on the host, regardless of how many guests were running. Consequently, this caused the 'get\_available\_resources' method to report incorrect vCPUs used values for the Compute node. This meant it was overcounting resource consumption for plain QEMU guests, as they can only ever consume 1 pCPU of time, regardless of vCPU count. With this update, if a host does not report detailed vCPU usage from libvirt, then it should default to reporting 1 vCPU per guest, so that the 'vcpus\_used' field reports some reasonably meaningful data on host CPU usage. As a result, libvirt does not report that 'cpu affinity is not supported' when guests are running in TCG. (BZ#1515165)
* With this enhancement, the act of evacuating instances with pinned CPUs can result in these instances being hosted on a hypervisor which already handles instances with the same pinning configuration. This was added because the resource tracker does not track CPU pinning for instances on hosts. As a result, a condition has been added to the NUMATopologyFilter filter, which passes on hosts which already manage an instance with same CPU pinning configuration as the instance being evacuated. (BZ#1517272)
* Previously, the `request\_spec.spec` column's TEXT type was too small, with the result that large request\_specs may not have fit successfully. Consequently, running the online data migration as part of an OSP9 to OSP10 upgrade could have resulted in failure if an instance created before the upgrade had a large request\_spec (for example, by having many members in its affinity/anti-affinity group). With this update, the request\_spec.spec column has been increased to `MEDIUMTEXT`. As a result, online data migration should no longer fail during a OSP9 to OSP10 upgrade. (BZ#1526082)
* Previously, when detaching a Ceph volume connected to guest as a PCI device, the volume was not detached and libvirt reported an invalid PCI address. This arose because the PCI address of the device was not properly formatted due to a missing method in the guest XML formatter. To address this issue, this update adds a proper `format\_dom` method for `LibvirtConfigGuestDeviceAddressPCI`. As a result, it is now possible to detach a Ceph volume. (BZ#1527345)
