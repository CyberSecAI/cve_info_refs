Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The SanDisk SecureAccess software creates plain-text temporary files on disk when opening encrypted files "in place". The software fails to properly delete these temporary files under certain conditions, leaving sensitive data exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The software decrypts files and writes them to the `%TEMP%` directory. This is a common practice, but the software lacks sufficient safeguards for deleting these files, especially if the user has the decrypted file open in another application.
2.  **Failure to Delete Temporary Files:**  The software attempts to delete the temporary files upon closing, but fails if the files are locked (e.g., still open in another application).  The application doesn't handle this situation gracefully, and doesn't provide the user with a warning that their files may not have been deleted.
3.  **Lack of Warning:** The software does not warn users about the potential for leaving plain-text copies of their files on disk if the delete operation fails, either due to open file locks or a crash.
4.  **Vulnerable to Crashes/Unexpected Termination:** If the application crashes, experiences a power failure, or if the user ends the process, the routine to delete the temporary files does not execute, leaving sensitive files in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by:

1.  **Accessing Undeleted Temporary Files:** An attacker with access to the user's system could find plain-text copies of encrypted files in the `%TEMP%` directory if the user exited the SanDisk SecureAccess application while the files were locked, or experienced a crash.
2.  **Persistent Data Exposure:** Because the `%TEMP%` directory is not automatically emptied by Windows, the plaintext files can persist on disk, increasing the window of opportunity for exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

1. **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to the user's computer to exploit this vulnerability.
2. **Timing/State Dependence:** The attacker would need to wait for a moment where the user has opened encrypted files in place using the application, and then either the user closes the software while files are locked, or if the software crashes or is terminated unexpectedly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Physical or remote access to the victim's machine.
*   Basic understanding of the Windows file system, specifically the `%TEMP%` directory, would be beneficial to an attacker.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vendor (SanDisk) initially denied this as a vulnerability, stating that the software's behavior was "as designed".
*   The software uses a third-party encryption library called EncryptStick.

This vulnerability is more serious than described by the vendor because it leaves unencrypted data on the hard drive and it fails silently, thus deceiving the user into thinking the sensitive data is secure.
