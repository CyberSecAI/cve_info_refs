Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16827:

**Verification:**

The Gentoo Security Advisory explicitly lists CVE-2017-16827 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in their fix for Binutils. The sourceware.org bug report (Bug 22306) directly relates to a heap corruption vulnerability in `slurp_symtab()`, which is associated with the binutils package.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an invalid `free()` call within the `slurp_symtab()` function of Binutils. This occurs because `aout_get_external_symbols` does not properly handle cases where the string size is zero or doesn't cover the header word.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Heap corruption: An invalid `free()` operation can corrupt the heap, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- Integer Handling: Improper size checking within the symbol table parsing logic leads to incorrect memory management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition when parsing a crafted file.
- Possible unspecified impacts: The Gentoo advisory mentions the potential for other unspecified impacts beyond DoS which is typical for heap corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Specially crafted ELF, object, PE, or binary files: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed file using tools like `objdump`.
- Enticing user: The attacker needs to entice the user to execute/compile a malicious file that exploits the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to create a malicious file: An attacker needs to construct a file with a specific structure that triggers the flawed memory handling.
- Remote Position: The attacker could be remote, as they need to convince the user to parse the malicious file.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**

The provided content offers greater detail compared to a typical CVE description. It pinpoints the vulnerable function (`slurp_symtab()` called through the `aout_get_external_symbols` function), describes the root cause (improper size checks), and demonstrates the exploit with a debugger output. The Gentoo advisory also indicates the affected package and affected/unaffected versions.  The sourceware bug report includes a proof-of-concept.
