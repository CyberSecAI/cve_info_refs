Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-16818:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a failed assertion in the `ceph_assert()` function within `rgw_iam_policy.cc`. This assertion can be triggered by user-supplied input processed during a REST call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Assertion failure:** The code uses assertions (which are typically meant for development-time checks) in a way that is reachable via user input, leading to a program crash upon failure.
- **Lack of input validation/sanitization:** The system does not properly validate or sanitize user input before it reaches the assertion in `rgw_iam_policy.cc`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most direct impact is a crash of the Ceph service processing the REST call, leading to a denial of service. This prevents legitimate users from accessing or using the impacted functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- **REST API:** The attack vector is through a REST call, which means a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to have access to the REST API and be able to send requests to the affected service.
- **Knowledge of required input:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge about the format of the input that triggers the assertion failure.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Ceph storage system.
- The fix involved removing the problematic assertions in the IAM Policy code.
- The issue was deemed not to affect Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3 and 2, because bucket policies were not supported in the Ceph versions shipped with those products.
- The issue affects Fedora distributions and EPEL 6.
- The vulnerability lies within the `rgw_iam_policy.cc` file, specifically during the parsing and processing of IAM policies.
- The patch modifies `rgw_basic_types.h`, `rgw_iam_policy.cc`, and `rgw_iam_policy.h`.
