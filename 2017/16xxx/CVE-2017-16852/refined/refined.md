Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A coding error exists within the "Dynamic" metadata plugin of the Shibboleth Service Provider. This error prevents the plugin from correctly configuring itself with the provided filters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The "Dynamic" plugin fails to apply MetadataFilter plugins, which are responsible for critical security checks.
- Consequently, security checks such as signature verification, enforcement of validity periods, and other deployment-specific checks are omitted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Deployments are left vulnerable to active attacks.
- Attackers can potentially substitute metadata if the network path to the query service is compromised.
- This could lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves compromising the network path to the metadata query service.
- Attackers substitute metadata, bypassing the intended security checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic between the Shibboleth Service Provider and the metadata query service.
- They need to be in a position to substitute malicious metadata for legitimate metadata.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Shibboleth Service Provider software prior to V2.6.1.
- An identical issue exists in the DynamicMetadataProvider class in the OpenSAML-C library in all versions prior to V2.6.1 (CVE-2017-16853).
- The vulnerability is considered a critical security issue.
- The advisory recommends disabling the use of the affected feature until the upgrade is done.
