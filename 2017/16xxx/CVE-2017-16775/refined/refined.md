- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames in `SSOOauth.cgi`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Clickjacking vulnerability due to improper rendering restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can conduct clickjacking attacks. The impact includes limited confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:L/I:L/A:L) according to the CVSS vector.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability via unspecified vectors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be remote (AV:N), have low attack complexity (AC:L), require no privileges (PR:N) and requires user interaction (UI:R).
