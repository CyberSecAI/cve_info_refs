The provided content relates to CVE-2017-16267.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `strcpy` to copy data from JSON message parameters into fixed-size stack buffers without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `strcpy` function copies the string from the JSON message directly into stack buffers. When the length of the copied data exceeds the buffer's size, it causes a buffer overflow. This allows overwriting of arbitrary data on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious JSON payload and sending it through the PubNub service. The overflow allows overwriting of return addresses and other sensitive data on the stack, leading to control over the device's execution flow.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Insteon Hub via PubNub's publish API. The request must contain a JSON payload with a command that uses the vulnerable `strcpy` function and a parameter value that exceeds the corresponding buffer's size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send authenticated HTTP requests to the PubNub service used by the Insteon Hub. This implies that the attacker should have knowledge of the PubNub publish key, subscribe key, and the authentication key associated with the Insteon Hub.
Specifically the attacker would need to know the device's MAC address.
