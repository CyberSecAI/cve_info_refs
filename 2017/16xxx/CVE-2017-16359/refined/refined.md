The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16359.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow when processing the `vd_aux` field in ELF files' version information. Specifically, the code attempts to read data based on the offset indicated by `vd_aux` without properly checking if the resulting address is within the valid bounds of the ELF file, leading to an out-of-bounds read when parsing ELF files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds read
- Improper bounds checking

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash due to segmentation fault
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the out-of-bounds read is further exploited

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted ELF file with a malicious `vd_aux` value in the version information section

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted ELF file to radare2.
- No special privileges needed
