{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `res_pjsip_session` module in Asterisk leaks RTP instances when a call is rejected with a 488 response after RTP instances are created.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource leak",
      "Improper cleanup of RTP instances"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious SIP client can repeatedly send requests that result in 488 responses. This will cause a resource exhaustion by leaking RTP ports, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send SIP requests to the vulnerable Asterisk instance.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send SIP requests to the Asterisk server. If authentication is enabled, the attacker needs valid SIP credentials. However, this can be exploited if authentication is disabled."
