- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Insteon Hub's firmware uses the `strcpy` function to copy data from a JSON message received via PubNub into fixed-size stack buffers without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflows due to the use of `strcpy` with unconstrained input from JSON parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary data on the stack, including return addresses, which allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted JSON messages via the PubNub service to the "cc" channel of the Insteon Hub. The messages are sent using an HTTP GET request that includes the crafted JSON in the URL path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send authenticated HTTP requests to the PubNub service.
    - The attacker requires the Insteon Hub's PubNub publish and subscribe keys, as well as the device's ID and authentication key. These can be extracted from the mobile application or through network analysis.
    - The attacker must know the specific channel (e.g. "<insteon-id>-cc") to target for the device.
