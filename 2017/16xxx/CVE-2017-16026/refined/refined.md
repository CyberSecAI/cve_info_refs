{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "When the `body` option in a multipart request is a `Number`, the `request` library uses this number as the size argument to create a Buffer which results in a buffer with uninitialized memory, which will then be sent in the body of the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of uninitialized memory",
      "Improper handling of data types"
    ],
    "impact": "Disclosure of uninitialized memory from the server's memory. This could contain sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a multipart request with the body option set to a number.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request using the `request` library. This is typically a software vulnerability and not a network-based attack."
  },
    "additional_details": {
    "vulnerable_versions": "Versions <2.68.0 and >2.2.5 are vulnerable, except for 2.47.0 which throws a TypeError. Versions <= 2.2.5 are not vulnerable because the body is wrapped with '\\r\\n' before being passed to the buffer.",
        "fix": "The vulnerability was fixed by coercing the body option to a string before creating the buffer. The fix was included in version 2.69.0 and later.",
        "notes":"The vulnerability was present when using the `multipart` option in a `request` call and setting the `body` of one of the multipart elements to a number. This number would be used as the size for a buffer and the buffer would be sent without any initialization, leaking the content of the memory."
