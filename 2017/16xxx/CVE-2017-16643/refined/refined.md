{
  "CVE-2017-16643": {
    "Description": "Andrey Konovalov reported that the gtco tablet driver did not fully validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer over-read. A physically present user with a specially designed USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).",
    "Root cause": "The `parse_hid_report_descriptor` function in the gtco tablet driver has a while loop that reads bytes from a buffer, but the loop body can read multiple bytes while only checking if there's at least one byte available, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A physically present attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "A physically present attacker with a specially designed USB device.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be physically present and have the ability to use a specially crafted USB device."
