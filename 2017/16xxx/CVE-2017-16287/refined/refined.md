- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Insteon Hub firmware has a vulnerability in the PubNub message handler for the “cc” channel. The handler uses the `cJSON` library to parse JSON messages, and it utilizes `strcpy` to copy values from the parsed JSON objects into stack buffers. The `strcpy` function does not perform bounds checking, thus allowing for a stack-based buffer overflow if the incoming JSON values are longer than the allocated buffer sizes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities are present due to the usage of `strcpy` without proper bounds checking when handling JSON messages. Specifically, when parsing various parameters within different commands sent via the "cc" channel of PubNub, the firmware copies data into fixed-size stack buffers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting these buffer overflows, an attacker can overwrite arbitrary data on the stack, including $s-registers, the saved program counter, and the saved frame pointer. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send specially crafted JSON messages through the PubNub service to the Insteon Hub device. These messages are sent using an HTTP GET request, embedding the JSON string in the URL path. The attacker needs a valid authentication key to interact with the device via PubNub.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the PubNub service.
    - The attacker needs to know the device's PubNub publish and subscribe keys.
    - The attacker needs to know the Insteon ID of the hub (derived from the MAC address).
    - The attacker must have a valid authentication key for the device.
    - The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the Insteon Hub, as the communication occurs through the PubNub service.
