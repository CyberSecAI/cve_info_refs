    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2017-16577",
      "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the alignment attribute of Field objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object within the alignment attribute of Field objects.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
      "Attack Vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
        "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file or webpage that exploits the Field object alignment attribute vulnerability."
