{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the output HTML, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or malware distribution.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The 'description' parameter in the `/Calendar/CalendarActions.aspx` URL",
        "The 'det' and 'title' parameters in the `/Scanning/report.aspx` URL",
        "The 'det' and 'title' parameters in the `/Software/report.aspx` URL"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into visiting it. No special privileges or access to the target system is required, as this is a client-side vulnerability."
