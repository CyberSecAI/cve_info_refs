Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in GraphicsMagick, a set of
command-line applications to manipulate image files, which could result
in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if malformed
image files are processed.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.30+hg15796-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.

For the detailed security status of graphicsmagick please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/graphicsmagick>

Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 26. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '26'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 26 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1494552#c12)  Jan Kurik    2018-05-31 08:06:17 UTC  ``` This bug has been reported against a Fedora version which is already unsuported. In compliance with FESCo decision how to handle EOL of Security issues [1], I am changing the version to '27', the latest supported release.  Please check whether this bug is still an issue on the '27' release. If you find this bug not being applicable on this release, please close it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-02-08 06:28:09 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-02-08 06:28:13 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1543272,1543274  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c2)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 17:10:01 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 27 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-06-17 20:51:51 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-da4c20882c has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-da4c20882c>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-06-17 20:52:30 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-425a1aa7c9 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-425a1aa7c9>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1543274#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-06-18 01:38:14 UTC  ``` GraphicsMagick-1.3.32-1.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.

Various vulnerabilities were discovered in graphicsmagick, a collection
of image processing tools and associated libraries, resulting in denial
of service, information disclosure, and a variety of buffer overflows
and overreads.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.20-3+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Binary packages built by this source

[graphicsmagick](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/graphicsmagick):
collection of image processing tools

GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate

Â image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers

Â a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.

Â .

Â The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used

Â jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image

Â formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,

Â concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create

Â thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available

Â from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that

Â allows interactive manipulation.

Â .

Â Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed

Â through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and

Â ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package

Â graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables

Â that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

[graphicsmagick-dbg](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/graphicsmagick-dbg):
format-independent image processing - debugging symbols

GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,

Â write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the

Â widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or

Â image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained

Â image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various

Â image formats.

Â .

Â The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers

Â an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable

Â across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the

Â GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,

Â conversion can usually be done with little effort.

Â .

Â This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the

Â C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these

Â symbols.

[graphicsmagick-dbgsym](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/graphicsmagick-dbgsym):
debug symbols for package graphicsmagick

GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate

Â image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers

Â a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.

image processing tools providing ImageMagick interface

GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate

Â image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers

Â a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.

Â .

Â With this package installed, the GraphicsMagick command line tools can

Â be executed like their ImageMagick counterparts. It allows one to migrate

Â scripts from ImageMagick to GraphicsMagick without any code changes.

[graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat):
image processing libraries providing ImageMagick interface

GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,

Â write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the

Â widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or

Â image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained

Â image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various

Â image formats.

Â .

Â The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer

Â programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be

Â small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible

Â subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.

Â .

Â While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and

Â helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package

Â intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick

Â interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only

Â tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of

Â ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.

Â .

Â This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl

Â libraries.

[libgraphics-magick-perl](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/libgraphics-magick-perl):
format-independent image processing - perl interface

GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,

Â write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the

Â widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or

Â image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained

Â image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various

Â across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the

Â GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,

Â conversion can usually be done with little effort.

Â .

Â This package contains the classes to access GraphicsMagick functionality from

Â Perl scripts. It is mostly similar to PerlMagick from the ImageMagick suite,

Â but uses a different class name.
