Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-16850:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `resourceid` parameter within the `/showresource.do` endpoint of ManageEngine Applications Manager. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `resourceid` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the application's database.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker might gain unauthorized access to application functionality or resources.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database setup and permissions, it might be possible for an attacker to elevate their privileges within the system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, a successful SQL injection can lead to complete compromise of the application server and the underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/showresource.do` endpoint.
*   **`resourceid` Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `resourceid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ManageEngine Applications Manager instance.
*   **Authentication:** The blog post suggests these are post-authentication vulnerabilities, implying the attacker needs to have valid user credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported on November 16, 2017, and fixed on December 11, 2017, in build 13530.
*   The vulnerability is rated as CRITICAL with a CVSS v3 score of 9.8
*   The blog post also mentions other SQL injection vulnerabilities in the same application, some of which have separate CVEs assigned
*   The specific SQL injection point is in the `getResourceProfiles` action
*   A proof of concept is available on Github, which makes exploitation easier for attackers.

The provided information gives a good understanding of how the SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited. The vulnerability was present in ManageEngine Applications Manager 13, and was fixed in later versions.
