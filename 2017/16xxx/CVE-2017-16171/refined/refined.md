The provided content is a file listing from a GitHub repository, specifically the `hcbserver` directory within the `directory-traversal` folder of the `NPM-Vuln-PoC` repository. This repository appears to contain proof-of-concept code for vulnerabilities, which aligns with the potential for a directory traversal vulnerability as suggested by the folder name.

However, this page **does not contain any details about the vulnerability itself.** It only shows the file structure and names. Specifically, it lists `PoC.sh`, `attack.js`, and `test.js` as files within the `hcbserver` directory.

Therefore, without the content of these files, we cannot determine the specifics of the vulnerability.
