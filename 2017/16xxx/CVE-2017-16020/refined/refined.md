The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16020.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of `eval()` in `lib/drivers/search/pouch.js`. The code constructs a filter function using string concatenation and then executes it using `eval()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is code injection. The `opts.collection` variable, which can be a string or an array, is directly embedded into the string that is then evaluated by `eval()`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the filter function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting arbitrary JavaScript code, an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the application, leading to data theft, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject a malicious payload through the `opts.collection` parameter. Specifically, instead of valid collection names, the attacker provides JavaScript code that is executed by the `eval` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over the `opts.collection` parameter. This could involve manipulating user input that gets passed to the affected code.
