- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input validation in the Log Viewer of Synology Photo Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Log Viewer fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing injection of malicious scripts. Specifically, the `username` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting malicious script through the vulnerable `username` parameter, likely via a crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any user privileges to inject the malicious script. The user must, however, interact with the injected script for the attack to be successful (user interaction required).
