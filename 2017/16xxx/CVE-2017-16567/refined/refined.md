```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when adding a new favorite, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script code.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access the favorites page. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vectors: The attacker adds a new favorite with malicious JavaScript code as the value of the field through the application's web interface.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the application's web interface and add a new favorite.
