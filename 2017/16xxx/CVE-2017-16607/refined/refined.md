    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2017-16607",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to download a heap memory dump.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information by downloading the process's heap memory. This memory can contain sensitive data such as credentials.",

        "HTTP GET request to `/u/jsp/settings/heapdumps.jsp?dumpnow=1`"

      "additional_details": "The attacker can then search the memory for interesting information such as credentials. For example, Tenable found the admin username and password in a dump using the following method: `strings ./heapdump_2017_03_07_15_48_34.bin | grep username=`"
