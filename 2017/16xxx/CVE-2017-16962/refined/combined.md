# Exploit Title: CommuniGatePro webmails Multiple Stored XSS
# Date: 15/11/2017
# Exploit Author: Boumediene KADDOUR
# Unit: Algerie Telecom R&D Unit
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.stalker.com/
# Software Link: http://www.stalker.com/ (paid product)
# Version: 6.1.16<
# Tested on: production server on crystal, pronto and pronto4 webmails from gmail and hotmail.

CommuniGatePro 6.1.16 webmails (crystal, pronto and pronto4) suffer from multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities. The bellow details illustrate the impact of this vulnerability.

Vulnerability Description:

XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user supplied data using a browser API that can create JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

Vulnerability details (Stored XSS):

This vulnerability allowed us to gain access to the following:

    Control the victim's mailbox by just reading my email

    Control the victim's computer in case the person uses Internet Explorer 8 which is widely used in our company.

    Send emails on behalf the victim

    Deface the whole victim mailbox

    Invoke the malicious piece of code each time an attachment's sent to the victim.

Vulnerable sections:

    Calendar

    Files

    Tasks

    Notes

    ​Inbox

Attack Narratives and Scenarios:

1. Calendar:

Source webmail: tested with gmail and hotmail

Destination webmail: Crystal

In order to deliver our PoC, we have taken the advantages of google calendar to achieve our goal.

PoC:

POST /calendar/event HTTP/1.1

Host: calendar.google.com

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0

Accept: */*

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Referer: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?tab=mc

X-If-No-Redirect: 1

X-Is-Xhr-Request: 1

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8

Content-Length: 634

Cookie: Mycookie

Connection: close

​sf=true&output=js&action=CREATE&useproto=true&add=boumediene.k%40victim.dz%2Csnbemail%40gmail.com&crm=BUSY&icc=DEFAULT&sprop=goo.allowModify%3Afalse&sprop=goo.allowInvitesOther%3Atrue&sprop=goo.showInvitees%3Atrue&pprop=eventColor%3Anone&eid=762dgnlok9l44rd63im4kisjnd&eref=762dgnlok9l33rd55im4kisjnd&cts=1511425384353&text=%22%3E%3Cimg%20src%3DX%20onerror%3Dalert(document.cookie)%3E&location=Stored%20XSS&details=Stored%20XSS&src=snbemail%40gmail.com&dates=20171123T093000%2F20171123T103000&unbounded=false&gdoc-attachment&scfdata=W1tdXQ..&stz&etz&scp=ONE&nopts=2&nopts=3&nopts=4&hl=en_GB&secid=6VLs1BGsgBB_Tqz6egnXpCYYF24

Once the victim receives the invitation, he/she will not be obliged to click on any link or download any file. The only condition for this PoC to work is a single click to read the email. Once the victim reads the email, the code gets executed on the victim's browser ending up sending sensitive data to the adversary.

2. Files:

Source webmail: pronto/pronto4/Crystal

Destination webmail: Crystal

In order to leverage this vulnerability, a victim must first acquire a local mailbox. What he/she will do is the following:

    Go to file section.

    Create a directory

    Name the directory with any JavaScript code, in our case  (<img src=X onerror=alert(document.cookie)>)

    Share or grant access to victim to be able to at least read the content of the directory

    The victim then recieves the email of granting access to that directory

    The vitim reads the email and then accesses the directory ending up executing the code within its scope of work

3. Notes:

Source webmail: Crystal

Destination webmail: Crystal

In order to leverage this vulnerability, a victim must first acquire a local mailbox. What he/she will do is the following:

    Create a note

    Put the JavaScript code within it

    Share it with the victim

4. Tasks:

Source webmail: pronto/pronto4

Destination webmail: Crystal

In order to leverage this vulnerability, a victim must first acquire a local mailbox. What he/she will do is the following:

    Create a task

    Put the JavaScript code within the task name

    publish it

5. Inbox

Source webmail: pronto/pronto4

Destination webmail: Crystal

In order to leverage this vulnerability, a victim must first acquire a local mailbox. What he/she will do is the following:

    Create an html file with malicious JavaScript piece of code

    Make use of Pronto to send the email to the victim

    The victim reads the email using Crystal webmail and the code gets executed.

​Remediation:

Sanitize, escape and validate user supplied data accordingly

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
