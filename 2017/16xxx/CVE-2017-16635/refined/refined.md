The content is related to CVE-2017-16635.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input sanitization when creating new files or folders. Specifically, the `mkname` and `mkitem` parameters of the `Add/Create` module in the TWG Explorer web application do not filter out malicious script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the application. This can lead to phishing, session hijacking, persistent external redirects to malicious sources, and client-side manipulation of affected or connected web module context.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers with low privilege user accounts can inject malicious script code via the `mkname` and `mkitem` parameters when adding/creating new items (files/folders) in the TWG explorer module. The attack vector is located on the application-side of the service. The injection point is the add/create input field and the execution point occurs in the item listing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a restricted privilege user account to access the backend of the TinyWebGallery application. No user interaction is required after the injection. The injected code will execute when an administrator or other user visits the item listing.
