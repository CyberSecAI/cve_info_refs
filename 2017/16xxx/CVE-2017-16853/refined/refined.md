{
  "CVE-2017-16853": {
    "Description": "The DynamicMetadataProvider class in saml/saml2/metadata/impl/DynamicMetadataProvider.cpp in OpenSAML-C in OpenSAML before 2.6.1 fails to properly configure itself with the MetadataFilter plugins and does not perform critical security checks such as signature verification, enforcement of validity periods, and other checks specific to deployments.",
    "Root cause": "A coding error in the DynamicMetadataProvider class prevents it from properly configuring itself with MetadataFilter plugins.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The DynamicMetadataProvider plugin fails to configure itself with the filters provided.",
      "Critical security checks such as signature verification, enforcement of validity periods, and other deployment-specific checks are omitted."
    ],
    "Impact": "Deployments become vulnerable to active attacks involving the substitution of metadata if the network path to the query service is compromised. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other security breaches.",
    "Attack vectors": "Compromise of the network path to the metadata query service, allowing an attacker to substitute malicious metadata.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the service provider and the metadata query service."
  }
