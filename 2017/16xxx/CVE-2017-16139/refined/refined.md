The provided content is a directory listing from a GitHub repository, specifically the `jikes` folder within a directory traversal example. It doesn't contain any information about the CVE-2017-16139, its root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors, or required attacker capabilities. The files present (PoC.sh, attack.js, test.js) suggest that this directory is intended to demonstrate a directory traversal vulnerability, but without the code content it is impossible to infer if it relates to CVE-2017-16139.

Therefore, the content is considered **NOINFO**.
