{
  "CVE-2017-16227": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `aspath_put` function in `bgpd/bgp_aspath.c` incorrectly calculates the size of the AS_PATH attribute in BGP UPDATE messages when the path is segmented. This happens when there are more than two segments in the AS path, causing certain bytes to be counted twice.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Incorrect AS_PATH size calculation leading to malformed BGP messages.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to BGP session termination. Repeated session drops can lead to loss of network connectivity and increased network load due to full table transfers.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending BGP UPDATE messages with long AS paths that have more than two segments.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send BGP UPDATE messages to a vulnerable Quagga BGP daemon, making them a BGP peer of the target."
