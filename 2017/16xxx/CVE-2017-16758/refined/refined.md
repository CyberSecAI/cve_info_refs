Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Ultimate Instagram Feed" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin was not sanitizing the `shortcode`, `url`, and `access_token` parameters before using them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin was vulnerable to XSS because it directly outputted the `access_token` parameter from the URL and the `shortcode` and `url` parameters from POST data without sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through these parameters, which would be executed in the context of a user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or website defacement.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The plugin was directly using unsanitized user input (`$_POST['shortcode']`, `$_POST['url']`, `$_GET['access_token']`) when saving shortcodes, URLs, and access tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** If exploited, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could allow them to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive information (cookies, session tokens), redirect the user to malicious websites, or deface the website.
*   **Data Manipulation/Injection:** By injecting malicious code through shortcode and URL parameters, an attacker might also be able to corrupt or inject data, potentially compromising the site's functionality or integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The `access_token` was vulnerable to XSS by manipulating the `$_GET` parameter in the URL of the WordPress admin panel.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The `shortcode` and `url` parameters, submitted through POST requests, were also vulnerable to XSS if not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs or POST requests to send malicious payloads to the vulnerable plugin.
*   They would need some level of access to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed to trigger the vulnerability. This access could be as an administrator, editor or even a low-privileged user, depending on how the plugin processes the unsanitized input and if it's visible to others.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   The changeset includes sanitization using `sanitize_text_field` for the `shortcode`, `url`, and `access_token` parameters. This indicates the plugin authors were aware of the security issues and took steps to address them in version 1.3 of the plugin.
*   The changelog also mentions a fix related to comment for 'location' which is unrelated to the vulnerability.
