  "cve": "CVE-2017-16994",
  "description": "The walk_hugetlb_range() function in 'mm/pagewalk.c' file in the Linux kernel from v4.0-rc1 through v4.15-rc1 mishandles holes in hugetlb ranges, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized kernel memory via crafted use of the mincore() system call.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "v4.0-rc1 through v4.15-rc1"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The `walk_hugetlb_range()` function in `mm/pagewalk.c` doesn't properly report holes in hugetlb ranges, leading to uninitialized memory exposure.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Information leak",
     "Uninitialized memory exposure"
  ],
  "impact": "Local users can obtain sensitive information from uninitialized kernel memory via the `mincore()` system call.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Local access",
     "`mincore()` system call",
     "Crafted use of hugetlb ranges"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "Local access, ability to create memory mappings with hugetlb.",
  "patch": "The fix modifies `walk_hugetlb_range()` in `mm/pagewalk.c` to ensure that holes in hugetlb ranges are reported by explicitly calling `walk->pte_hole` if the `pte` is null, and also ensures `walk->pte_hole` is checked before calling `walk->hugetlb_entry`."
