```
{
  "CVE-2017-16996": {
    "Root cause": "The BPF verifier did not properly handle register truncation to a smaller size. When `coerce_reg_to_32()` was called on a number with bounds [0xffff'fff8, 0x1'0000'0007], the verifier incorrectly computed [0xffff'fff8, 0xffff'ffff] as the bounds of the truncated number. The actual truncated number could be in the range [0, 7].",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of register truncation",
      "Incorrect arithmetic bounds calculation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have other unspecified impacts by exploiting this vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation through crafted BPF programs",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to load BPF programs. Starting with v4.14 of the Linux kernel, this is possible for unprivileged users if the `unprivileged_bpf_disabled` sysctl is not set."
