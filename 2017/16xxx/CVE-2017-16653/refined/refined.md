Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The CSRF protection mechanism in Symfony did not differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS connections when generating tokens. This meant that the same token could be used for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability was the lack of namespace separation for CSRF tokens, making them vulnerable to replay attacks.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Exposure:** A token obtained over an insecure HTTP connection could be intercepted by an attacker using a Man-in-the-Middle attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF Attack:** An attacker who intercepts a CSRF token from a user's HTTP connection could use it in an HTTPS context to perform unauthorized actions on the user's behalf. This could lead to account compromise or other malicious activities, depending on the application's functionality.
- **Bypass CSRF protection:** By obtaining a token via an insecure HTTP connection, an attacker could then utilize it to bypass CSRF protection mechanisms within an HTTPS secured context, leading to actions such as modifying user data, initiating transactions, or exploiting other features of an application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker could set up a MITM attack on an HTTP connection to intercept CSRF tokens generated for a user.
- **Replay Attack:** The attacker would then reuse the intercepted token to make malicious requests against the same user via HTTPS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic, specifically HTTP traffic.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a MITM attack.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to access an HTTP site and capture the CSRF token.
- The attacker needs to have an understanding of the applicationâ€™s functionality in order to make malicious requests using the stolen token.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affected Symfony versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.37, 2.8.0 to 2.8.30, 3.2.0 to 3.2.13, and 3.3.0 to 3.3.12.
- The fix involves namespacing the CSRF tokens by the connection scheme (HTTP or HTTPS).
- This issue affects various parts of Symfony that use CSRF protection including the Form component, login/logout security listeners, and direct usage of the `security.csrf.token_manager` service or the `CsrfTokenManager`
- A patch was released in Symfony versions 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5, and 4.0-BETA5.
- The previous behavior can be restored by using `''` as namespace.
- Debian security advisory DSA-4262-1 also mentions this CVE as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in their security update for symfony.
