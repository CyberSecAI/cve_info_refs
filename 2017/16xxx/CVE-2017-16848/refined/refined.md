The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in ManageEngine Applications Manager 13. CVE-2017-16848 is specifically mentioned as one of the identifiers assigned to these vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in multiple parameters within the ManageEngine Applications Manager 13 web application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in several parameters:
    - `/manageApplications.do?method=AddSubGroup` (parameter `haid`)
    - `/showresource.do?resourceid=10000015` (parameter `resourceid`)
    - `/manageConfMons.do` (parameter `groupname`)
    - `/MyPage.do?method=viewDashBoard&forpage=1` (parameter `forpage`)
    - `/showresource.do?resourceid=10000015` (parameter `resourceid` - again, indicating multiple instances of the vulnerability)
    - `/MyPage.do` (parameter `widgetid`)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    - Access sensitive information stored in the database
    - Modify or delete data in the database
    - Potentially gain control over the underlying system

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious SQL code injected into vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the ManageEngine Applications Manager 13 web application.
- The vulnerabilities appear to be post-authentication, meaning the attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the vulnerable endpoints.
- Based on the blog, the attacker used `sqlmap` to verify the vulnerability, indicating that no special tools were required beyond commonly used web security tools.
