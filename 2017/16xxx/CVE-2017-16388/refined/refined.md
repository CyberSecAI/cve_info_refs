The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16388.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is categorized as a use-after-free. This means that the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, which can lead to a crash or allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The document does not specify the exact attack vector, but given the context of Adobe Acrobat and Reader, it's likely triggered by a maliciously crafted PDF document. This means an attacker could distribute a specially crafted PDF that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability when opened by a vulnerable version of Acrobat or Reader.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to deliver a malicious PDF document to a victim using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
