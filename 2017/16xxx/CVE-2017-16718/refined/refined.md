- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a fixed, hardcoded cryptographic key to encrypt credentials when adding routes in the ADS router of Beckhoff TwinCAT 3.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the usage of a hardcoded cryptographic key (CWE-321). This allows an attacker to extract the key and subsequently decrypt sensitive credentials (usernames and passwords) used for route configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decrypt the credentials used to create ADS routes. This could enable them to gain unauthorized access to the system or other connected devices.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs network access to observe and intercept the encrypted credentials while routes are being added.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the system while a route with encrypted credentials is being added. They must also be able to extract the fixed cryptographic key, likely by reverse engineering the affected software.
