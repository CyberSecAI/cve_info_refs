The provided content details two vulnerabilities in the UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin: an authenticated arbitrary file upload leading to code execution and an authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**1. Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload and PHP Code Execution**

*   **Root Cause:** The `plupload_action` function in `/wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/admin.php` allows authenticated users to upload files with a user-controlled name. Although a basic filename check is performed, a valid backup filename like `backup_2017-11-29-1844_test_d6c634e49869-plugins.zip` can be used. The file content is then moved to the specified location, and shortly after the file is deleted.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of file content, coupled with the race condition created by the delay between the file write and delete operations.
*   **Impact:** A malicious user with the required privileges can upload a file containing PHP code. By accessing the uploaded file before it is deleted, they can execute the arbitrary PHP code. This can lead to complete server compromise.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack involves uploading a file with a crafted filename and malicious PHP code as its content using the `plupload_action` function.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to upload files.

**2. Authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `updraft_ajax_handler` function in `/wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/admin.php` calls the `http_get` function when the `subaction` parameter is set to `httpget`. The `http_get` function uses `curl` to make a request to a user-provided URL.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability arises from the plugin making server-side requests without proper sanitization or validation of the URL.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can use this to perform Server-Side Request Forgery attacks, potentially accessing internal network resources or interacting with external services, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further exploits.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack involves sending a specially crafted AJAX request to the `updraft_ajax_handler` function with `subaction` set to `httpget`, and a malicious URL to the `curl` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the WordPress admin panel with sufficient permissions to access the relevant AJAX handler.
