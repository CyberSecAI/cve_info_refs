Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.reports.export_005fdownload_jsp` servlet within NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager. This servlet does not properly validate user-supplied paths within the `filename` parameter before using them in file operations.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The core weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability. The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to manipulate the `filename` parameter to access files outside of the intended directory.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information on the vulnerable system.  The advisory notes it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to gain code execution in the context of an Administrator.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected servlet, specifically targeting the `filename` parameter. Authentication is required, but the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected server on TCP port 8081 (by default). They also need to bypass authentication (this bypass is also a vulnerability).

In summary, this is a directory traversal vulnerability that allows for information disclosure and potentially further compromise through other vulnerabilities.
