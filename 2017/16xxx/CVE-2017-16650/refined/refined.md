{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The QMI WWAN USB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device descriptors, leading to a potential divide-by-zero error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of USB device descriptors",
      "Potential divide-by-zero error"
    ],
    "impact": "A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physically connecting a malicious USB device."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the vulnerable system and ability to connect a USB device.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability occurs in the `usbnet_update_max_qlen` function, which attempts a division based on the `wMaxSegmentSize` field of a CDC Ethernet functional descriptor.  A descriptor with `wMaxSegmentSize=0` leads to the divide-by-zero. The fix involves ignoring the invalid descriptor if the wMaxSegmentSize is 0, as this field is optional for QMI devices."
