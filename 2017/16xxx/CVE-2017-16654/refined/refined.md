{
  "cve": "CVE-2017-16654",
  "description": "The Intl component includes various bundle readers that are used to read resource bundles from the local filesystem. The `read()` methods of these classes use a path and a locale to determine the language bundle to retrieve. The locale argument value is commonly retrieved from untrusted user input (like a URL parameter). An attacker can use this argument to navigate to arbitrary directories via the dot-dot-slash attack.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `read()` methods in the Intl component's bundle readers do not properly sanitize the locale argument, allowing directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use a crafted locale value to access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure or other unauthorized actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The locale argument is often retrieved from untrusted user input, such as URL parameters."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control the locale argument passed to the `read()` method of the Intl component's bundle readers."
  },
  "patch": "The fix implements a check on the built filename to not break out of the path that was passed as an argument to the `read()` method."
