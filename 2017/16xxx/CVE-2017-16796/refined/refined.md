Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the GitHub issue, which appear to be related to CVE-2017-16796:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Logic error in `png_load` function. The code doesn't check if `realloc` returns `NULL` (failure). If `realloc` fails, the code proceeds to write data to the memory location pointed by `zimagedatalen`, which may lead to an arbitrary write.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of error handling after a `realloc` call.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary memory write, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*  **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PNG input. The attacker can control the value of `zimagedatalen`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a specially crafted PNG file to be processed by the vulnerable software

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Logic error in `png_read_chunk` function. The code doesn't check if `malloc` returns `NULL` (failure). If `malloc` fails, the code sets `*destdata` to 0. Subsequently a `fread` will write data at address 0, resulting in a crash.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of error handling after a `malloc` call.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service due to a crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PNG input. The attacker can trigger a `malloc` failure.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a specially crafted PNG file to be processed by the vulnerable software that would cause malloc to fail.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*  **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in `png_load`. The code calculates the buffer size by multiplying `header.width`, `header.height` and a constant (4), these are 4 bytes, while the allocated size, `alleclen_64` is 8 bytes. This can lead to integer overflow as the product may exceed the maximum 32 bit value, resulting in a smaller value.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Heap overflow, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PNG input. The attacker can control `header.width` and `header.height` to cause the integer overflow when multiplied.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a specially crafted PNG file to be processed by the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue report provides specific code locations for each vulnerability, making it easier to understand the exact location of the bugs.
*  The vulnerabilities are in the `png2swf` tool which is part of the `swftools` project.
* The described vulnerabilities are related to handling of PNG images, especially concerning memory allocation and data writing
