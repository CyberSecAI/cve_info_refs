## Description

[![@jimmed](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/318961?u=0aad8fa2edae5c7ec4f1ce6a635ceda845439a9f&v=4&size=48)](/jimmed)[jimmed](https://github.com/jimmed)opened [on Jul 17, 2014](https://github.com/apostrophecms/sanitize-html/issues/19#issue-38087788)

Entering the following:

```
<IMG SRC= onmouseover="alert('XSS');">
```

produces the following:

```
<img src="onmouseover="alert('XSS');"" />
```

This is definitely invalid HTML, but would suggest that it's being interpreted incorrectly by the parser. I would expect:

```
<img src="" />
```
