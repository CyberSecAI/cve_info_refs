Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `sanitize-html` library's incorrect parsing of HTML attributes, specifically when encountering empty, undelimited attributes. The library fails to properly handle cases where an attribute value is missing or not enclosed in quotes, leading to the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect HTML parsing:** The core weakness is in the library's parsing logic. It incorrectly interprets an input like `<IMG SRC= onmouseover="alert('XSS');">` which should be `<img src="" />` to `<img src="onmouseover="alert('XSS');"" />`.
*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code through the `onmouseover` event handler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that is executed when a user interacts with the manipulated HTML element (in this case, when the mouse hovers over the image).
*   **Information theft:** Attackers could use the injected JavaScript to steal user cookies or other sensitive data.
*   **Website defacement:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious sites or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious input:** The attacker injects malicious HTML code, including Javascript event handlers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Input injection:** The attacker needs the ability to inject HTML content that is then processed by the vulnerable `sanitize-html` library.
*   **User interaction:** Exploitation of the `onmouseover` attribute requires some user interaction, such as hovering their mouse over the manipulated element.

**More Details than CVE:**

The provided content offers a concrete example of the exploit with the following input:

```html
<IMG SRC= onmouseover="alert('XSS');">
```

The content also shows the vulnerable output:

```html
<img src="onmouseover="alert('XSS');"" />
```

This demonstrates how the library incorrectly handles the missing quotes around `SRC=` and the subsequent `onmouseover` attribute, leading to the injection of malicious javascript. Furthermore, the pull request and commit information show the fix was to strip any unescaped double quotes from the output.
