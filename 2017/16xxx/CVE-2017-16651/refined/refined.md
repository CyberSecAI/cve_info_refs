**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation within Roundcube Webmail's file-based attachment plugins. This allows for a file disclosure vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted request to the `_task=settings&_action=upload-display&_from=timezone` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- File Disclosure vulnerability.
- Lack of proper input validation when handling file uploads, specifically related to attachment plugins.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the host's filesystem.
- Exposure of sensitive information such as Roundcube's configuration files, including database credentials.
- Potential compromise of user data and server infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP requests to a specific endpoint (`_task=settings&_action=upload-display&_from=timezone`) with a crafted payload.
- Exploitation occurs via the file-based attachment plugins.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid username and password to authenticate to the Roundcube webmail installation and establish an active session before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild in November 2017.
- The issue affected Roundcube Webmail versions before 1.1.10, 1.2.x before 1.2.7, and 1.3.x before 1.3.3.
- Patches were released for versions 1.1.10, 1.2.7 and 1.3.3, also the fix was backported to 1.0.12 to prevent exploitation.
- Mitigation recommendations include changing credentials for external services and the `des_key` option, as well as examining access logs for suspicious requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
