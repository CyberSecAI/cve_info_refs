| [Description](#c0)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-08-31 11:49:01 UTC  ``` The init script for ASSP launches a perl script as root,    start-stop-daemon ... --startas /usr/share/assp/assp.pl  but that script is owned by the "assp" user,    -rwxr-xr-x 1 assp assp 1787042 Aug 31 07:44 /usr/share/assp/assp.pl  so he can run whatever he wants as root when the service is started. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Christopher Díaz Riveros (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2017-10-05 20:09:14 UTC  ``` @Maintainer please call for stabilization when ready.  @mjo was this reported upstream? It would be good to request a CVE for this issue if possible too.  Thank you,  Gentoo Security Padawan ChrisADR ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Orlitzky   gentoo-dev  2017-10-06 01:48:38 UTC  ``` Our ebuild does,    # Lock down the files/data   fowners assp:assp -R /usr/share/assp  so I don't think it's an upstream issue, but you'd have to dig through their build system to rule it out. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Christopher Díaz Riveros (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2017-10-06 02:06:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Michael Orlitzky from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=629442#c2)) > Our ebuild does, >  >   # Lock down the files/data >   fowners assp:assp -R /usr/share/assp >  > so I don't think it's an upstream issue, but you'd have to dig through their > build system to rule it out.
