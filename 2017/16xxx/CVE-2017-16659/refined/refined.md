The content is related to CVE-2017-16659.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The init script for ASSP launches a perl script as root, `/usr/share/assp/assp.pl`, however this script is owned by the "assp" user.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Privilege escalation vulnerability where a user can modify the perl script and execute arbitrary code as root.
- Insecure file permissions and ownership that allows a non-root user to modify a file executed by root.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution as root.
- Full system compromise is possible.

Attack vectors:
- Attacker modifies the `/usr/share/assp/assp.pl` script

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to have write access to the `/usr/share/assp/assp.pl` file. This is typically the "assp" user.
