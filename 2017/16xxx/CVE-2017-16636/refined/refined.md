- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A filter bypass vulnerability exists in the Bludit CMS editor that allows attackers to inject malicious script code by using specific tags not recognized by the basic validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the editor, combined with a filter bypass. The editor's basic validation fails to block certain tags, allowing the injection of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to persistent phishing attacks, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sources, and manipulation of web module context. Attackers can potentially gain control over user accounts and modify content, or redirect victims to attacker-controlled websites.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious script code into the body message input of the editor (new page, edit post) or the category name field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a low-privileged user account on the affected Bludit CMS. The vulnerability can be triggered through the editor. Low user interaction is required for exploitation.
