Technical Details & Description:
================================
A cross site scripting web vulnerability and a filter bypass issue has been discovered in the official Bludit v1.5.2 CMS.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code on the application-side of affected web modules
or service function. The filter bypass issue allows to evade the filter controls to trigger an execution of a payload.
The vulnerability is located in the new page, new category and edit post function body message context. Remote attackers are able
to bypass the basic editor validation to trigger a cross site scripting vulnerability. The attack vector of the issue is persistent
and the request method to inject via editor is GET. To save the editor context the followup post method request must be processed
to perform the attack via application-side.
The basic validation of the editor does not allow to inject script codes and blocks the context. Attackers can inject the code
by usage of the editor tag which are not recognized by the basic validation. Thus allows a restricted user account to inject
malicious script code to perform a persistent attack against higher privilege web-application user accounts.
Exploitation of the web vulnerability requires low privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks, session hijacking, persistent
external redirect to malicious sources and persistent manipulation of affected or connected web module context.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Editor - (New Page & Edit Post)
[+] New Category - (Input Fields)
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the page web-application
2. Move to the edit-post, edit-category or new-page module
Note: Now the editor will appear
3. Include the payload to the body message input or as name value to the category input field
Note: The payload requires the tags used for the format to bypass the basic validation
4. Save or preview the post to trigger the execution point
5. Successful reproduce of the filter bypass vulnerability!
