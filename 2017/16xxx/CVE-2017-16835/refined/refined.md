Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `android:allowBackup="true"` attribute being set in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file of the "Photo, Video Locker-Calculator" application. This setting allows the app's data to be backed up and retrieved using the Android Debug Bridge (adb).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Backup Configuration:** The `android:allowBackup` attribute being set to "true" allows any user with adb access to create a backup of the app's data.
- **Lack of Encryption:** Files stored within the application's designated vault directory (`/apps/smart.calculator.gallerylock/f/lockerVault/`) are not encrypted, allowing direct access to the files within the backup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can bypass the app's PIN protection and directly access all files (photos and videos) stored within the app's vault.
- **Loss of Privacy:** Sensitive user data is exposed.
- **Circumvention of Security Measures:** The app's claims of secure storage are completely invalidated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** Requires physical access to the device.
- **ADB Access:** Requires a computer with the Android Debug Bridge (adb) installed and enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the Android device.
- The attacker needs to have adb enabled on the device and have a machine with the Android Debug Bridge (adb) installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute adb commands and have the knowledge to extract the backup and the files from the backup.

**Additional Information**
- The content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the specific adb commands to exploit it, the location of the sensitive files and how to convert the backup to a readable format.
- It also confirms that the files are not encrypted.
