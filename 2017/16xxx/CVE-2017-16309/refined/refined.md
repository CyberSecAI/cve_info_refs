- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Insteon Hub firmware uses the `strcpy` function to copy data from JSON messages received via the PubNub service into fixed-size stack buffers without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities. There are multiple instances of `strcpy` being used to copy attacker-controlled string data into fixed-size stack buffers without proper size validation.
-  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite stack memory, including saved registers and return addresses, leading to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
-  **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted JSON messages to the "cc" channel via the PubNub service. The message is sent via an HTTP GET request containing the JSON payload in the URL path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send authenticated HTTP requests to the PubNub service. This requires knowledge of the device's PubNub publish/subscribe keys, the channel name, the authentication key, and the Insteon device ID (MAC address).
- **Specific CVE details:** This entry specifically covers the buffer overflow vulnerability in the `strcpy` call at address `0x9d01b3d8`, when parsing the "d" key for the "sn_exw" command.
```
{"cmd": "sn_exw", "id": "x", "flg": "x", "cmd1": "x", "cmd2": "x", "d": "OVERFLOW"}
```
 The `d` parameter is copied to a 100-byte buffer at `$sp+0x334`.
