- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the User Policy editor of Synology MailPlus Server, specifically within the "name" parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, potentially leading to malicious actions being performed within the context of the user's session. This may include stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based (AV:N). An attacker would need to be authenticated with high privileges (PR:H). The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), as the injected code will execute in the context of another user's session after they access a page with the injected code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileged access to the Synology MailPlus Server.
