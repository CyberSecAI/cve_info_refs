Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   SQL injection vulnerability in ManageEngine Applications Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `resourceid` parameter when rendering the plasma view.
*   Improper input sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Critical Impact:** The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 score of 9.8, indicating a critical impact.
*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to read sensitive database information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
*   **System Compromise:** In some scenarios, SQL injection could lead to further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is the `resourceid` parameter within the application's HTTP requests, specifically when rendering the plasma view.
*   The attacker manipulates the `resourceid` parameter by injecting malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability. The content indicates this is a *post-authentication* vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ManageEngine Applications Manager instance.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a solid understanding of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported on November 16, 2017, and fixed on December 11, 2017, in build 13530.
*   Affected builds are those up to 13520.
*   The blog post from `code610.blogspot.com` provides more context, showing the use of `sqlmap` to verify the vulnerability. It also mentions that several other SQL injection vulnerabilities were found and reported at the same time, with references to related CVEs.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by including the specific parameter (`resourceid`), affected versions, and a proof-of-concept using sqlmap.
