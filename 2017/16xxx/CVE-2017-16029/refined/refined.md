The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16029.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal issue. The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to use "../" sequences to navigate outside the intended working directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability: The application does not adequately validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by providing manipulated paths such as `../`. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's file handling functionality, where user-provided input is used to construct file paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the vulnerable application, specifically through the file path parameter.
