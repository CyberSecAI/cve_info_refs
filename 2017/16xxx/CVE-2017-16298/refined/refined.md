The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2017-16298.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `strcpy` function to copy data from a JSON message into fixed-size stack buffers without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to the usage of `strcpy`.
- Lack of input validation on the size of string values received from the PubNub service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution by overwriting saved registers, saved program counter, and saved frame pointer on the stack.
- Device crash due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted JSON message through the PubNub service to the "cc" channel.
- The JSON message needs to contain the "cmd": "s_schd", "offcmd" keys to reach the vulnerable code.
- Attacker needs to be authenticated and have the ability to send PubNub messages using the correct credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the PubNub service.
- The attacker needs to know the device ID and channel name to send the malicious message.
- The attacker needs to craft a JSON message containing the 's_schd' command and an `offcmd` key with an oversized value.

Specifically for CVE-2017-16298:
- The vulnerability exists when handling the "s_schd" command and parsing the "offcmd" key.
- The `strcpy` copies the value of the "offcmd" key to a buffer located at `$sp+0x334` which is 100 bytes in size. By providing a value longer than 100 bytes, the attacker can trigger a stack based buffer overflow.

```json
{"cmd": "s_schd", "grp": "x", "on": "x", "off": "x", "days": "x", "oncmd": "x", "offcmd": "OVERFLOW"}
```
