This GitHub page shows the directory structure and files for a project named `NPM-Vuln-PoC`, specifically focusing on a directory named `directory-traversal/zwserver`. The presence of files named `PoC.sh`, `attack.js`, and `test.js` in this directory suggests this is a proof-of-concept demonstrating a directory traversal vulnerability.

Based on the content, the following can be inferred:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The presence of a `directory-traversal` folder within the `NPM-Vuln-PoC` repository, along with the files `PoC.sh` and `attack.js` suggests the code within this directory likely has a directory traversal vulnerability. The filename "zwserver" may indicate a server application susceptible to this flaw.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The existence of files named `PoC.sh` and `attack.js` suggests the presence of a directory traversal vulnerability, which can allow attackers to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to read potentially sensitive files outside the intended directory. This could include configuration files, source code, or any data the user has access to.
*   **Attack vectors:** The `attack.js` file likely contains the code that exploits the vulnerability via an HTTP request, and the `PoC.sh` script likely demonstrates the attack.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable server (`zwserver`) with a malicious path in the request to perform the traversal. No specific attacker capabilities are detailed here, but a working knowledge of HTTP and directory traversal attacks would be necessary.

It is important to note that the specific code that is vulnerable is not shown in the provided text but can be inferred from the file names.
