The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16018.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ResourceNotFoundError` in `Router.prototype.find` does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the URL path), leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The error message includes the unsanitized URL path from the request, which can contain malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when they access a non-existent URL. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing user cookies and credentials
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement of the application
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the URL path to the server.
- The server then returns an error message that includes the unsanitized URL path, leading to the browser executing the JavaScript code when rendered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a HTTP request to the vulnerable server with a crafted URL.
- The attacker needs no special access or credentials. They only need to send a GET request to a non-existent path.
