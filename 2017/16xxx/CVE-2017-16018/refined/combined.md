## Description

[![@CycoPH](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2360950?v=4&size=48)](/CycoPH)[CycoPH](https://github.com/CycoPH)opened [on Feb 25, 2016](https://github.com/restify/node-restify/issues/1018#issue-136354068)

I tested my restify server with this:

<https://localhost:3000/no5_such3_file7.pl?%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(73541);%3C/script%3E>

The returned data contains "<script>alert(73541);</script>" which some browsers will execute.

Simple solution is to change the ResourceNotFoundError at the end of the Router.prototype.find to something like this:

callback(new ResourceNotFoundError('%s does not exist', url.parse(req.url).pathname));
