{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `graphlocal_graph_id` parameter, obtained from the `$_GET['graph']` variable, is directly used in an SQL query without any sanitization or input validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data manipulation, or denial of service by executing malicious SQL queries.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious GET request containing a payload within the `graph` parameter.",
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned as needed."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "vulnerable_code_location": "The vulnerability occurs within the `Eonweb_module/capacity_per_label/index.php` file, specifically around line 41 and line 80 in `module/capacity_per_graph/index.php`, where the unsanitized parameter is used.",
    "exploit_example": "The provided exploit example shows how to inject a SQL query using `graph=11%27%20and%20sleep(5)%20%23`. The `sleep(5)` function causes the page to delay for 5 seconds, demonstrating the successful injection.",
    "affected_software": "The vulnerability is located in the 'Eonweb' module of the 'EyesOfNetwork' project. The specific version mentioned is 5.1, but other versions may also be affected.",
   "more_details": "The provided details include the specific code location with line numbers, the vulnerable parameter, and the HTTP request for exploiting the vulnerability. This is more detailed than the typical CVE description."
