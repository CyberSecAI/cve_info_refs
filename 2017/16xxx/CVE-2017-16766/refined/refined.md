- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in the `synodsmnotify` component of Synology DSM. Specifically, the `-fn` option of the `synodsmnotify` utility does not properly sanitize input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, specifically lack of input sanitization which leads to HTML/web script injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local users can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other forms of malicious code execution within the DSM interface. This could enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or data, or to compromise the system further.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by local users who have access to the DSM system, by injecting malicious web script or HTML via the `-fn` option of `synodsmnotify`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local user access to the DSM system. They must be able to execute the `synodsmnotify` command with crafted arguments using the `-fn` option.
