The provided content relates to CVE-2017-16303.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `strcpy` to copy data from a JSON object into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper length validation. This occurs within the PubNub message handler for the "cc" channel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is a classic stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The `strcpy` function is used to copy the string values from the JSON message, without checking the length of the source, leading to buffer overflows when the source is larger than the destination buffer.

Specifically, the vulnerability is located when handling the "sn_ex" command. The value associated with the `cmd2` key within a JSON message is copied using `strcpy` into a buffer allocated on the stack. This buffer has a size of 16 bytes. Sending a string value longer than 16 bytes for `cmd2` will cause the buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary data on the stack. This includes control data such as saved registers, saved return address, and saved frame pointer. The overwrite can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted JSON message sent via the PubNub service. An attacker must send an authenticated HTTP request to the PubNub service, embedding the malicious JSON payload within the URL path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires the following:
1.  Knowledge of the device's PubNub publish and subscribe keys.
2.  Knowledge of the device's Insteon ID (lower 3 octets of MAC address).
3. A valid 16-byte hex-encoded authentication key.
4. The ability to send HTTP GET requests.
5. The attacker must be able to send the crafted HTTP request to the Insteon Hub device.
