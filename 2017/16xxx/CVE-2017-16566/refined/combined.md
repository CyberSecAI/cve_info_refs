### Jooan A5 2.3.36 FTP vulnerability - Full Device Compromise

### CVE

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16566>

### Disclosure Timeline

CERT Contact **July 27, 2017**

Vendor Contact(No response) **July 31, 2017**

CVE Requested **November 3, 2017**

Public Disclosure **November 17, 2017**

### Vendor

[Shenzhen Jooan Technology Co](http://www.qacctv.com)

### Product

Jooan A5 IP Camera

### Versions Affected

2.3.36

### Risk / Severity Rating

9.8 ***CRITICAL***

### CVSS Vector String

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Vulnerability Description and Impact

The Jooan IP Camera has port 21 open by default on which it exposes a FTP server. This server asks for credentials but is not configured to deny access if not supplied. The connected user is provided with root access. This level of privilege allows for exfiltration of the entire local file system including the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files as well as recorded video and audio files. Furthermore,
an attacker is able to edit and push an altered version of the password file, which includes an injected user account, to the device allowing for root access via telnet. Successful exploitation will result in persistent root level remote access to the device.

### Caveats / Prerequisites

This attack can be executed remotely and can be performed without any authentication.

### Proof of Concept

[![Watch the PoC on Youtube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8L-4geKXm2A/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L-4geKXm2A)

### Additional notes

We have demonstrated post-exploitation activities that consist of, but are not limited to:

* Unauthenticated access to the capabilities provided by Realtime streaming protocol (rstp)
* Recording/power status-lights can be easily toggled with custom scripts located on the device e.g. `led.sh`
* Modify system files to allow backdoors to persist through system-resets.

### Solution

No response from the vendor at this time.

Rooting and disabling services to remove this vector may significantly affect the useablility of this product.
