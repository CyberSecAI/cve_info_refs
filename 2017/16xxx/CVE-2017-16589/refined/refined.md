    "status": "relevant",
    "cve": "CVE-2017-16589",
    "summary": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the yTsiz member of SIZ markers. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing the yTsiz member of SIZ markers in JPEG2000 images. This results in an out-of-bounds read.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read",
        "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could leverage the out-of-bounds read to potentially gain sensitive information from the application's memory or, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, execute code in the context of the current process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious PDF file",
        "Malicious Web page"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or a web page that triggers the vulnerability. The target user needs to open the malicious PDF or visit the malicious webpage."
