Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16828:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the `display_debug_frames` function within `dwarf.c`.
*   The vulnerability occurs when processing corrupted ELF files with a large augmentation data length.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `augmentation_data_len` variable is added to a pointer `start`. If `augmentation_data_len` is sufficiently large, this can lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a small value for `start` that precedes the base address, allowing access beyond allocated memory.
*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The integer overflow leads to a heap-buffer-overflow when the code tries to read data using the potentially corrupted `start` pointer.
*   **Lack of proper bounds checking:** The original code only checks if start >= end and if augmentation_data_len is negative. However, it does not check for the overflow of start.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash, causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Potential Unspecified Impacts:** The Gentoo advisory mentions "other unspecified impacts" are possible.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious ELF file:** An attacker can craft a malicious ELF file with a corrupted augmentation data length.
*   **Command-line tool:** When a vulnerable tool like `readelf` parses the crafted ELF file, the integer overflow occurs, leading to the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide crafted ELF file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ELF file to a user who will then use a vulnerable version of binutils on it. The user does not necessarily have to be local to the attacker.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is in the `display_debug_frames` function within the `dwarf.c` file of the binutils package.
*   The provided ASAN output shows the exact location of the heap-buffer-overflow.
*   The bug report includes a POC (Proof of Concept) file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding additional checks for integer overflow in the calculation of the `start` variable and by using `bfd_size_type` for `augmentation_data_len`.
*   The fix involves a new function called `display_augmentation_data` and also addresses a problem of reading a 64-bit LEB128-encoded value into a 32-bit variable.
*   The Gentoo security advisory indicates that versions of binutils prior to 2.30-r2 are vulnerable.
