# HTCONDOR-2017-0001

---

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| A user can cause the condor\_schedd to crash by submitting a job designed for that purpose. [CVE-2017-16816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16816) | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | condor\_schedd | All before 8.6.8 (stable) and 8.7.5 (devel) | all | not known to be publicly exploited | 8.6.8, 8.7.5 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | authorized HTCondor submitter | any host | low | medium | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2017-11-14 | Edgar M Fajardo HernandezBrian BocklemanJaime Frey | | |
| Access Required: | authorized HTCondor submitter |
| This vulnerability requires the attacker to be able to submit a job to a condor\_schedd. | |
| Effort Required: | low |
| Using standard HTCondor binaries, an attacker with knowledge of the nature of this vulnerability and manipulating GSI proxies can cause a denial of service. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | medium |
| Using a specially crafted proxy, an attacker can cause the condor\_schedd to crash, essentially preventing any users from running jobs. | |
| Workaround: |
| If your site does not use GSI, or if it does use GSI but does not utilize VOMS extensions, you can set "`USE_VOMS_ATTRIBUTES = False`" in your configuration to avoid the issue entirely. | |
| Full Detials: | If a user submitted a job by authenticating with GSI, or that job carried a GSI certificate using the x509userproxy keyword, it was possible to crash the condor\_schedd. Adding VOMS attributes to the proxy, but then setting either the VONAME or FQAN attribute to certificate that would cause HTCondor daemons to crash. This creates a potential denial of service that would prevent all users of HTCondor from submitting jobs. |
