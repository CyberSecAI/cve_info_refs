- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied path within the `type` parameter of the `org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.reports.templates.misc.sample_jsp` servlet. This servlet listens on TCP port 8081 by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability allows for arbitrary file deletion. The authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can delete arbitrary files on the vulnerable system. This vulnerability, in combination with others, can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through a network request to the vulnerable servlet on TCP port 8081.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote unauthenticated attacker, though the advisory mentions that the authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
