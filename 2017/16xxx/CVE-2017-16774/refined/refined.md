- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `SYNO.Core.PersonalNotification.Event` component of Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote authenticated users can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This could lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `package` parameter. An attacker can inject malicious code through this parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user. The user interface is involved (UI:R), meaning the attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with the injected malicious code.
