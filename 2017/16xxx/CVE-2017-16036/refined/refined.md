The provided content is a GitHub repository page, specifically showing the directory structure of a project named "NPM-Vuln-PoC" and its subdirectory "directory-traversal/badjs-sourcemap-server". It includes files like "PoC.sh", "attack.js", and "test.js".

Based on the file names and directory path "directory-traversal", this content is likely related to directory traversal vulnerabilities.

However, this is just the file structure of a repository that seems to contain PoC's for vulns. It does not contain a vulnerability description, the root cause or any other vulnerability details.

Therefore, I will respond with:

NOINFO
