    "content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2017-16581.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of validation of the existence of an object prior to performing operations on it, specifically within the author attribute of the Document object in Foxit Reader.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-After-Free vulnerability.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.\n\nAttack vectors: The attack vector is through a malicious PDF file or webpage. User interaction is required, as the target user must open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious webpage.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or a webpage that exploits the Use-After-Free vulnerability, and then needs to convince the user to open the malicious PDF file or visit the malicious webpage. The attacker is not required to be local, therefore can be remote."
