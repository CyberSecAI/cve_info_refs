- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer binary, `vagrant-vmware-installer_darwin_amd64`, within the vagrant-vmware-fusion plugin is not owned by root.  This allows a local attacker to replace it with a malicious executable during the plugin installation process which runs with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper file ownership on the installer binary. While the plugin's installation process is executed with root privileges, the installer itself is not, enabling a replacement attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to local privilege escalation to root. This allows the attacker to gain full control over the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker. The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to write files in the user's home directory (`$HOME/.vagrant.d/gems/2.3.4/gems/vagrant-vmware-fusion-5.0.1/ext/vagrant-vmware-desktop/`) and must be able to trigger the plugin installation process which requires the `vagrant` command to be executed with elevated permissions.
