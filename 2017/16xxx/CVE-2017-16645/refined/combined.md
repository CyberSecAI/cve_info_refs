After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1016-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0-1016.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)
* [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0.1016.14](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

```
Before trying to use CDC union descriptor, try to validate whether that it
is sane by checking that intf->altsetting->extra is big enough and that
descriptor bLength is not too big and not too small.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1012-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.13.0-1012.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.13.0-1012.16)

* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)

  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

I've got the following report while fuzzing the kernel with syzkaller.

On commit dc972a67cc54585bd83ad811c4e9b6ab3dcd427e (4.14-rc2+).

There's no check that the length of intf->altsetting->extra is big

enough to hold usb\_cdc\_union\_desc struct.

Can you please tell me if the following works for you?

Thanks!

Input: ims-psu - check if CDC union descriptor is sane

From: Dmitry Torokhov <dmitry....@gmail.com>

Before trying to use CDC union descriptor, try to validate whether that it

is sane by checking that intf->altsetting->extra is big enough and that

descriptor bLength is not too big and not too small.

Hi Dmitry,

I don't have a reproducer for this issue, but the fix looks good to

me. I'll apply and keep testing.

Thanks!

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17806](/security/CVE-2017-17806))

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's

default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)

  -
  [4.13.0-38.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)

  -
  [4.13.0.38.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-38.43)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
