  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-16639",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The browser fails to block UNC paths from being loaded in the address bar, leading to a connection to an arbitrary SMB server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The browser does not prevent loading of UNC paths, which can trigger SMB connections.",
      "The browser does not prevent SMB connections bypassing proxy settings."
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure. Remote attackers can bypass anonymity features and discover a client's IP address.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker tricks the victim into pasting a malicious UNC path into the browser's address bar.",
       "An attacker can use CSS to make a UNC path partially hidden, so that a seemingly harmless URL, when copy-pasted, will include the malicious UNC path.",
        "An attacker can use CSS to shift the mouse cursor location, so that when a victim selects text with the mouse, it also selects the hidden malicious UNC path"

    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious SMB server and create a web page with the crafted UNC path. The attacker needs to convince the victim to copy/paste the crafted URL into the browser's address bar.",
    "affected_versions": "Tor Browser version < 8.0, Firefox version < 62 / < 60.2.0esr",
