### @alexmchardy **[alexmchardy](/alexmchardy)** commented [Oct 13, 2016](#issue-182886077)

I found that if I pass any `interpolation` options without including `escapeValue`, `this.escapeValue` will get set to `undefined` in `Interpolator`. The documentation indicates `escapeValue` defaults to `true`, so this could cause variables to not be escaped as expected in some cases.

This config, for example, will result in `i18next` not escaping variables as expected:

```
i18next.init({
  interpolation: {
    prefix: "__",
    suffix: "__"
  },
  ...
});

```

It's worth noting that it could potentially be a XSS security issue for users of `i18next` if they believe variables are getting escaped when they actually aren't.

Sorry, something went wrong.
