{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a regular expression to validate the callback URL, which can be bypassed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The regular expression `^${this.props.callbackUrl}[\\?#](.*)$` used to parse the callback URL is vulnerable to bypass. The `\` needs to be escaped as `\\` in regular expressions, therefore the expression should have been `^${this.props.callbackUrl}[\\?\\#](.*)$`. The unescaped backslash can allow an attacker to inject additional characters into the `callbackUrl` and consequently control the final redirect URL.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL that bypasses the validation check, allowing them to redirect the user to an arbitrary website after the authentication flow. This can lead to the exfiltration of access tokens or other sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the callback URL. An attacker can construct a malicious URL that includes a crafted redirect URI. When the application attempts to parse the callback URL using the vulnerable regex, the attacker's malicious URL will pass the validation and result in the user being redirected to an arbitrary site controlled by the attacker.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the construction of the callback URL. Typically, this could be achieved by a man-in-the-middle attack or by manipulating a link sent to the user. The attacker also needs to be aware of the usage of this vulnerable component."
