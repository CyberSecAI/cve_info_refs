The provided content is a GitHub page displaying the contents of a directory named `liyujing` within a repository called `NPM-Vuln-PoC`. The directory itself is within a larger `directory-traversal` directory. The files `PoC.sh`, `attack.js`, and `test.js` are listed within the `liyujing` directory.

Based on the file path and directory name, this content is very likely related to CVE-2017-16120, which is a directory traversal vulnerability. Although the specific vulnerability is not described in the provided content, the presence of these files and directory structure strongly indicates that the repository contains proof-of-concept code related to a directory traversal vulnerability. 

Given that the provided content does not describe the vulnerability itself, but links to the files where it would be contained, this can be classified as related to the CVE, but does not provide direct details for extraction.

Therefore, the response is:
