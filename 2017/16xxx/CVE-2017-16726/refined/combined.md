CVE-2017-16726, CVE-2019-16871

ADS is only advised to be used in protected environments, and as such does not provide security properties.
Attackers can eavesdrop, manipulate and forge arbitrary packets as in any other cleartext protocol. In case
ADS access is possible, various system related services can be used.

Appearance

  TwinCAT 2 / 3

Description

Beckhoff TwinCAT supports communication over ADS. ADS is a protocol for industrial automation in protected
environments [1].  ADS has not been designed to achieve security purposes and therefore does not include
any encryption algorithms because of their negative effect on performance and throughput.

  An attacker can forge arbirtrary ADS packets when legitimate ADS traffic is observable.

  An attacker, who has access via ADS could make use of various local services

Solution

Use ADS Protocol only in protected environments, where security measures are not required and no attack
is possible. In case all ADS applications are running on the same system, Beckhoff recommends to block
ADS via firewall.
In case of distributed applications, we recommend to make use of other protocols (e.g. ADS over IPSec,
ADS-over-MQTT, OPC-UA) or Secure ADS, which is available since TwinCAT 3.1 Build 4024.0. This could
be used to transfer ADS messages over an encrypted connection. Optionally, the non-encrypted ADS could
be disabled and uni-directional connections could be configured. It is still valid that who ever has access via
ADS could use various local services like described above.
