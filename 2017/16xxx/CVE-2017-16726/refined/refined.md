Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-16726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue is the design of the ADS (Automation Device Specification) protocol itself. It was not created with security in mind, prioritizing performance and throughput over confidentiality and integrity. It lacks encryption and proper authentication mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Communication:** ADS transmits data in cleartext, making it susceptible to eavesdropping.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The protocol does not have built-in authentication.
*   **Packet Forgery:** Attackers can forge arbitrary ADS packets, potentially manipulating device behavior.
*  **Local Service Exploitation**: Attackers with ADS access can use various system services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Eavesdropping:** Attackers can intercept and read sensitive data transmitted via ADS.
*   **Manipulation:** Attackers can alter the behavior of industrial devices by injecting forged ADS packets.
*   **System Compromise**: Attackers with access via ADS can use local system services which can result in a variety of impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** Attackers can intercept ADS traffic on the network if it is not properly segmented or firewalled.
*   **Direct Access:** Attackers with direct access to the ADS network or devices can manipulate ADS packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to observe legitimate ADS traffic. This requires network access to the ADS communications or the industrial devices using ADS.
*   **ADS Protocol Knowledge:** Understanding of the ADS protocol would be necessary to forge packets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory emphasizes that ADS is intended for use in protected environments.
*   It suggests using alternatives like ADS over IPSec, ADS-over-MQTT, OPC-UA, or Secure ADS for secure communication, especially in distributed systems.
*   The document also mentions disabling non-encrypted ADS and setting up unidirectional connections as a possible mitigation.
* The advisory mentions that an attacker with ADS access can use various local services which implies that the impact can extend beyond just manipulating the ADS packets themselves.
