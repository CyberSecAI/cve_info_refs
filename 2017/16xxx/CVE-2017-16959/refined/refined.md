{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization when handling the 'locale' option in the /etc/config/locale file via the `locale.lua` controller. Specifically, the controller function `set_sysinfo(formvals)` fails to handle the '%0d' character, which results in the deletion of the 'locale' option line. Subsequently, the `get_sysinfo(formvals)` function lacks proper checks when the 'locale' option is missing, relying on the `Accept-Language` header for language file verification, and uses `nixio.fs.stat` to check if the language file exists, including paths provided by the user via the header.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path Disclosure",
     "Improper input validation",
    "Improper sanitization",
     "Lack of authentication"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the path disclosure vulnerability to verify the existence of files and directories on the router's file system. This information can be used to further an attack, such as information gathering or arbitrary file access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/luci/locale` endpoint. First, to delete the locale option in the config file using a specially crafted locale value containing '%0d'. Second, crafted `Accept-Language` header to probe the existence of arbitrary files using the path. This is done by manipulating the Accept-Language header and triggering a file system stat call with the given path.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. No authentication is required, meaning the attack can be carried out remotely as long as the router's web interface is accessible."
