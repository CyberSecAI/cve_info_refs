The content is related to CVE-2017-16785.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `host.php` script, specifically within the URL path. The application fails to sanitize the URL path parameter before using it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data, or to redirect the user to a malicious website, potentially leading to further compromise or phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted URL. The attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking on a malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system, they only need to lure a victim to click on the specially crafted link. The attacker can be in a remote position.
