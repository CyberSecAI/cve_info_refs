**Vendor:** PHOENIX CONTACT

**Equipment:** FL COMSERVER, FL COM SERVER, and PSI-MODEM/ETH

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following models running firmware versions prior to 1.99, 2.20, or 2.40 of FL COMSERVER, FL COM SERVER, and PSI-MODEM/ETH, industrial networking equipment, are affected:

* FL COMSERVER BASIC 232/422/485,

* FL COM SERVER RS232,
* FL COM SERVER RS485, and
* PSI-MODEM/ETH.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to change configuration variables on the device.

## MITIGATION

PHOENIX CONTACT has released new firmware versions for the affected devices. The latest download links can be found at:

<https://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2017-004>

NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT web site](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

[(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.0)

#### Weakness

Cross-site Scripting [(CWE-79)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

#### Summary

A Cross-site Scripting issue was discovered in PHOENIX CONTACT FL COMSERVER BASIC 232/422/485, FL COMSERVER UNI 232/422/485, FL COMSERVER BAS 232/422/485-T, FL COMSERVER UNI 232/422/485-T, FL COM SERVER RS232, FL COM SERVER RS485, and PSI-MODEM/ETH (running firmware versions prior to 1.99, 2.20, or 2.40). The cross-site scripting vulnerability has been identified, which may allow remote code execution.

#### Details

[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16723)

---

#### Impact

On devices with older firmware versions, an unauthenticated user with network access is able to change (but not activate) the configuration variables by accessing a specific URL on the web server, without authenticating in the web interface first. A changed configuration can only be permanently saved and activated by an authenticated user. However, since the input is not properly sanitised, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code. When this code is executed on the client of an authenticated user, changed configuration variables could be saved and activated without user interaction.

#### Solution

PHOENIX CONTACT released new firmware versions for the affected devices, which fix this vulnerability. Customers using these devices in an unprotected network environment are recommended to update to firmware versions 1.99, 2.20, or 2.40, as listed below.
