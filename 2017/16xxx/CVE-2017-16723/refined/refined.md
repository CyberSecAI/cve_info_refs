Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The web interface of the affected Phoenix Contact devices does not properly sanitize user input when generating web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Configuration Modification:** An unauthenticated attacker can change configuration variables on the device by accessing a specific URL without logging in.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the browser of an authenticated user, enabling them to save and activate changed configurations without user interaction. This can lead to persistent changes in device behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a specific URL that injects malicious JavaScript code.
- **User Interaction (Indirect):** While an unauthenticated attacker can change config variables, the injected script needs to be executed in the context of a logged in user to save and activate them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
- **Low Skill Level:** According to the advisory, the exploitation is remotely exploitable and requires a low skill level.
- **No Authentication Initially:** The attacker can initially modify config variables without authenticating. However, authentication is needed indirectly via the user interaction vector for complete exploitation.
