Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The FiberHome LM53Q1 device uses SOAP-based web services for its portal interaction.
*   Improper permission handling on these web services allows unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access controls on the web services.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This unauthorized access allows retrieval of sensitive information, including:
    *   Connected devices.
    *   Portal username and password.
    *   Other device details like IMEI, SSID, and DNS settings.
*   **Password Modification:** An attacker can also change the administrator password through crafted web service calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Device Control:** By obtaining the administrator credentials, an attacker can gain full control of the device.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information about the device and its network is exposed.
*   **Network Manipulation:**  Attackers can modify device settings, potentially compromising connected devices' security or network functionality.
*   **Denial of Service:** Changing the password would deny legitimate users access to the device configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device to access the web services. This could mean being connected to the device's Wi-Fi, or having access to the LAN it's connected to.
*   **SOAP-based Web Service Interaction:** The attack is performed by sending crafted requests to the device's web services. The provided exploit code shows example requests targeting the `/xml_action.cgi` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*   **HTTP request capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's IP address.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP:** Although the exploit code automates most of the process, some understanding of HTTP requests and XML responses might be needed for further exploitation or modification.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code is a Python script that automates the process of retrieving credentials, device information, and changing the administrator password using the vulnerabilities
*   The device is a FiberHome MIFI LM53Q1, specifically version VH519R05C01S38.
*   The vulnerabilities are identified as CVE-2017-16885, CVE-2017-16886, and CVE-2017-16887 (this analysis focuses on the broader context provided in the description which covers all 3 CVEs).
