## Description

[![@sophiebits](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6820?u=097c740794fbd764471079b9271823f6acceca13&v=4&size=48)](/sophiebits)[sophiebits](https://github.com/sophiebits)opened [on Aug 20, 2016](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable/issues/227#issue-172281214)

If you render the markdown

```
[xss](data:text/html,<script>alert(document.domain)</script>)

```

using remarkable in Firefox, clicking it will run a script on the domain of the page displaying the rendered markup (test on <http://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/>), which can be a security issue.

Do you think we could change the protocol blacklist to instead be a whitelist and only include some of the most common protocols? I realize it's already customizable by overriding `validateLink` but a more secure default would be nice.

If that's too big of a change, "data:" should at least be filtered out in addition to javascript: and vbscript:.
