The provided content discusses a security issue in the `remarkable` markdown library related to data URLs, specifically in issue #227. This vulnerability is relevant to CVE-2017-16006.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Root Cause:** The `remarkable` library, by default, allows `data:` URLs which can be exploited to inject malicious scripts. Specifically, a markdown link using `data:text/html,<script>...</script>` can execute JavaScript in the context of the page displaying the rendered markdown.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Inadequate sanitization of URLs: The library's default behavior does not block data URLs, which allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript.
    *   Protocol blacklist approach: The original issue suggests that the library's use of a blacklist for protocols is less secure than a whitelist, which would provide a more secure default.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when they click on a specially crafted markdown link using a `data:` URL. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious Markdown: An attacker can inject malicious markdown containing `data:` URLs into any content that is processed by the vulnerable version of `remarkable`. This could occur on a web page or application that displays user-provided markdown using this library.
    *   User Interaction: The user would need to click the crafted link to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to Inject Markdown: The attacker needs to be able to inject or influence the markdown that will be processed by the `remarkable` library. This could be through user-submitted content on a website, a malicious document using markdown, etc.
    *   User Interaction: The user must click on the rendered link containing the malicious `data:` URL.

The issue suggests that while `validateLink` can be overridden, the default should be more secure by using a whitelist or, at the very least, filtering out `data:` URLs.
