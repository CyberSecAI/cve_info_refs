{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Ulterius Server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file requests, allowing directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
       "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem that reside on the same drive as the Ulterius server. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information or potentially allow further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending specially crafted HTTP requests with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the file path, an attacker can navigate outside of the intended directory and access files elsewhere on the system.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Ulterius server. They do not need to be authenticated."
