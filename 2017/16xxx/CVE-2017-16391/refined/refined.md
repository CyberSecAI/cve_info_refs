The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16391.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of array index.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from improper validation of an array index. This means that the software doesn't properly check if an index used to access an array is within the array's boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected system, gaining control of the system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly mentioned but is likely triggered via a malicious PDF file. An attacker could craft a PDF document that contains a specially crafted array index that, when processed by Adobe Acrobat or Reader, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to get a user to open a malicious PDF file. This could be done through email, malicious websites, or other file-sharing methods.
