- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "descrição" (description) field of service orders. Specifically, it does not prevent the storage of malicious JavaScript code within this field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the service order description. When an administrator views a client with such a service order, the injected JavaScript code executes in the administrator's browser. This allows the attacker to potentially perform actions such as:
  - Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
  - Redirecting the administrator to malicious sites.
  - Defacing the administrator's view of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must first register as a client in the system. They then create a service order and insert malicious javascript code into the description field. The attack is triggered when the administrator views the affected client which causes the injected code to be executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to register as a client and create service orders, which usually implies having a basic user account. The attacker also needs to know that administrators have the ability to view the service orders.
