{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `strcpy` function is used to copy data from the JSON message to a fixed-size stack buffer without any bounds checking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow",
    "Unbounded string copy"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution due to the ability to overwrite the stack, including saved registers and return addresses. This allows for full control over the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted JSON message through the PubNub service.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send authenticated HTTP requests to the PubNub API with a valid `auth-key`. This implies that the attacker already has access to the device's authentication details or is able to retrieve the key via another vulnerability. The attacker doesn't need to be on the local network."
