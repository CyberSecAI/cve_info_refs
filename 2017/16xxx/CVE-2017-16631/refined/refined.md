Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-16631

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the "Account Password Reset" functionality of SapphireIMS 4097_1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The system does not properly validate or authorize the user before allowing a password reset. A guest user can manipulate the request to reset the password of an administrative user.
- **Incorrect Permission Assignment:** The application fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing an unauthorized user to modify sensitive information (a user's password). This is explicitly mentioned as CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** A guest user can change the password of an administrative user, leading to a complete account takeover.
- **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** The attacker gains access to an administrative account, which could lead to further compromise of the system, data, or operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Web Application:** The attack is performed via the web application's password reset functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Guest User:** The attacker can be an unauthenticated user, i.e., a user that does not have any valid user credentials for the application and is considered a "guest" user.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the "Account Password Reset" functionality and how to manipulate the request.

**Additional Information:**

- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS 3.0 base score of 8.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) indicating a high severity.
- **Disclosure Timeline:** The vendor was informed multiple times without any response. The CVE was assigned on 06 Nov, 2017.
