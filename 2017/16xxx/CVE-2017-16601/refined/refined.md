- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to improper validation of a user-supplied path in the `filename` parameter of the `org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.reports.templates.service.service_005ffailures_jsp` servlet before using it in file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory Traversal, Arbitrary File Overwrite.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can overwrite arbitrary files accessible to the Administrator on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a malicious request to the vulnerable servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires authentication to exploit this vulnerability, but the authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
