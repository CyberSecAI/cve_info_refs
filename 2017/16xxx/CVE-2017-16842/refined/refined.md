{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-provided input within the `class-gsc-table.php` file of the Yoast SEO WordPress plugin.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "SQL Injection (potential)"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page by manipulating the 'paged', 'orderby' or 'order' parameters.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET parameter manipulation"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the HTTP GET parameters like 'paged', 'orderby', or 'order' to inject malicious scripts. This can happen if the user is tricked into clicking a malicious link, or if there's an vulnerability that allows an attacker to set these parameters on a user's browser."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content shows a code change that was made to address the vulnerability. The changes include using `filter_input()` function with `INPUT_GET` to retrieve the values of  'paged', 'orderby', and 'order' parameters and using `esc_attr` to sanitize the values before outputting them to the HTML. This helps to prevent XSS attacks by making sure user-supplied data is properly escaped. In some cases the tilde (~~) is used to indicate the removed code before the change was implemented."
