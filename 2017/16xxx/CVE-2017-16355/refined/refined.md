Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Passenger's feature that reads the content of a file named `REVISION` in the application's root directory. This content was intended to display custom application information in the `passenger-status --show=xml` output.
*   Passenger was modified in version 5.0.10 to allow non-root users to view `passenger-status` output.
*   The vulnerability arises because a malicious user with the ability to create files (or symlinks) in the application's root directory can create a symlink named `REVISION` pointing to any arbitrary file on the system.
*   When `passenger-status --show=xml` is executed, Passenger would follow the symlink and output the contents of the arbitrary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:**  The core weakness is that the application reads a file specified by a user-controlled symlink, allowing for unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Passenger does not validate or restrict the target of the `REVISION` file, which allows it to be a symlink to any file.
*   **Privilege Escalation (indirect):** While not a direct privilege escalation, this allows a non-root user to read files normally only accessible to root (due to Passenger running as root) when they have the ability to deploy an application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read the contents of any file on the server that the Passenger process has read access to. This could potentially include sensitive information such as configuration files, database credentials, private keys, or source code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where Passenger is running.
*   **Application Deployment Access:** The attacker needs the ability to deploy an application to Passenger and create symlinks within the application's root directory.
*   **`passenger-status --show=xml` access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the command `passenger-status --show=xml` or have access to the output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **System Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the server.
*   **Non-root User:** The attacker does not need to be a root user.
*   **Application Deployment:** Must be able to deploy an application and manipulate files in application root directory.
*   **`passenger-status` access:** Must be able to view the output of `passenger-status --show=xml`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Passenger versions 5.0.10 and higher when running as root, using Nginx or Apache integration mode.
*   The fix involved removing the reading of the `REVISION` file in Passenger versions 5.1.10 (Enterprise) and 5.1.11 (Open Source).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by the cPanel Security Team.
*   A Debian Security Advisory (DSA-4415-1) was released regarding this vulnerability, fixing the issue in version 5.0.30-1+deb9u1 for Debian Stretch.
*   The fix was implemented by disabling the code responsible for reading the revision file, as shown in the provided GitHub commit.
