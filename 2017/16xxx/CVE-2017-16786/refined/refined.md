The provided content mentions CVE-2017-16786 but the description refers to CVE-2017-16787.  The content describes an arbitrary file read vulnerability in Meinberg LANTIME Web Configuration Utility.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

-   The vulnerability is present in the Meinberg LANTIME Web Configuration Utility due to two flaws:
    -  First instance: The `ntpclientcounterlogfile` parameter in `/cgi-bin/mainv2` allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path, which is then read by the application.
    - Second instance: The firmware update functionality accepts the "file" schema in curl, enabling an attacker to download any file from the filesystem.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Arbitrary File Read:** The application allows an attacker to read any file on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   An attacker can read any file on the system with root permissions. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, passwords, or other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **First instance:** By crafting a malicious URL containing the `ntpclientcounterlogfile` parameter with an arbitrary file path.
    -  Example: `<https://host/cgi-bin/mainv2?value=800&showntpclientipinfo=>xxx&ntpclientcounterlogfile=/etc/passwd&lcs=xxx>`
-   **Second instance:** By exploiting the firmware update functionality with the "file" schema to download arbitrary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **First instance:** An attacker needs to have "Info-User" access to exploit the first instance.
-   **Second instance:** An attacker needs "Admin-User" access to exploit the second instance.
-   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
