Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the pull request #464:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unsafe handling of row labels in the hover tooltip of the morris.js library. Specifically, the code was concatenating the row label directly into the HTML of the tooltip without proper sanitization. This could allow malicious content within a label to be interpreted as code, leading to XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By including malicious JavaScript within a row label, an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the browser of a user viewing the chart.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could perform malicious actions such as:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to phishing pages.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page displayed to the user.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the row label data itself. If an attacker can control the data used for the labels in the chart, they can insert malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject or manipulate the row label data, which is displayed by the morris.js library when the user hovers over the chart.

**Additional notes:**

* The pull request #464 "Escape labels in hover" was created to address this vulnerability by preventing XSS attacks.
* The solution implemented is to escape the row label values before using them in the tooltip. This prevents malicious code from being interpreted as HTML.
* The vulnerability was initially reported and addressed in a fork of the project.
