Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `TargetEntity` parameter. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input containing HTML tags, which are then directly embedded into the HTML response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The application is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is evident from the generated HTML, where the injected script `&lt;script&gt;alert(&apos;bla-bla-bla&apos;);&lt;/script&gt;` is included verbatim within the error message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the response, which will then be executed within the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL. This could allow the attacker to:
* Steal cookies and session tokens.
* Redirect users to malicious websites.
* Modify the content of the page.
* Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that contains the malicious script in the `TargetEntity` parameter. This URL would then need to be sent to the victim, likely through social engineering or by other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious script and persuade the victim to visit this URL. No special network position or access is required, only the ability to send a link to the target.
