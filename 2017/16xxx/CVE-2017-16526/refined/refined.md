{
  "CVE-2017-16526": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The UWB driver in the Linux kernel did not properly check for an error condition, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.",
    "root_cause": "The Ultra Wide Band (UWB) driver in the Linux kernel may dereference an invalid pointer in an error case.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash) or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A physically proximate attacker could trigger the error condition by providing malicious input or by manipulating the UWB hardware.",
      "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the target system and ability to interact with the UWB hardware."
