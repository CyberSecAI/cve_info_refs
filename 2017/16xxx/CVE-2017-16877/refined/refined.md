Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue within the `/_next` and `/static` request namespaces. This was due to insufficient validation of user-supplied paths when serving static files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to traverse the file system by crafting a malicious request with `..` sequences. The server did not correctly sanitize or validate the requested paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information in the file system that was not intended to be publicly accessible. This could include application source code, configuration files, or other sensitive data.
- The severity of this issue is reduced in container-based deployments, `chroot` environments, and virtualized users, as the attacker's access would likely be restricted to frontend JavaScript components.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out by crafting HTTP requests to the server that include directory traversal sequences in the URL path (e.g., `/_next/../../../../etc/passwd`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Directory Structure:**  Knowledge of the server's file structure makes exploitation more effective, but an attacker can also perform brute-force techniques to discover sensitive files.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affected all users of Next.js prior to the release of versions `2.4.1` and `3.0.0-beta7`.
- Deployments on Zeit's `now.sh` and static deployments using `next export` were not affected.
- The fix involved implementing checks to prevent directory traversal.
- The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed by  `@ru_raz0r`.
-  The project is working with a security firm to conduct regular audits to prevent similar issues in the future.
-  The vulnerability fix was released as a patch and is recommended for all users.
