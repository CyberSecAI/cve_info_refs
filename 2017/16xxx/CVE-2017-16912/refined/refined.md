Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the relevant information pertaining to CVE-2017-16912:

**CVE-2017-16912**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The USB over IP implementation in the Linux kernel did not validate endpoint numbers. Specifically, the `get_pipe()` routine didn't validate the input endpoint number before using it to index `ep_in` and `ep_out` arrays.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code directly used an externally provided endpoint number without verifying if it was within the valid range for the `ep_in` and `ep_out` arrays.
    *   **Potential for Out-of-Bounds Access**: Using an invalid endpoint number could lead to out-of-bounds access on the `ep_in` and `ep_out` arrays.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Denial of Service (System Crash)**: A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a kernel crash by sending a crafted USB over IP command.

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker who can connect to a USB over IP server.
    *   **Network Access**: The attacker requires network access to the system running the vulnerable USB/IP server.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker must be able to send malicious USB/IP messages to a vulnerable system.
    *   No special privileges are needed on the targeted system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involves adding a range check on the endpoint number in the `get_pipe()` function.
*   The `stub_recv_cmd_submit()` function is modified to handle the new error return from `get_pipe()`.
*   The provided patches resolve the vulnerability, preventing the out-of-bounds access.

In summary, CVE-2017-16912 is an exploitable vulnerability due to a lack of proper input validation on endpoint numbers in the USB over IP implementation. This can lead to a remote denial-of-service attack. The patches mitigate this issue by adding bounds checks and adjusting related functions for appropriate error handling.
