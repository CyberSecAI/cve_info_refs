# Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in online reader! #1609

## Description

[![@bkimminich](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3531020?u=3580bf96e804a253ccfffafda381453e55b3f542&v=4&size=48)](/bkimminich)[bkimminich](https://github.com/bkimminich)opened [on Nov 25, 2016](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/issues/1609#issue-191767482)

I accidentally discovered that the online reader of GitBook is vulnerable to [Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29). If HTML or Javascript code is not put in backticks to mark it as a code block (e.g. `https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)`) it will actually be executed.

This is a severe security issue and should be addressed immediately. I added a harmless Javascript `alert` script to a page in my book for you to verify the issue: <https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part2/xss.html>

> Disclaimer: I have reported this issue some weeks before via email and Slack but neither received a response nor was the issue fixed silently.
