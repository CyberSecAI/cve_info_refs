The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16893.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `admin/tags.php` file. Specifically, the `$_POST['edit_list']` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability is present due to the lack of input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `edit_list` parameter, potentially leading to:
    - Unauthorized data access and retrieval.
    - Modification or deletion of data.
    - Full database compromise in worst-case scenarios.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user can craft a request to `admin/tags.php` with a crafted value for the `edit_list` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable admin page and send a POST request with the malicious parameter value.
