This GitHub page shows the directory structure of a repository named `NPM-Vuln-PoC` which contains a directory named `directory-traversal` and a subdirectory named `serverlyr`. The presence of the directory name `directory-traversal` and files like `PoC.sh`, `attack.js` and `test.js` strongly suggests this repo contains code related to directory traversal vulnerabilities. While the specific code for the vulnerability is not shown here, this confirms that the content relates to directory traversal, a common vulnerability, which may be associated with CVE-2017-16089.

Based on the file names, we can infer the following:

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Directory traversal vulnerability. The "directory-traversal" folder name and files like `attack.js` and `PoC.sh` indicate this.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability in the `serverlyr` application, an attacker can access files or directories outside the intended location on the server.
*   **Impact:** Reading of arbitrary files and directories on the server, which can expose sensitive data, application source code, or other confidential information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker would need the ability to send malicious requests to the application in order to trigger the directory traversal vulnerability. This may be achieved through an HTTP request.

**Additional notes:**

*   The `PoC.sh` suggests a proof-of-concept script for demonstrating the vulnerability.
*  The `attack.js` is likely used to exploit the vulnerability and `test.js` likely contains tests for the application.
