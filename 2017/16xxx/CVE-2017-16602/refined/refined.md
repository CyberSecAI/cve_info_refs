{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists because the `org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.tools.exec_jsp` servlet does not properly validate a user-supplied string from the `command` parameter before using it to execute a system call.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability in the `tools.exec_jsp` servlet.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager server under the context of Administrator.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the `command` parameter of the `tools.exec_jsp` servlet. Although authentication is required, the existing mechanism can be bypassed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send requests to TCP port 8081 where the vulnerable servlet is listening. Although authentication is required, it can be bypassed. "
