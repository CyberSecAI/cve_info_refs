Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-16931:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how `libxml2` handles parameter-entity references within DTD (Document Type Definition) names. Specifically, the `NEXTL` macro, used during parsing, was incorrectly calling the `xmlParserHandlePEReference` function when encountering a '%' character within a DTD name. This could lead to unexpected entity expansion and changes to the input buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Parameter Entity Handling:** The core issue is the inappropriate triggering of entity expansion within DTD names, which are not meant to contain such references.
- **Input Buffer Manipulation:**  The unexpected expansion of parameter entities could lead to changes in the input buffer during parsing. This is problematic because the parser relies on the buffer remaining consistent while parsing.
- **Invalid Pointer Usage:** Due to the change in the input buffer, the function `xmlDictLookup` could be called with an invalid pointer, leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The changes to the input buffer and the potential use of an invalid pointer in `xmlDictLookup` could lead to a crash of applications that use `libxml2`, effectively causing a denial-of-service.
- **Undefined Behavior:** The use of an invalid pointer is a critical memory safety issue that could result in arbitrary code execution, but this is not explicitly stated as a direct impact in the provided information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious XML Documents:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious XML document that includes a DTD with a parameter entity reference in a name definition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide XML Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted XML input to an application that utilizes the vulnerable version of `libxml2`.

**Technical Details:**

- The problematic behavior occurred specifically within the `xmlParseNameComplex`, `xmlParseNCNameComplex`, and `xmlParseNmtoken` functions when parsing DTDs.
- The fix involved removing the call to `xmlParserHandlePEReference` from the `NEXTL` macro within these functions, as parameter entity expansion is not expected during parsing of names and tokens.
- A check was added to `xmlParseNameComplex` to validate the buffer size which mitigates the problem of `xmlDictLookup` being called with invalid pointers.
- The issue can be triggered with an internal subset and double entity expansion, indicating a level of complexity in how it can be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit also addresses CVE-2017-9049 and CVE-2017-9050 which are related to buffer handling when using the XML_PARSE_OLD10 option.
- This commit fixes a reported bug (766956) that was identified by multiple researchers using different methods.
- The `libxml2` version affected is prior to 2.9.5.
- The Debian security advisory indicates that the issue affects Debian 7 "Wheezy" which was fixed in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy11
