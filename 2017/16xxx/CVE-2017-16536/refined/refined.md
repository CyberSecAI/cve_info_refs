Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16536:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Conexant cx231xx USB video capture driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate interface descriptors during device probing. Specifically, it dereferenced a pointer to an Interface Association Descriptor (IAD) without checking if the device actually had an IAD, leading to a null pointer dereference if no IAD is present.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The code attempts to access the `bFirstInterface` member of an IAD structure through a pointer (`assoc_desc`) that might be NULL if the device doesn't have an IAD, causing a crash.
- **Insufficient validation:** The driver lacks proper validation of the presence of an Interface Association Descriptor before attempting to access its members.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (system crash):** A physically proximate attacker can trigger a kernel crash by plugging in a specially crafted USB device that lacks the expected Interface Association Descriptor, causing the kernel to dereference a NULL pointer.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Physically proximate attacker:** The attacker needs physical access to the target system to plug in a malicious USB device.
- **Malicious USB device:** The attacker must use a USB device that lacks the Interface Association Descriptor, triggering the NULL pointer dereference when the kernel probes the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the target system.
- Ability to create/modify a malicious USB device that does not conform to the expected structure.
- No special privileges required.
