Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-16630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the local user creation function of SapphireIMS version 4097\_1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The system allows a guest user to manipulate object references directly, enabling them to perform actions on resources they should not have access to.
*   **Incorrect Permission Assignment:**  A guest user, who should not have administrative privileges, is able to create a local administrator account on systems with SapphireIMS installed. This indicates a failure to properly enforce access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Elevation:** A guest user can elevate their privileges by creating a local administrator account on the target system.
*   **System Takeover:** Gaining local administrator access effectively grants the attacker full control over the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack can be carried out remotely, as indicated by the CVSS vector component "AV:N".
*   **Web application:** The vulnerability is present in the web application component of SapphireIMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege:** The attacker needs to have low privileges such as being a guest user in SapphireIMS.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack can be done without any user interaction as indicated by "UI:N".

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects SapphireIMS version 4097_1.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tanoy Bose.
*   The vendor was unresponsive to the vulnerability report.

**CVSS Score:**
*   8.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

This score indicates a high severity vulnerability due to the ease of exploitation and the impact on confidentiality and integrity.
