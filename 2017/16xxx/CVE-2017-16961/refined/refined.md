Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `temp_tags` parameter within the `core/inc/auto-modules.php` file, specifically within the `getPendingItem` function. This function retrieves tag IDs from the database, and uses these unsanitized values directly in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code directly includes unsanitized values from the `temp_tags` array in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `temp_tags` parameter before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting SQL queries designed to retrieve data. The provided PoC demonstrates this by extracting the database name.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on database permissions, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data, and in severe cases, gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1. **Initial Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `bigtree_tags` table via the `_tags[]` parameter when adding a new "tree" entry.
2. **Triggering the Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is then triggered by making a request to `admin/ajax/dashboard/approve-change` with the ID of a modified item. The `getPendingItem` function within `auto-modules.php` is called to retrieve the changes to that item and its related tags, which includes the malicious SQL payload.
3. **SQL Execution:** The unsanitized tag ID is directly included in the SQL query within `getPendingItem`, executing the attacker's injected SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with the ability to add "trees" to the BigTree CMS.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the `admin/ajax/dashboard/approve-change` endpoint.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious SQL Payload:** The attacker must have the skills to craft a suitable SQL injection payload that will achieve their objectives.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates how an attacker can inject malicious SQL code, and trigger the SQL injection to exfiltrate the database name.
- The code excerpts provided are helpful in understanding the vulnerability.
