Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `DefaultAuthenticationSuccessHandler` and `DefaultAuthenticationFailureHandler` in the Symfony Security component generate redirect responses using the `_target_path` parameter without proper validation. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL, including external domains, as the redirect target.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Open Redirect: The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external website.
- Lack of Input Validation: The application does not validate the `_target_path` parameter before generating a redirect response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Phishing Attacks: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to redirect users to a malicious site disguised as a legitimate one, enabling phishing attacks.
- User Manipulation: Attackers can use the vulnerability to manipulate user behavior, redirecting users to unwanted websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `_target_path` parameter is supplied as part of the request (e.g., a URL parameter).
- The attacker supplies a crafted URL as the `_target_path` value, which can be an absolute URL to an external domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the `_target_path` parameter (e.g. via URL parameters).
- No special privileges or access to the server is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented a check to ensure the redirect target is within the scope of the session cookie, matching the `cookie_domain` and `cookie_secure` configuration options.
- The vulnerability affects Symfony versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.37, 2.8.0 to 2.8.30, 3.2.0 to 3.2.13, and 3.3.0 to 3.3.12.
- Fixed in versions 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5, and 4.0-BETA5.
