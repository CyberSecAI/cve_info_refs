  "description": "The Swift object store and proxy server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved from the Swauth middleware authentication mechanism to a log file as part of a GET URI. This allows attackers to bypass authentication by inserting a token into an X-Auth-Token header of a new request.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The swauth middleware was logging authentication tokens in cleartext within the Swift object/proxy server logs. Specifically, the token was being included in the GET URI.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext storage of sensitive information (authentication tokens) in server logs",
        "Insufficient protection of authentication credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the Swift object/proxy server logs can obtain valid authentication tokens, bypassing the swauth authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to user data in Swift store.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Access to the Swift object/proxy server logs.",
        "Inserting a stolen token into an X-Auth-Token header."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "Attacker requires access to the logs of the Swift object and proxy servers. They also need the ability to send HTTP requests with arbitrary headers.",
