Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-16807:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied SVG documents uploaded as content files within the Kirby CMS panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user who accesses the malicious SVG file. This could lead to session hijacking, account compromise, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  An attacker with editor-level access uploads a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code to the Kirby CMS.
2.  A user (e.g., an administrator) accesses the uploaded SVG file within the CMS panel.
3.  The malicious JavaScript within the SVG file executes within the administrator's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise their session or perform unauthorized actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have at least editor-level access to the Kirby CMS to upload the malicious SVG file.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Kirby CMS versions prior to 2.3.3, 2.4.x before 2.4.2, and 2.5.x before 2.5.7.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Kirby CMS version 2.5.7.
*   The exploit requires the attacker to upload a specially crafted SVG document that includes malicious JavaScript.
*   The attack is triggered when a user (such as an administrator) views the uploaded SVG document within the Kirby CMS panel.
