## Description

[![@JacksonGL](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4462454?u=f330df976bb50b433a4c1b9c87436c4a588f3ca3&v=4&size=48)](/JacksonGL)[JacksonGL](https://github.com/JacksonGL)opened [on Apr 18, 2017](https://github.com/shy2850/node-server/issues/10#issue-222267997)

First of all, this is an awesome package with lots of functionalities.

It just has a directory traversal issue, which can be fixed by adding some filtering on the requested url path. To exploit the vulnerability, I can just send a web request say: `http://localhost:80/../../../` to browse and retrieve any file on the hosting server.

Notice: the above url does not work with `wget` or a browser. Try it by using `http.get` in a Node.js program.
