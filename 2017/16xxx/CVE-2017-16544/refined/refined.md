{
  "CVE-2017-16544": {
    "description": "In the add_match function in libbb/lineedit.c in BusyBox, the tab autocomplete feature of the shell, used to get a list of filenames in a directory, does not sanitize filenames and results in executing any escape sequence in the terminal. This could potentially result in code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks.",
    "root_cause": "The tab autocompletion feature in BusyBox's shell does not sanitize filenames, allowing escape sequences within filenames to be executed in the terminal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Command injection via escape sequences"
    ],
    "impact": "Code execution, arbitrary file writes, or other attacks via terminal escape sequences.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user interaction with the shell tab completion feature.",
      "Creation of a file with malicious escape sequences in the filename."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access with the ability to create files and interact with the BusyBox shell."
  }
