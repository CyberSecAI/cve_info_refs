{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `strcpy` function is used to copy data from a JSON message to a fixed-size buffer on the stack without any bounds checking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to unbounded string copy using `strcpy`",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by overwriting stack contents such as saved registers and the return address, leading to full control over the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted JSON messages to the 'cc' channel via the PubNub service.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to authenticate with the Insteon Hub using the PubNub API and send a crafted JSON message to the 'cc' channel."
