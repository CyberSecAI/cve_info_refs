The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16116.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the use of vulnerable regular expressions in the `underscore` and `unescapeHTML` methods of the `string.js` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The regular expressions `([A-Z\d]+)([A-Z][a-z])/g` and `/\&([^;]+);/g` are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). These regexes can cause excessive backtracking when matching against crafted malicious input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted input string that will cause the vulnerable regular expressions to take an excessive amount of time to process. This can potentially lead to the application or service becoming unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the input string provided to the `underscore` and `unescapeHTML` methods. An attacker can exploit this by providing a long string with specific patterns that maximize the backtracking of the vulnerable regular expressions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to influence the input to the `underscore` and `unescapeHTML` methods. The attacker does not need privileged access.
