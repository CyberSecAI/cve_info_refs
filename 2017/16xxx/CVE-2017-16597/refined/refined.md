- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of a user-supplied path within the Filename field during the processing of WRQ (Write Request) requests by the TFTP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A directory traversal vulnerability is present due to the lack of proper validation of the user-supplied path, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of Administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network. It does not require authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted WRQ requests to the vulnerable TFTP server.
