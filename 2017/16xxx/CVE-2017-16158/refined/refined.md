The provided content is a directory listing of a GitHub repository, specifically the `tiny-http` directory within a larger project named `NPM-Vuln-PoC`. While the file names (like `PoC.sh`, `attack.js`, and `test.js`) suggest the presence of a proof-of-concept for a vulnerability, the content itself doesn't describe the vulnerability. The repository name and the directory path "directory-traversal" also strongly indicate that the vulnerability is related to directory traversal. This information is useful for context but doesn't provide the details of the vulnerability, its root cause, or the method of exploitation.

Therefore, based solely on this content, it's impossible to provide specific vulnerability details.
