```
- Fixed a reflected XSS in the sharing group editor that requires malicious organisation names

- Low impact due to the following requirements:
  - organisation names with malicious org names (JS in the orgname)
  - sharing group editor user has to manually add an organisation to the list that has javascript in the org name
  - only vulnerable view is the editor itself, so the impact is limited to
    users that manually add organisations with malicious names to the list themselves / edit such sharing groups

- As reported by Dawid Czarnecki
```
