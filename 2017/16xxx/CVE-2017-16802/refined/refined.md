  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application was vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper handling of organisation names within the sharing group editor.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected XSS vulnerability in the sharing group editor.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to create or modify an organisation name with malicious JavaScript code and then have a user manually add it to a sharing group. The XSS is triggered when the sharing group editor is viewed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create organisations with malicious names and the target user needs to manually add such organization in the sharing group editor."
