CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11732 CVE-2017-16883 CVE-2017-16898

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ming:

CVE-2017-11732

    heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function dcputs
    (util/decompile.c) in Ming <= 0.4.8, which allows attackers to
    cause a denial of service via a crafted SWF file.

CVE-2017-16883

    NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the function outputSWF_TEXT_RECORD
    (util/outputscript.c) in Ming <= 0.4.8, which allows attackers
    to cause a denial of service via a crafted SWF file.

CVE-2017-16898

    global buffer overflow vulnerability in the function printMP3Headers
    (util/listmp3.c) in Ming <= 0.4.8, which allows attackers to cause a
    denial of service via a crafted SWF file.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1:0.4.4-1.1+deb7u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your ming packages.
