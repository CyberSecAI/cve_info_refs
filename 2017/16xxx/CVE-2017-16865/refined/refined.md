- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Trello importer in Atlassian Jira does not properly validate URLs, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious URL to an internal resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access the content of internal network resources. In environments like Amazon EC2, this could expose metadata resources containing access credentials and other confidential information.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit the Trello importer by providing a malicious URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Trello importer functionality in Jira.
