## Description

[![@yeahx](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11347901?u=2b362b290644d4c2ce3c294e173d4216571350e7&v=4&size=48)](/yeahx)[yeahx](https://github.com/yeahx)opened [on Apr 13, 2017](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/633#issue-221641862)

File `sanic/sanic/static.py` line 46

we can see here is security check

```
43    async def _handler(request, file_uri=None):
44        # Using this to determine if the URL is trying to break out of the path
45        # served.  os.path.realpath seems to be very slow
46        if file_uri and '../' in file_uri:
47            raise InvalidUsage("Invalid URL")

```

but at the line 56 in this file,the unquote function decoded file\_path

`file_path = unquote(file_path)`

we only need to "/" url coding can bypass the previous security check

like this:

example of vulnerabilities:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
#-*- coding:utf-8 -*-
#author: lazyago@gmail.com
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import text

app = Sanic()

app.static('/static', '/var/tmp')

@app.route("/")
async def test(request):
    return text('Hello!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8787, debug=True)

```
