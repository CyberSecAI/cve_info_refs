Debian Bug     : 865303 865416

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10208

    Sergej Schumilo and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that a crafted ext4
    filesystem could trigger memory corruption when it is mounted.  A
    user that can provide a device or filesystem image to be mounted
    could use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-8824

    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false

CVE-2017-8831

    Pengfei Wang discovered that the saa7164 video capture driver
    re-reads data from a PCI device after validating it.  A physically
    present user able to attach a specially designed PCI device could
    use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12190

    Vitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the block layer did not
    correctly count page references for raw I/O from user-space.  This
    can be exploited by a guest VM with access to a host SCSI device
    for denial of service (memory exhaustion) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-13080

    A vulnerability was found in the WPA2 protocol that could lead to
    reinstallation of the same Group Temporal Key (GTK), which
    substantially reduces the security of wifi encryption.  This is
    one of the issues collectively known as "KRACK".

    Updates to GTKs are usually handled by the wpa package, where this
    issue was already fixed (DLA-1150-1).  However, some wifi devices
    can remain active and update GTKs autonomously while the system is
    suspended.  The kernel must also check for and ignore key
    reinstallation.

CVE-2017-14051

    "shqking" reported that the qla2xxx SCSI host driver did not
    correctly validate I/O to the "optrom" sysfs attribute of the
    devices it creates.  This is unlikely to have any security
    impact.

CVE-2017-15115

    Vladis Dronov reported that the SCTP implementation did not
    correctly handle "peel-off" of an association to another net
    namespace.  This leads to a use-after-free, which a local user can
    exploit for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that do not already
    have the sctp module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling
    it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false

CVE-2017-15265

    Michael23 Yu reported a race condition in the ALSA sequencer
    subsystem involving creation and deletion of ports, which could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with access to an ALSA
    sequencer device can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    loss) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-15299

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem did not correctly
    handle update of an uninstantiated key, leading to a null
    dereference.  A local user can use this for denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-15649

    "nixioaming" reported a race condition in the packet socket
    (AF_PACKET) implementation involving rebinding to a fanout group,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with the
    CAP_NET_RAW capability can use this for denial of service (crash
    or data corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-15868

    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol
    (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of the second
    socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to
    memory corruption.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16525

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB serial console
    implementation did not correctly handle disconnection of unusual
    serial devices, leading to a use-after-free.  A similar issue was
    found in the case where setup of a serial console fails.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or data corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16527

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB sound mixer driver did not
    correctly cancel I/O in case it failed to probe a device, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-16529

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB sound driver did not fully
    validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16531

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB core did not validate IAD
    lengths, which could lead to a buffer over-read.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device may be able to
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16532

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB test driver did not
    correctly handle devices with specific combinations of endpoints.
    A physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16533

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB HID driver did not fully
    validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16535

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB core did not validate BOS
    descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer over-read.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device may
    be able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16536

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the cx231xx video capture driver
    did not fully validate the device endpoint configuration, which
    could lead to a null dereference.  A physically present user with
    a specially designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2017-16537

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the imon RC driver did not fully
    validate the device interface configuration, which could lead to a
    null dereference.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16643

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the gtco tablet driver did not
    fully validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16649

    Bjørn Mork found that the cdc_ether network driver did not
    validate the device's maximum segment size, potentially leading to
    a division by zero.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16939

    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam
    Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec (xfrm) implementation
    did not correctly handle some failure cases when dumping policy
    information through netlink.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-1000407

    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.96-2.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions
up to and including 3.2.96.  It also fixes some regressions caused by
the fix for CVE-2017-1000364, which was included in DLA-993-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

I've got the following crash while fuzzing the kernel with syzkaller.

On commit ebb2c2437d8008d46796902ff390653822af6cc4 (Sep 18).

It seems that there's no proper check on the hdesc->bNumDescriptors

value in usbhid\_parse(). it iterates over hdesc->desc and accesses

hdesc->desc[n] fields, which might be out-of-bounds.

The bNumDescriptors in hid descriptor means 'numeric expression

specifying the number of class descriptors'.

The value bNumberDescriptors identifies the number of additional class

specific descriptors present.

(refer to the 6.1.2 HID Descriptor in hid documents :

<http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/HID1_11.pdf>)

So, it can be out-of-bounds in hdesc->desc[n] if there is an

additional class descriptor.

Does the patch below fix this?

Thanks, jaejoong

Hi Kim,

I'm not sure. Is there a check on the bLength field of a

hid\_descriptor struct? Can it be less than sizeof(struct

hid\_descriptor)? If so, we still do an out-of-bounds access to

hdesc->desc[0] (or some other fields).

Thanks!

You are right. I add hid descriptr size from HID device with bLength field.

Could you test and review below patch?

To. usb & input guys.

While dig this report, i was wondering about bNumDescriptors in HID descriptor.

HID document from [usb.org](http://usb.org) said, 'this number must be at least one (1)

as a Report descriptor will always be present.'

There is no mention of the order of class descriptors. Suppose you

have a HID device with a report descriptor and a physical descriptor.

If you have the following hid descriptor in this case,

HID descriptor

 bLength: 12

 bDescriptor Type: HID

 .. skip

 bNumDescriptors: 2

 bDescriptorType: physical

 bDescriptorLength: any

 bDescriptorType: Report

 bDescriptorLength: any

If the order of the report descriptor is the second as above,

usbhid\_parse () will fail because my patch is only check the first

bDescriptor Type.

But If the order of the report descriptor is always first, there is no

problem. How do you think this?

Thanks, jaejoong

The descriptors can appear in any order. You should not assume that

the report descriptor will always come first.

usb\_get\_extra\_descriptor(). If the hid descriptor has the wrong size, it

is possible to access the wrong address. So, before accessing the hid

descriptor, we need to check the entire size through the bLength field.

It also shows how many class descriptors it has through the bNumDescriptors

of the hid descriptor. Assuming that the connected hid descriptor has two

class descriptors(report and physical descriptors), the code below can

cause OOB because hdesc->desc is an array of size 1.

for (n = 0; n < hdesc->bNumDescriptors; n++)

 if (hdesc->desc[n].bDescriptorType == HID\_DT\_REPORT)

 rsize = le16\_to\_cpu(hdesc->desc[n].wDescriptorLength);

Since we know the starting address of the hid descriptor and the value of

the bNumDescriptors is variable, we directly access the buffer containing

the hid descriptor without usbing hdesc->desc to obtain the size of the

report descriptor.

I do not like this patch at all.

It's silly to duplicate the code that is already present in

usb\_get\_extra\_descriptor(). There's no reason to avoid using that

function here.

It's also silly not to use the preformatted hid\_descriptor structure and

instead put error-prone byte offsets directly into the code.

Finally, this patch doesn't fix the actual problem! You don't check

here whether 8+3\*n >= length.

This whole thing could be fixed with a much smaller change to the

original code. Just do something like this:

 num\_descriptors = min\_t(int, hdesc->bNumDescriptors,

 (hdesc->bLength - 6) / 3);

 for (n = 0; n < num\_descriptors; n++)

Right. Your change is better and clear.

With your change, I think we need check the size of hdesc before

accessing hdesc->desc[n] as Andrey Konovalov has already pointed out,

The 6 is equal to

 offsetof(struct hid\_descriptor, desc)

and the 3 is equal to

 sizeof(struct hid\_class\_descriptor)

(at least, I think it is -- the structure is marked as packed so its

size should be 3).

In this case I found the numbers to be more readable, but other people

may have different opinions.

It's possible, but I doubt it. If such devices do exist, they should

never have worked in the first place. Certainly they would generate

warnings or errors during enumeration because of their invalid

descriptors.

descriptors for a device. If the received hid descriptor is smaller than

the size of the struct hid\_descriptor, it is possible to cause

out-of-bounds.

In addition, if bNumDescriptors of the hid descriptor have an incorrect

value, this can also cause out-of-bounds while approaching hdesc->desc[n].

So check the size of hid descriptor and bNumDescriptors.

Changes in v2:

- write a new commit message because orginal version is wrong approach

- add check hid descriptor size

- get proper value for bNumDescriptors as suggested by Alan Stern

- fix the Reported-by

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

HID: usbhid: fix out-of-bounds bug

```
The hid descriptor identifies the length and type of subordinate
descriptors for a device. If the received hid descriptor is smaller than
the size of the struct hid_descriptor, it is possible to cause
out-of-bounds.

In addition, if bNumDescriptors of the hid descriptor have an incorrect
value, this can also cause out-of-bounds while approaching hdesc->desc[n].

So check the size of hid descriptor and bNumDescriptors.
