- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Insteon Hub firmware has a vulnerability in the PubNub message handler for the “cc” channel. Specifically, the handler uses `strcpy` to copy values from a JSON message into fixed-size stack buffers without checking the length of the input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities are present. The `strcpy` function is used to copy data from the JSON message to fixed-size stack buffers. Since the size of the input is not checked, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow by providing a string longer than the buffer size.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary data on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution. This could enable a full compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the PubNub service, which allows remote communication with the Insteon Hub via HTTP requests. The attacker needs to send a crafted JSON message to the "cc" channel through the PubNub API, embedding the malicious JSON string in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the ability to send HTTP requests to the PubNub service. Specifically, the attacker needs a valid `auth` key for the device, and the target Insteon Hub's `insteon-id` which is derived from the MAC address of the device.

The content provides a detailed explanation of the multiple stack buffer overflows (CVE-2017-16252 through CVE-2017-16337) that exist in the Insteon Hub firmware, specifically in how it handles JSON messages received from the PubNub service. The document also provides proof-of-concept exploits for each of these vulnerabilities.
The specific vulnerability mentioned in the CVE, CVE-2017-16281, is one of these stack-based buffer overflows.
The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.
Specifically for CVE-2017-16281, the overflow occurs when parsing the “sub” key of a JSON message with the "s_net" command and the content indicates that the buffer has a size of 32 bytes.
