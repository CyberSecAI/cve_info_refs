The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the TinyCards Android application making an initial HTTP call to a non-HTTPS site during startup when loading content into a WebView. This initial HTTP call redirects to an HTTPS version.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of SSL/TLS during the initial content loading in the WebView, allowing for an unencrypted connection.
- The application's reliance on a remotely loaded web application within an Android WebView, making it susceptible to web-based attacks.
- Vulnerability to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks due to the initial insecure HTTP request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An MITM attacker can intercept the initial HTTP traffic and inject malicious content into the WebView.
- Successful injection of malicious content can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution within the application.
- This enables "remote code execution" (RCE) within the context of the WebView.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack during the initial HTTP request to load web content.
- Interception of unencrypted network traffic.
- Injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript into the initial web request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be positioned as an MITM, able to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate DNS resolution, redirecting the initial request to the attacker's server.
- Ability to inject custom HTML/JavaScript in the response to the intercepted request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in TinyCards Android application version 1.0 (version code 9).
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0 (version code 10) by enforcing SSL for the initial content load.
- The vulnerability was reported to DuoLingo and Google Play Security Reward Program.
