## Insteon Hub PubNub "cc" Channel Message Handler Multiple Stack Overflow Code Execution Vulnerabilities

### Summary

Multiple exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the PubNub message handler for the “cc” channel of Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. Specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Insteon Hub 2245-222 - Firmware version 1012

### Product URLs

<http://www.insteon.com/insteon-hub>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

Insteon produces a series of devices aimed at controlling and monitoring a home: wall switches, led bulbs, thermostats, cameras, etc.
One of those is Insteon Hub, a central controller which allows an end-user to use his smartphone to connect to his own house remotely and manage any other device through it.
The Insteon Hub board utilizes several MCUs, the firmware in question is executed by a Microchip PIC32MX MCU, which has a MIPS32 architecture.

The firmware uses Microchip’s “Libraries for Applications” as core for the application code.
Its functionality resides on a co-operative multitasking loop, which continuously executes all the existing tasks: the library already defines several tasks, e.g. for reading and sending network packets and calling the relative callbacks.
Custom applications building on this library simply need to add new functions at the end of the loop, taking care of executing tasks as quickly as possible, or splitting them in several loop cycles, in order to let other tasks running smoothly.

To enable remote interaction via the Internet, Insteon Hub uses an online service called PubNub (<https://www.pubnub.com/>).
End-users install the “Insteon for Hub” application on their smartphone. Both the smartphone application and Insteon Hub include the PubNub SDK, which allows for a bi-directional communication using PubNub’s REST API.

The interaction with PubNub happens by means of publish/subscribe methods. Each device has a series of channels it can subscribe to, in order to receive published messages.
To subscribe to a specific channel it’s enough to call the function `pubnub_subscribe` (defined in the PubNub SDK), passing as parameter the channel name and a callback function that will be called when a message is received on the specified channel.

The device defines a function which parses messages received from PubNub on channel “cc”: `sub_9d014b1c`. The function uses the `cJSON` library for parsing “JSON” messages and receives a `cJSON` object as parameter, which corresponds to the message sent from an authenticated smartphone application.
As an example, this is a valid JSON message which is used to change the username/password pair of the device:

```
{
    "ser": "",
    "cmd": "s_auth",
    "usr": "myuser",
    "pwd": "mypwd"
}

```

The function initially checks the `cmd` parameter, and depending on that it proceeds to extract other expected parameters, in this case `usr` and `pwd`. The information is then either cached to be handled on the next multitasking loop, or immediately applied from within the current function.

The vulnerable code exists while parsing any JSON element, the following example is the disassembly of the path for the “s\_auth” command:

Looking at the pseudocode:

```
if (cJSON_GetObjectItem(obj, "cmd")) {
    strcpy(buf_cmd, cJSON_GetObjectItem(obj, "cmd")->valuestring);
    if      (!strcmp(buf_cmd, "..."))
    ...
    else if (!strcmp(buf_cmd, "..."))
    ...
    else if (!strcmp(buf_cmd, "s_auth")) {
        if (!cJSON_GetObjectItem(obj, "usr")) goto fail;
        strcpy(buf_usr, cJSON_GetObjectItem(obj, "usr")->valuestring);
        if (!cJSON_GetObjectItem(obj, "pwd")) goto fail;
        strcpy(buf_pwd, cJSON_GetObjectItem(obj, "pwd")->valuestring);
        ...
    }
    ...
}

```

The `src` parameter for `strcpy` is unconstrained, and can lead to a buffer overflow, in the above example a stack-based one.
This same sequence of vulnerable instructions is present for every supported keyword in the message handler.

To send a message, an HTTP GET should be used which embeds the JSON string in the “path” portion of the URL:

```
$ curl https://pubsub.pubnub.com/publish/<pub>/<sub>/<callback>/<channel>/<payload>?auth=<auth-key>

<pub>: PubNub's publishKey. The device uses pub-c-a415cc66-b0ca-4d1d-8d9e-947390b35df3
<sub>: PubNub's subscribeKey. The device uses sub-c-e1c54032-1685-11e4-b69f-02ee2ddab7fe
<callback>: can be set to 0
<channel>: composed by "<insteon-id>-<channel-suffix>". <insteon-id> corresponds to the lower 3 octets of the MAC address and <channel-suffix> is the actual channel name, in this case "cc" (example of full channel name: 112233-cc)
<payload>: contains the JSON message string, the minimal JSON for Insteon is {"ser":""}
<auth-key>: key for access control, 16 bytes hex-encoded

```

Example:

```
$ curl 'https://pubsub.pubnub.com/publish/pub-c-a415cc66-b0ca-4d1d-8d9e-947390b35df3/sub-c-e1c54032-1685-11e4-b69f-02ee2ddab7fe/0/112233-cc/
0/\{"ser":"","cmd":"s_auth","usr":"newusr","pwd":"newpwd"\}?auth=00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF'

```

The following is a list of vulnerable `strcpy` calls and their Proof-of-Concept.
Each PoC shows only the payload portion of the request and uses the placeholder “OVERFLOW” to highlight the vulnerable parameter, which can be replaced with `"A"*0x400` to make the device crash.
All buffer overflows below happen on the stack, and allow for overwriting arbitrarily all $s-registers, saved-pc and saved-fp.
A key with value “x” means that its value is irrelevant.

#### CVE-2017-16252 - cmd key

At 0x9d014cc0 the value for the `cmd` key is copied using `strcpy` to the buffer at `$sp+0x11c`.
This buffer is 20 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.

```
{"cmd": "OVERFLOW"}

```
#### CVE-2017-16253 - cmd sn\_sx, id key

At 0x9d014dd8 the value for the `id` key is copied using `strcpy` to the buffer at `$sp+0x290`.
This buffer is 32 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.

```
{"cmd": "sn_sx", "id": "OVERFLOW", "flg": "x", "cmd1": "x", "cmd2": "x"}

```
#### CVE-2017-16254 - cmd sn\_sx, flg key
