The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16933.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `prepare-dirs` script uses `chown` unsafely. Specifically, it changes the ownership of a directory containing the `$ICINGA2_PID_FILE` to the `$ICINGA2_USER`, then uses `chown` on the file itself.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to the unsafe use of `chown`. After the directory ownership is given to `$ICINGA2_USER`, the attacker can replace the `$ICINGA2_PID_FILE` with a symbolic or hard link pointing to any root-owned file, and the subsequent `chown` operation on the link will change the ownership of the *target* of the link.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain root privileges by changing the ownership of critical system files, such as `/etc/passwd` or root's `.bashrc`.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via the `prepare-dirs` script executed by the init script or systemd service file. The vulnerability is triggered when the script is called using `chown` on a path that has been previously made controllable by `$ICINGA2_USER`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control the `$ICINGA2_USER` and create symlinks within the directory where `$ICINGA2_PID_FILE` resides after the directory ownership is assigned to `$ICINGA2_USER`. The attacker also needs to be able to start, stop and restart the Icinga2 service.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit can occur when a service is started for the first time, requiring the exploitation of a race condition, or more easily, when the service is restarted after being stopped.
- The vulnerability exists in both the init script and systemd service files.
- The recommended fix is to eliminate changing `$ICINGA2_USER` and `$ICINGA2_GROUP` at runtime, and handle permissions during install, removing the need to use `chown` in the script.
- Alternatively, the init/service script could crash if permissions are wrong, requiring users to fix them manually.
