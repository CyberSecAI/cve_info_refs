Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an "access of resource using incompatible type ('type confusion')" when processing specially crafted .dpb files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Type Confusion (CWE-843)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves specially crafted .dpb files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide the vulnerable application with a specially crafted .dpb file. The advisory specifies a low skill level to exploit, indicating the relative ease of crafting such a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory notes that no known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
- The advisory also notes that these vulnerabilities are not remotely exploitable. However, it should be noted that "remotely" in this context refers to the fact that a crafted file must be provided to the vulnerable application and not that the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited by an attacker on the same network as the target device if the attacker is able to deliver the crafted file via network shares, phishing, etc.
- The advisory recommends updating to the latest version of DOPSoft Version 2.
- The affected product is Delta Industrial Automation Screen Editor, Version 2.00.23.00 or prior.
