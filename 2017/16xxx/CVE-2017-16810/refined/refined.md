The provided content relates to CVE-2017-16810.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within the "Variable Set Name" parameter in Octopus Deploy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize or encode the Variable Set Name before displaying it on the "All Variables" tab.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the application. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement
*   Malware distribution
*   Phishing

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a network, where a remote attacker injects malicious code via the vulnerable parameter of the web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have low privileges within the Octopus Deploy application to create a variable set and inject a payload into its name. User interaction is required, as the malicious script is executed when a user views the "All Variables" tab, which displays the crafted "Variable Set Name".
