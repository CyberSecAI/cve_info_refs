  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The regular expressions used for parsing dates are vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unanchored regular expressions with quantifiers that can cause catastrophic backtracking.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service due to excessive CPU usage and increased processing time.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted input strings designed to exploit the vulnerable regular expressions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input string that will be parsed using the vulnerable regex."
