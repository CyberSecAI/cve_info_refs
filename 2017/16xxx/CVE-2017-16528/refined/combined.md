ALSA: seq: Cancel pending autoload work at unbinding device

ALSA sequencer core has a mechanism to load the enumerated devices
automatically, and it's performed in an off-load work.  This seems
causing some race when a sequencer is removed while the pending
autoload work is running.  As syzkaller spotted, it may lead to some
use-after-free:

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

While working on adding USB fuzzing support to syzkaller, I got the

following crash.

On commit 81a84ad3cb5711cec79f4dd53a4ce026b092c432 (4.13+).

My .config is attached. I don't have a reproducer for this bug.

From: Takashi Iwai <ti...@suse.de>

Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: seq: Cancel pending autoload work at unbinding device

ALSA sequencer core has a mechanism to load the enumerated devices

automatically, and it's performed in an off-load work. This seems

causing some race when a sequencer is removed while the pending

autoload work is running. As syzkaller spotted, it may lead to some

use-after-free:

The fix is simply to assure canceling the autoload work at removing

the device.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
