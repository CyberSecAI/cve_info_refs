  "CVE-2017-16666": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Xplico, including a hidden user registration feature, a weak randomization algorithm for activation code generation, and a command injection vulnerability, can be chained to achieve unauthenticated remote root code execution.",
    "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist within Xplico that when chained together allow for remote code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Hidden user registration endpoint (/users/register) allows unauthenticated users to create new accounts.",
      "Weak randomization algorithm used during activation code generation. The activation code (em_key) is generated using a predictable algorithm: md5(email + md5(password) + time()), where 'time()' is the server time without milliseconds. By observing the Date header in server responses, the activation code can be calculated.",
      "Authenticated command injection vulnerability in the PCAP parsing module. The filename of the uploaded PCAP file is directly used in a shell command without proper sanitization, allowing for command injection via specially crafted filenames."
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthenticated remote root code execution. An attacker can gain complete control of the vulnerable system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The attacker first accesses the hidden user registration endpoint and creates a new user account.",
      "The attacker calculates the activation code using the predictable algorithm and activates the created account.",
      "The attacker logs in with the created and activated user.",
       "The attacker uploads a specially crafted PCAP file containing shell commands in the filename, leading to command execution with root privileges when Xplico attempts to calculate the file checksum."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Xplico instance. No prior authentication is required to exploit the initial user creation vulnerability."
