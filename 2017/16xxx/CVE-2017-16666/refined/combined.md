### Security Advisory for Xplico 1.2.0

**Introduction**

Mehmet D. İNCE discovered several vulnerabilities related to Xplico. He identified three different vulnerabilities, two classified as "High severity" and one as "Medium severity". The CVE number assigned for these vulnerabilities is CVE-2017-16666:

<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16666>

We've resolved these issues in a new Xplico package:

xplico - 1.2.0ubuntu1securityonion9

**Resolution**

To resolve these issues, simply install the new Xplico package according to our normal update instructions:

<https://securityonion.net/wiki/Upgrade>

**Mitigations**

Since 2015, our Setup wizard has disabled Xplico by default when choosing the "Best Practices" option:

<https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion-setup/blob/dd9c8e098af3e6bc253570b75b789ff928c10323/debian/patches/streamline-Setup-with-new-defaults-and-add-new-Custom-option>

Since March 2016, our Setup wizard locks down the host-based firewall to block remote connections to Xplico:

<http://blog.securityonion.net/2016/03/securityonion-setup-20120912.html>

Additionally, we recently made some changes to make it easier to totally remove the Xplico package from your system:

<http://blog.securityonion.net/2017/11/securityonion-nsmnow-admin-scripts.html>

<http://blog.securityonion.net/2017/11/securityonion-iso-20151016.html>

<http://blog.securityonion.net/2017/11/securityonion-setup-20120912.html>

Future Security Onion ISO images will no longer include Xplico.

A couple of days ago, I came up with news that Pardus will organize a report-bug contest. I love to contribute to open-source projects. So that was a pretty good chance to revisit one of my old friends, Pardus, and uncover security and/or privacy issues.

It has been a while since I haven’t published a post on our beloved blog. Today I would like to share technical details and POC for a pretty funny vulnerability that I’ve found at GravCMS.

As I’ve been saying since 2015, my pentest team and I love to chase after 0days during penetration test engagements. This time we come across a GravCMS during the external OSINT process.

I believe that doing a security research is all about trying to understand high-level of architecture of the products and finding a creative attack vectors.

I hope this blog post will show some the readers how to start doing security research.

I’ve been doing security researches on softwares for a quite long time. During these researchs, I often find myself in a situation where in I think about the state of mind of developers, problems that occur during developments and core problems of nature of software crafting teams. Thinking about these questions always lead me to realize possible software bugs.

~~People~~ developers are tend to make mistakes by the nature of human being. Mistakes made by developers usually end up with software bugs. If there is a software bug, security researchers always try to take an advantage of this bugs and convert it to a software vulnerability. For that reason, I always start my research by defining a places in softwares where things left to the developer’s initiative. One of good the example for that ‘places’, which also main focus of this post, can be a session validations.

# Advisory | Xplico Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution CVE-2017-16666

 [November 14, 2017November 14, 2017](https://pentest.blog/advisory-xplico-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-cve-2017-16666/)  [Mehmet Ince](https://pentest.blog/author/mehmet-ince/)
[Advisories](https://pentest.blog/category/advisories/)

The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. For example, from a pcap file Xplico extracts each email (POP, IMAP, and SMTP protocols), all HTTP contents, each VoIP call (SIP), FTP, TFTP, and so on. Xplico isn’t a network protocol analyzer. Xplico is an open source Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT).

### Advisory Informations

**Remotely Exploitable:** Yes

**Authentication Required:** NO

**Vendor URL:** www.xplico.org

**CVSSv3 Score:** 9.0 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:U)

**Date of found:** 31 Oct 2017

### Technical Details

We identified three different vulnerability. Combination of these three vulnerability leadto unauthenticated remote root code execution vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability #1 – Hidden User Registration Feature

There is a hidden end-point at inside of the Xplico that allow anyone to create a new user. You can access this registration form by visiting following URL.

http://<ip\_address>:9876/users/register

![](https://pentest.blog/wp-content/uploads/xplico-1.png)

#### Vulnerability #2 – Weak Randomization Algorithm used during Activation Code Generation

Once the user created through /users/register endpoint. This user must be activated through activation e-mail.

```
if ($this->Group->save($this->request->data)) {
                            $this->request->data['User']['password'] = md5($this->request->data['User']['password']);
                            $this->request->data['User']['em_key'] = md5($this->request->data['User']['email'].$this->request->data['User']['password'].time());
                            $gid = $this->Group->getID();
                            $this->request->data['User']['group_id'] = $gid;
                            $this->User->create();
                            if ($this->User->save($this->request->data)) {
                                if (1) {
                                    // send email to confirm registration
                                    mail($this->request->data['User']['email'], "Xplico - Account Activation Request",
                                         "To confirm click the link below\n http://demo.xplico.org/users/registerConfirm/".$this->request->data['User']['em_key']."\n",
                                         "From: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)");
                                    $this->Session->setFlash(__('To complete registration wait the email'));
                                }
                                else {
                                    $this->Session->setFlash(__('Registration Completed'));
                                    $this->User->saveField('em_checked', 1);
                                }
                                $this->redirect('/users/index');
                            }
                            else {
                                $this->Group->delete($gid);
                                $this->Session->setFlash(__('There was a problem saving this information'));
                            }
                        }
```

Activation code of the user stored at **em\_key** field of the database. And then Xplico try to send e-mail that contains this code.

Unfortunately, this e-mail probably not gonna reach to the given e-mail address on most of the installation. But there is an easy way to calculate exactly same value without having e-mail!

```
md5($this->request->data['User']['email'].$this->request->data['User']['password'].time());
```

Look closer to the above code where you will see md5 function call for em\_key generation.

`$this->request->data['User']['email']`: It’s an user input. We know that value.

`$this->request->data['User']['password']` :It’s another user input. We know that value too.

`time()` : This function return current time as a unixtime format. But it does’nt contains miliseconds! So once we recieve a http response from server, we can look at the Date header and calculate exact value as long as execution finished within 1 second.

Here is the http POST request to the user register endpoint. Red colored boxes Show email and password fields being used for em\_key generation.

```
POST /users/register HTTP/1.1
Host: 12.0.0.41:9876

```

Here is the http response from the end-point. It redirect us back to the login page. If that response-response cycle completed within 1 second, that Date value must be same with time() function call result during em\_key generation.

```

Here is the small PoC code for em\_key calculation without receving any e-mail.

```
<?php

$email = "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)";
$password = "123456";

$token = md5($email.md5($password).strtotime("Tue, 31 Oct 2017 08:33:01 GMT"));

echo $token;
```
#### Vulnerability #3 – Authenticated Command Injection

One of the feature of the Xplico is related to the parsing PCAP files. You can upload pcap file through following module. This module is password protected.

![](https://pentest.blog/wp-content/uploads/xplico-2.png)

Once pcap file uploaded, following operating system command will be executed.

```
sh –c md5sum “/opt/xplico/pol_1/sol_1/new/[NAME_OF_PCAP_FILE]” > /tmp/dema_hash.txt
```

So file name (which is directly taken from user input) will be used at inside of above command. By using **$()** or **“** trick for filename, we can execute our own operating system commands.

        This module exploits command injection vulnerability. Unauthenticated users can register a new account and then execute a terminal
        command under the context of the root user.

        The specific flaw exists within the Xplico, which listens on TCP port 9876 by default. The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet
        traffic capture the applications data contained. There is a hidden end-point at inside of the Xplico that allow anyone to create
        a new user. Once the user created through /users/register endpoint, it must be activated via activation e-mail. After the registration Xplico try
        to send e-mail that contains activation code. Unfortunetly, this e-mail probably not gonna reach to the given e-mail address on most of installation.
        But it's possible to calculate exactly same token value because of insecure cryptographic random string generator function usage.

        One of the feature of Xplico is related to the parsing PCAP files. Once PCAP file uploaded, Xplico execute an operating system command in order to calculate checksum
        of the file. Name of the for this operation is direclty taken from user input and then used at inside of the command without proper input validation.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Xplico Remote Code Execution

Disclosed
10/29/2017

Created

#### Description

This module exploits command injection vulnerability. Unauthenticated users can register a new account and then execute a terminal
command under the context of the root user.
The specific flaw exists within the Xplico, which listens on TCP port 9876 by default. The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet
traffic capture the applications data contained. There is a hidden end-point at inside of the Xplico that allow anyone to create
a new user. Once the user created through /users/register endpoint, it must be activated via activation e-mail. After the registration Xplico try
to send e-mail that contains activation code. Unfortunetly, this e-mail probably not gonna reach to the given e-mail address on most of installation.
But it's possible to calculate exactly same token value because of insecure cryptographic random string generator function usage.
One of the feature of Xplico is related to the parsing PCAP files. Once PCAP file uploaded, Xplico execute an operating system command in order to calculate checksum
of the file. Name of the for this operation is direclty taken from user input and then used at inside of the command without proper input validation.

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.
