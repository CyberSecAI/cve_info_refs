Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-16614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The Tpshop application, specifically the `WxPay.tedatac.php` file, takes a user-controlled parameter `fBill` and uses it in a `fopen` call. This allows the attacker to specify a URL or file path that the server will then attempt to access, leading to SSRF.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of the `fBill` parameter, allowing an attacker to control the URL that the server is accessing.
- **Unrestricted File Access:** The `fopen` function, combined with `fpassthru`, allows the attacker to read arbitrary files from the server by using the `file://` protocol.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input (`fBill` and `WxPayDataBase`) before using it in potentially dangerous functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, including configuration files, database credentials, or other private information.
- **Network Port Scanning:** The attacker can use the server to scan ports on internal network hosts which are not accessible from the outside.
- **Information Detection:** Attackers can gather information about the server environment.
- **Internal Network Server Attack:**  The server can be leveraged to attack other internal systems behind the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `WxPay.tedatac.php` script with a manipulated `fBill` parameter.
- The `fBill` parameter can be set to:
  -  `file:///path/to/file` to access local files.
  -  `http://external-url` or `https://external-url` to access external web resources.
  - `ftp://external-ftp` to attempt access to FTP resources
  - Other supported URI schemes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Tpshop application.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerable endpoint `/plugins/payment/weixin/lib/WxPay.tedatac.php` does not require authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Tpshop versions 2.0.6 and earlier.
- The vulnerable code snippet is provided, showing the direct usage of `$_GET['fBill']` in `fopen`.
- The mail archive also contains a link to the CVE entry.
