## Description

[![@dlongley](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168137?u=9dd4a9536ee7876ea1af9dd04ad1f78012648f09&v=4&size=48)](/dlongley)[dlongley](https://github.com/dlongley)opened [on Apr 18, 2013](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/node-http-signature/issues/10#issue-13328266)

There's a security hole with this scheme. It looks like only the header values are signed, not the actual headers (their names) those values are associated with. That means that an attacker can change the meaning of a request by swapping various header values.

For example:

Original request:

```
POST /pay HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Date: Thu, 05 Jan 2012 21:31:40 GMT
X-Payment-Source: src@money.com
X-Payment-Destination: dst@money.com
Authorization: Signature keyId="Test",algorithm="rsa-sha256",headers="x-payment-source x-payment-destination" MDyO5tSvin5...

```

Attacker captures the request and changes it to:

```
POST /pay HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Date: Thu, 05 Jan 2012 21:31:40 GMT
X-Payment-Source: dst@money.com
X-Payment-Destination: src@money.com
Authorization: Signature keyId="Test",algorithm="rsa-sha256",headers="x-payment-destination x-payment-source" MDyO5tSvin5...

```

Note that the "X-Payment-Source" and "X-Payment-Destination" header values have been swapped and their order in the Authorization header have been swapped.

The resulting signature string in the original request will be:

```
src@money.com\n
dst@money.com\n

```

The resulting signature string in the attacker's request will be:

```
src@money.com\n
dst@money.com\n

```

So the signature will still be valid in the attacker's request, however, the attacker will have successfully reversed a financial transaction (in this contrived example).

A solution to this problem would be to include the header names in the signature. They should be normalized to lowercase, etc. If this change were made, the original request's signature string would be:

```
x-payment-source: src@money.com\n
x-payment-destination: dst@money.com\n

```

And in the attacker's request:

```
x-payment-destination: src@money.com\n
x-payment-source: dst@money.com\n

```

As you can see, the attack would fail here as the signature strings are different.
