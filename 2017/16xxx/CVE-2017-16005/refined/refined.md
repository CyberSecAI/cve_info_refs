- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises because the HTTP signature scheme only signs header values and not the associated header names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the flawed implementation of the HTTP signature scheme where the lack of inclusion of header names in the signature allows for manipulation of the request without invalidating the signature.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can change the meaning of the request by swapping header values, leading to potentially severe consequences such as unauthorized transactions or data modification. In the given example, an attacker could reverse a financial transaction by swapping the source and destination of payment.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves capturing a legitimate HTTP request and modifying the header values while maintaining the validity of the signature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify the HTTP request, and they need to understand the structure of the request and which headers are signed. They would need to modify the header values and their corresponding order in the signature header.
