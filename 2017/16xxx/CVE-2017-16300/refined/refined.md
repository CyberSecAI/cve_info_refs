The provided content is related to CVE-2017-16300.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `strcpy` function to copy data from a JSON message to a stack-allocated buffer without proper bounds checking. The size of the copied data is not validated against the buffer's capacity, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the PubNub message handler for the "cc" channel of Insteon Hub.
- Vulnerable `strcpy` calls are present for multiple command keywords in the message handler. Specifically, for CVE-2017-16300, the 'id' parameter for the "sn_ex" command is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Overwriting arbitrary data on the stack.
- Code execution by overwriting saved registers and return addresses.
- Device crash/Denial of Service

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted JSON messages through the PubNub service.
- The JSON messages are sent via an HTTP GET request to the PubNub API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send authenticated HTTP requests to the PubNub service. This implies the attacker would need knowledge of the PubNub publish/subscribe keys, device ID and authentication key.
