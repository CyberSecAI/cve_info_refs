{
  "CVE-2017-3143": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw exists in the way BIND handles TSIG authentication for dynamic updates.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of TSIG signatures",
      "Lack of sufficient access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can manipulate the contents of a DNS zone by forging a valid TSIG or SIG(0) signature for a dynamic update request, potentially leading to unauthorized modification of DNS records.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "DNS protocol exploitation",
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to send and receive messages to an authoritative BIND server",
      "Knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the targeted zone and service"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to modify zone data. It is mitigated by using Access Control Lists (ACLs) that require both address range validation and use of TSIG authentication in parallel."
