**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the web interface of Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web interface of Cisco ACS is susceptible to XSS attacks. Specifically, this is a DOM-based XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected and executed within the user's browser via the Document Object Model.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data before it's rendered within the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Potential for Account Compromise:** This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including session hijacking, credential theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Integrity Impact:** A successful attack has a low integrity impact, as it can modify the displayed web content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attacker can launch the attack remotely over a network.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The victim must interact with a crafted URL or malicious content that triggers the vulnerability.
