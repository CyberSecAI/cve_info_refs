  "CVE-2017-3731": {
    "description": "If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash.",
    "vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds read",
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash) of the server or client application.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker",
    "affected_systems": "SSL/TLS servers or clients running on a 32-bit host with specific ciphers enabled (RC4-MD5 in OpenSSL 1.0.2, CHACHA20/POLY1305 in OpenSSL 1.1.0)",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.",
        "more_info": "The vulnerability is triggered by a truncated packet, which results in an excessive hashing to the edge of accessible memory. This out-of-bounds read usually results in a crash. The vulnerability is present in openssl library"
