Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-3191:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The D-Link DIR-130 and DIR-330 routers do not properly validate authentication requests to the remote login page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the POST request to bypass authentication, gaining access to administrator-only pages without providing valid credentials.
- **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials** The `tools_admin.asp` page discloses the administrator password in base64 encoding. This vulnerability is related, and can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2017-3191.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the router's administrator interface.
- An attacker can obtain the administrator password, potentially gaining full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely, by manipulating the POST request on the remote login page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the remote management login page of the vulnerable D-Link router. No prior authentication is required due to the bypass vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- D-Link DIR-130 (firmware version 1.23)
- D-Link DIR-330 (firmware version 1.12)

**Additional notes:**
- Other D-Link models may also be affected, including the DIR-655, but were not verified.
- The vendor was notified on January 25, 2017.
- A workaround is to restrict access to the remote management interface, or disable it.
- No patch is available from the vendor at the time of the report.
