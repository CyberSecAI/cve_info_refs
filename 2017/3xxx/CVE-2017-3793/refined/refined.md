Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the TCP normalizer of Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The TCP normalizer is not handling certain TCP traffic correctly, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- Improper handling of TCP traffic causes the device to drop all subsequent incoming traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- The Cisco ASA or FTD device will drop all further incoming traffic on all interfaces. This essentially renders the affected device unable to perform its security functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can be remote.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable Cisco ASA or FTD device.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found during internal testing.
- No workarounds exist to mitigate the vulnerability besides patching the software.
- There is no known public announcement or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 4.0 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L
- The CVSS vector indicates that the attack complexity is High.
- The scope is changed.
- The confidentiality and integrity impacts are None, while the availability impact is Low.
