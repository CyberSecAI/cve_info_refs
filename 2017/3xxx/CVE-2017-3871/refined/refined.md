Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-3871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the web network management interface of Cisco Prime Optical for Service Providers. Specifically, sensitive information is disclosed in the configuration generated for a device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information within device configurations.
- **Lack of Proper Access Control:** While the vulnerability requires an authenticated user, the system does not properly restrict access to configuration details or prevent their disclosure to authorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact (C:L):**  An attacker with valid credentials can gain access to sensitive information in device configurations. This may include passwords, private keys, or other confidential data that could be used to compromise the device or the network it operates in. 
- **No Integrity or Availability Impact (I:N/A:N):** The vulnerability does not allow modification of configurations or disruption of service. The impact is limited to the disclosure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):**  The exploit is straightforward to carry out.
- **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):**  The attacker needs valid credentials for the Cisco Prime Optical device, but does not require administrator or elevated privileges.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** No actions are required from the legitimate users of the application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the affected Cisco Prime Optical system
- The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided CVSS vector is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, which corresponds to a Base Score of 4.3.
- No workarounds are available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- There is no known public announcement or exploitation of this vulnerability.
