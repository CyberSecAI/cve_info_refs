Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running Cisco FXOS or NX-OS System Software that is configured for AAA services:   + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Director Switches   + Nexus 1000V Series Switches   + Nexus 1100 Series Cloud Services Platforms   + Nexus 2000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5000 Series Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules   + Unified Computing System (UCS) 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects**Cisco NX-OS Software**      To determine whether a device that is running Cisco NX-OS System Software is configured for AAA, administrators can use the **show running-config | include aaa** command from the Cisco NX-OS CLI and verify that there are **aaa** commands configured on the device. The following example shows sample output from a typical NX-OS AAA configuration:   ```   nx-os-switch# show running-config | include aaaaaa group server tacacs+ aaa authentication login default group aaa authentication login console localaaa accounting default group    ```   To determine whether a device is running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS System Software, administrators can use the **show version** command in the Cisco NX-OS CLI. The following example shows the output of that command for a device that is running Cisco NX-OS System Software Release **6.2(10)**: ```   nxos-switch# show versionCisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) SoftwareTAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tacDocuments:http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9372/tsd_products_support_series_home.htmlCopyright (c) 2002-2015, Cisco Systems, Inc.

The presence of these commands in the device configuration indicates that the device is vulnerable. For additional information about AAA configuration for FXOS-based devices, refer to [Cisco FXOS CLI Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/fxos201/cli-config/b_CLI_ConfigGuide_FXOS_201/platform_settings.html#topic_105C66CC3C7F4D99B08A413FEF5BCEF4).       To determine whether a device is running a vulnerable release of Cisco FXOS, administrators can use the **show version** command in the Cisco FXOS CLI. The following example shows the output of that command for a device that is running Cisco FXOS Release **2.2(1.70)** on the Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall hardware platform: ```   fp4100# show versionFPRM:    Running-Vers: 4.2(1.65)    Package-Vers: 2.2(1.70)    Activate-Status: Ready   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Nexus 4000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode**Note:** The Nexus 4000 Series Switch has entered the end-of-life phase. Refer to [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switch Modules for IBM BladeCenter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-4000-series-switches/eos-eol-notice-c51-733205.html) for additional information.  Details  * **Cisco NX-OS System Software**       To prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, customers should upgrade to a release of Cisco NX-OS System Software that supports secure login enhancements and configure login parameters for the software by using the **login block-for** command in the Cisco NX-OS CLI. Customers who cannot upgrade to or access a Cisco NX-OS System Software image that supports secure login enhancements should implement the workarounds described in this advisory.      The following example shows how to use the **login block-for** command to configure a device to go into quiet mode for 45 seconds if three failed interactive attempts are made within 60 seconds: ```   login block-for 45 attempts 3 within 60   ``` The **system** keyword is needed on the Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches: ```   system login block-for 45 attempts 3 within 60   ``` For more information about configuring login parameters and the **login block-for** command, see the [Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/6_x/nx-os/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_7000_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide__Release_6-x/b_Cisco_Nexus_7000_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide__Release_6-x_chapter_0100.html#task_81E1559B0A0348D29A9FF0106AA2806E) or [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide_7x_chapter_011.html).      This vulnerability is prevented only by configuring the **login block-for** CLI command; otherwise, the device remains vulnerable regardless of the software release the Cisco NX-OS platform is running.      **Update:** The **login block-for** CLI command may not function as desired on the following Cisco NX-OS platforms.   + Nexus 2000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5000 Series Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series SwitchesFor these platforms, it is recommended to not configure the **login block-for** CLI command and instead refer to the [Workarounds](#workarounds) section until fixed software becomes available.       The **login block-for** command does work as expected on the following Cisco NX-OS platforms as of the first fixed release recommended in this advisory:   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Director Switches   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules   + Unified Computing System (UCS) 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects**Cisco FXOS**On Cisco FXOS platforms, Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall, and 9300 Security Appliance, the DoS condition was prevented by adding an internal throttling mechanism for the remote brute-force attack condition. This mechanism does not require users to configure it.  Indicators of Compromise  * On both Cisco FXOS and NX-OS System Software, the AAA-related processes could restart and generate a core file. This indicator will be accompanied by many failed login attempts, indicating that a brute-force attack may be underway. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review any AAA-related core and system log files to determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * **Cisco NX-OS System Software      Configuring a vty Access Class**      On some platforms that are running Cisco NX-OS System Software, it is possible to limit exposure of an affected device by creating a vty access-control list (ACL) on the device and configuring the ACL to permit only known, trusted devices to connect to the device via Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH).         **Note:**   1. This workaround is not available on some platforms that are running Cisco NX-OS, and should be used only where applicable.   2. There is no Cisco UCS workaround that addresses this vulnerability.   3. The ACL in this example is for IPv4. This vulnerability can also be exploited against IPv6 interfaces. If the NX-OS device is configured for IPv6, the same ACL should be configured for the IPv6 address range.The following example shows an ACL that permits access to vtys from the 192.168.1.0/24 netblock and the single IP address 172.16.1.2 while denying access from all other addresses: ```   ip access-list vtyacl  10 permit tcp 192.168.1.0/24 172.16.1.2/32      line vty  access-class vtyacl in   ``` For more information about restricting traffic to vtys, see the [Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/6_x/nx-os/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_7000_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide__Release_6-x/b_Cisco_Nexus_7000_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide__Release_6-x_chapter_01110.html#task_1452624). It is considered a best practice for an NX-OS device to have a vty ACL configured. Refer to [Cisco Guide to Securing Cisco NX-OS Software Devices](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/securing-nx-os.html) for additional information about hardening Cisco NX-OS devices.      **Cisco FXOS**On Cisco FXOS platforms, it is possible to limit the exposure of an affected device by using the **ip-block** command to permit only known, trusted hosts to connect to the device via SSH. The following example show only a subset of IPv4 and IPv6 hosts being permitted to connect via SSH.   ```   scope system  scope services    create ip-block 11.1.1.1 24 ssh    create ipv6-block 2014::10:76:78:107 64 ssh    commit-buffer   ```   For more information about configuring Cisco FXOS IP Access Lists see the "Configure the IP Access List" section of the [Cisco FXOS CLI Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/fxos211/cli-config/b_CLI_ConfigGuide_FXOS_211/security_certifications_compliance.html).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>      Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.      **Customers Without Service Contracts**      Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>.      Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.      **Fixed Releases**      Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following Cisco product tables.   Please note that on the Cisco NX-OS platforms, this vulnerability can still be exploited unless the CLI command **login block-for** is configured. The **login block-for** command should be configured only on the NX-OS platforms that have fixed software available in the following tables.      **Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall: [CSCve03660](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCve03660)**      | Cisco FXOS Major Release - Firepower 4100 | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | Prior to 2.3 | Affected;

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |
