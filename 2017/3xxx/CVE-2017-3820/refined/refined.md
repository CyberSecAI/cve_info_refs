- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) functions of Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of SNMP requests leads to high CPU usage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated, remote attacker can cause high CPU usage on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack using SNMP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires an authenticated remote attacker with the ability to send SNMP requests.
