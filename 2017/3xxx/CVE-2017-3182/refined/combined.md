## ThreatMetrix SDK for iOS fails to validate SSL certificates

#### Vulnerability Note VU#767208

Original Release Date: 2017-01-10 | Last Revised: 2017-01-11

---

### Overview

On the iOS platform, the ThreatMetrix SDK versions prior to 3.2 fail to validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which may allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### Description

| ThreatMetrix is a security library for mobile applications, which aims to provide fraud prevention and device identity capabilities. The ThreatMetrix SDK versions prior to 3.2 do not validate SSL certificates on the iOS platform. An affected application will communicate with <https://h-sdk.online-metrix.net>, regardless of whether the connection is secure or not. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the same network as or upstream from the iOS device may be able to view or modify ThreatMetrix network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue has been addressed in ThreatMetrix SDK versions 3.2 and later. Any iOS application that uses a vulnerable version of the ThreatMetrix SDK will need to be regenerated with an updated version of the library. |
| --- |

| **Avoid untrusted networks**Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack. |
