    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises during a renegotiation handshake in OpenSSL. If the Encrypt-Then-Mac (ETM) extension is negotiated in the renegotiation but was not in the original handshake (or vice-versa), the flag indicating whether to use ETM is changed immediately upon negotiation, rather than at the ChangeCipherSpec (CCS) processing. This can lead to a crash.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of ETM state during renegotiation.",
        "Incorrect timing of setting ETM flags leading to a state conflict."
      ],
      "impact": "A crash in OpenSSL can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, affecting both clients and servers.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks exploiting the renegotiation handshake.",
         "Attacker initiates a renegotiation handshake."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to initiate a TLS renegotiation with different ETM extension settings.",
        "No authentication is required."
      ],
      "additional_details": "The fix involves setting two flags to determine whether to use ETM or not. One for read, and one for write, instead of a single flag. Additionally, the ETM flags are no longer changed at negotiation but rather at CCS processing to avoid race conditions during renegotiation. This vulnerability is specific to OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 before 1.1.0e and does not affect OpenSSL version 1.0.2. The vulnerability is related to the TLS protocol and is not specific to a product but has impact on many Oracle products as it is used by many of them."
