## Das U-Boot AES-CBC encryption implementation contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#166743

Original Release Date: 2017-09-08 | Last Revised: 2017-10-12

---

### Overview

Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an AES encrypted file. For devices utilizing this environment encryption mode, U-Boot's use of a zero initialization vector and improper handling of an error condition may allow attacks against the underlying cryptographic implementation and allow an attacker to decrypt the data.

### Description

| [**CWE-329**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/329.html)**: Not Using a Random IV with CBC Mode -** CVE-2017-3225  Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature uses a zero (0) initialization vector. This allows an attacker to perform dictionary attacks on encrypted data produced by Das U-Boot to learn information about the encrypted data.   | [**CWE-208**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html)**: Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy -** CVE-2017-3226 | | --- |  Devices that make use of Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature using environment encryption (i.e., setting the configuration parameter CONFIG\_ENV\_AES=y) read environment variables from disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with physical access to the device can manipulate the encrypted environment data to include a crafted two-byte sequence which triggers an error in environment variable parsing. This error condition is improperly handled by Das U-Boot, resulting in an immediate process termination with a debugging message.The immediate failure can be used as an oracle for a Vaudenay-style timing attack on the cryptography, allowing a dedicated attacker to decrypt and potentially modify the contents of the device. |
| --- | --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with physical access to the device may be able to decrypt the device's contents. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. U-Boot versions prior to 2017.09 contain the vulnerable code; the feature was deprecated and removed in the 2017.09 release. |
