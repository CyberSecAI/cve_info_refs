**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform actions within the dotCMS administrator panel with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker can induce a victim user with an active session to trigger a malicious request. This can be achieved by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious request and induce a logged in victim to execute it. The attacker doesn't need prior authentication or access to the system other than the ability to reach the victim.
