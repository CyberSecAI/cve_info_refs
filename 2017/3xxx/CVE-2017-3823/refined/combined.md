### Micropatching Remote Code Execution in WebEx Browser Extension (CVE-2017-3823)

This is a short story of writing a micropatch for a widely-used web browser extension.

[Updated on 1/27/17 after Cisco has, again commendably quickly, issued a new WebEx browser extension version to fix a bypass in version 1.0.5.]

Two days ago, [Tavis Ormandy](https://twitter.com/taviso) of Google's Project Zero published details of a [remote code execution bug he had found in Cisco WebEx Browser Extension](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1096) that allowed any web page to launch arbitrary executable on visitor's computer. A thing like this is a big deal: WebEx has ~20 million users and many of them are enterprise and government users, or in other words, interesting targets for professional criminals and spies.

According to Tavis, Cisco was impressively quick to issue an updated version 1.0.5 after receiving his report. The automatically installed update restricts the affected functionality so that it can only be used by web sites originating via HTTPS from domains webex.com and webex.com.cn. For all other web sites, an attempt to exploit the vulnerability would result in a warning dialog like this:

I tried to get Tavis's exploit to work with the updated extension, but clicking OK on the above dialog didn't work. Delivering the exploit from a fake local www.webex.com server didn't - as expected - show the above warning, but also didn't result in the exploit working. My theory is that Cisco also added some quick check to break this particular exploit, which was a smart thing to do, since cross-site scripting issues are surely about to start springing up on webex.com servers (one is already [there](https://twitter.com/mattaustin/status/824034201703878656/photo/1)). If my theory is correct, someone will find (and possibly publish) a way to get around this quick check and combine it with a cross-site scripting issue somewhere in the webex.com domain. By the way, [Pentest-Tools.com](https://pentest-tools.com/information-gathering/find-subdomains-of-domain) finds 544 hosts in the webex.com domain, so the attack surface seems sizeable.

The show is not over either, it seems, as Tavis has apparently found and reported some [residual remote code execution issues with the latest WebEx update](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/824100754650644480).

[Update 1/27/17: [Tavis's report](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1100) is now public. Apparently WebEx developers have implemented the DLL white-listing strategy in version 1.0.5 that we mentioned in the original blog post, but Tavis has found a way around it by misusing the installation functionality for replacing one of the white-listed DLLs with Cisco-signed MSVCR100.DLL. Cisco has since published WebEx update 1.0.7 that fixes this bypass.]

So we have a publicly known remote code execution bug with a working POC on millions of computers, an unknown number of not-yet-updated WebEx extensions, an update that seems to be exploitable with cross-site scripting, and a still-secret residual remote code execution bug in the latest update. One could say there's room for improvement.

**Writing a Micropatch**

The way this WebEx vulnerability is currently fixed doesn't seem good enough to me. (To be fair, it probably also doesn't look good enough to Cisco but they had to do something quick and are probably working on a better long-term solution.) The risk of resurrecting Tavis's exploit with some modification and cross-site scripting, or of simply tricking users to click OK, made me wonder if we could do a better fix with 0patch.

My initial thought was that we couldn't, as browser extensions are essentially JavaScript code and we currently can't patch that. But then my man [Edwin van Andel](https://twitter.com/Yafsec) of [Zerocopter](https://zerocopter.com/) kind of dared me to 0patch this bug so I dropped everything else and fired up my 0patch virtual machines. Surprisingly, it turned out that most of WebEx is actually native code - the browser code is merely in charge of launching ciscowebexstart.exe and passing the meeting parameters to it. It is this executable that then does the heavy lifting.

Taviso's exploit shows that a WebEx message, which is used for launching a meeting, can also be used for executing any exported function with arbitrary arguments from any DLL in the WebEx folder. We don't know, perhaps even from anywhere on the computer or even from a remote network share.

So what if we patched WebEx so that it would only be possible to call a limited set of functions from a limited set of DLLs, namely those that are needed for WebEx's normal operations. Looking at what happens when a meeting is launched, my debugger and I could only find calls to functions from atmccli.DLL.Well, atmccli.DLL only exports four functions, and they all seem to be in use so why don't we simply limit loading of DLLs to atmccli.DLL?

The challenge at this point was to find the place in the code where the DLL name provided in the (potentially malicious) WebEx message is used for actually loading a DLL, likely using LoadLibrary/Ex. If we found that place, we could perhaps replace the DLL name with "atmccli.DLL".

I started by monitoring ciscowebexstart.exe with Process Monitor to see the call stack where Tavis's calc.exe gets launched. This is what I found.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0hdwehkC_nRH46VwG9NijHtSlZcRjCrwwE6xL4dGfYn0KR2zz4IuOjS8LvOhHv1GxHhrw78gn4tlw7KN4VcdeORkaQCoy6bPG26hJHJvorTBnh5cNDalXicSDe7Xfo-IsptqhUiFG2skV/s640/WebEx_cmd_callstack.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0hdwehkC_nRH46VwG9NijHtSlZcRjCrwwE6xL4dGfYn0KR2zz4IuOjS8LvOhHv1GxHhrw78gn4tlw7KN4VcdeORkaQCoy6bPG26hJHJvorTBnh5cNDalXicSDe7Xfo-IsptqhUiFG2skV/s1600/WebEx_cmd_callstack.PNG)

Apparently, it is atgpcext.dll that calls wsystem from MSVCR100.DLL. So I opened it up in IDA and looked around the addresses in the above call stack. Fortunately, a lot of logging strings are sprinkled around the DLL, making it easier to understand what the code is supposed to be doing.

Subsequent hours comprised of typical connect-the-dots reversing steps, switching from IDA to WinDbg to Process Monitor and back in attempting to understand the process from point A (web site sending WebEx a message) to point B (the chosen DLL function gets invoked).

Eventually the dots were connected and I ended up with a decent patch candidate:

MODULE\_PATH "C:\ProgramData\WebEx\WebEx\T30\_MC\atgpcext.dll"

PATCH\_ID 10000

PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER 2

VULN\_ID 2099

PLATFORM win32

patchlet\_start

PATCHLET\_ID 1

PATCHLET\_TYPE 2

PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x5da9f

JUMPOVERBYTES 5 ; We jump over the original "call sub\_21CBA"

N\_ORIGINALBYTES 5

code\_start

    call over

    dw \_\_utf16\_\_("atmccli.dll"),0

over:

    pop eax

code\_end

patchlet\_end

Let's see what this patch does. It gets applied to WebEx's atgpcext.dll at offset 0x5da9f, and replaces the call to function which returns a pointer to the DLL name from the message with a pointer to our own fixed string, "atmccli.dll". This replacing is caused by JUMPOVERBYTES 5, which tells 0patch agent not to continue execution of the original code after returning from the patch code, but to jump over (well, obviously) 5 bytes of that code, effectively landing just behind the "call sub\_21CBA" 5-byte instruction.

But wait, what is this trickery in the patch code? Do we really make a call to some label, then pop eax from the stack? Yes we do. This is an efficient, and very hacker-worthy solution for getting a pointer to a string if you don't have some extra space to store said string. The call namely pushes the address of the "following instruction" to stack, but what follows is not an instruction but the string. The pop then takes the address of the string from stack, and that's all the patch needs to do. (Note that this is an old trick; if you have any references to its past use, do let me know so I can credit the author.)

Now, the result of this patch getting applied is that whichever DLL one instructs WebEx to use, WebEx will always use its own atmccli.DLL. This obviously breaks Tavis's exploit, as he is trying to load MSVCR100.DLL, and we replace that with atmccli.DLL; there is no \_wsystem exported function in atmccli.DLL, so the operation silently fails.

Let's take a look at a video showing how this micropatch blocks the exploit while keeping WebEx functional.

**So How Good Is This Micropatch?**

Generally speaking, there can be two problems with a security patch: it can fail to adequately remove the security issue, and/or it can cause functional problems.

1. **Adequate removal of the security issue**: Frankly, it's hard to say without digging deep into what the four exported functions of atmccli.DLL are capable of. Perhaps one could find that InitControl provides a way to launch arbitrary executables, which would make the patch ineffective. At this point, only WebEx developers know the answer to this, which just underlines my belief that 0patches like these should best be written by original developers - and someday hopefully will be.

   In comparison to Cisco's official fix (update 1.0.5), this patch prevents the exploit even if it originated from one of the webex.com servers, e.g., via cross-site scripting.

   [Update 1/27/17: After the [report about exploiting the WebEx version 1.0.5](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1100) was made public, we reproduced the second exploit and discovered that our original micropatch - the one for version 1.0.1 - also blocked said exploit without any modification, which we think is kind of cool. This [video](https://youtu.be/LknL7hAWvec) shows it best.]
2. **Functional problems**: In an attempt to simulate a vendor's quick response to a published vulnerability in their product, we simply tested the main WebEx functionality: launching and running a meeting. This seemed to work, but again, WebEx developers would quickly notice if this patch broke some functionality as they are deeply familiar with its working. If they said, for instance, that a few other DLLs are also invoked under normal WebEx operations, we could improve the patch to white-list DLL-function pairs, and still keep things tiny.

The entire process of creating this patch took about 8 hours, including finding and setting up the vulnerable extension, getting the exploit to work, reversing WebEx, trying out a couple of inadequate patch candidates, and wrestling with our not-quite-yet-production-quality 0patch Builder that we use for compiling patches.

It is my assessment that with some help of WebEx developers this micropatch - or likely a much better one - could be made in two hours tops. Their knowledge would significantly shorten the reversing time and would allow for finding the optimal patching strategy that would reliably close the hole without impacting functionality.

And this is how we see the future of vulnerability patching.

Security Patching Simplified To The Extreme

### Micropatching Remote Code Execution in WebEx Browser Extension (CVE-2017-3823)

This is a short story of writing a micropatch for a widely-used web browser extension.

[Updated on 1/27/17 after Cisco has, again commendably quickly, issued a new WebEx browser extension version to fix a bypass in version 1.0.5.]

Two days ago, [Tavis Ormandy](https://twitter.com/taviso) of Google's Project Zero published details of a [remote code execution bug he had found in Cisco WebEx Browser Extension](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1096) that allowed any web page to launch arbitrary executable on visitor's computer. A thing like this is a big deal: WebEx has ~20 million users and many of them are enterprise and government users, or in other words, interesting targets for professional criminals and spies.

According to Tavis, Cisco was impressively quick to issue an updated version 1.0.5 after receiving his report. The automatically installed update restricts the affected functionality so that it can only be used by web sites originating via HTTPS from domains webex.com and webex.com.cn. For all other web sites, an attempt to exploit the vulnerability would result in a warning dialog like this:

I tried to get Tavis's exploit to work with the updated extension, but clicking OK on the above dialog didn't work. Delivering the exploit from a fake local www.webex.com server didn't - as expected - show the above warning, but also didn't result in the exploit working. My theory is that Cisco also added some quick check to break this particular exploit, which was a smart thing to do, since cross-site scripting issues are surely about to start springing up on webex.com servers (one is already [there](https://twitter.com/mattaustin/status/824034201703878656/photo/1)). If my theory is correct, someone will find (and possibly publish) a way to get around this quick check and combine it with a cross-site scripting issue somewhere in the webex.com domain. By the way, [Pentest-Tools.com](https://pentest-tools.com/information-gathering/find-subdomains-of-domain) finds 544 hosts in the webex.com domain, so the attack surface seems sizeable.

The show is not over either, it seems, as Tavis has apparently found and reported some [residual remote code execution issues with the latest WebEx update](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/824100754650644480).

[Update 1/27/17: [Tavis's report](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1100) is now public. Apparently WebEx developers have implemented the DLL white-listing strategy in version 1.0.5 that we mentioned in the original blog post, but Tavis has found a way around it by misusing the installation functionality for replacing one of the white-listed DLLs with Cisco-signed MSVCR100.DLL. Cisco has since published WebEx update 1.0.7 that fixes this bypass.]

So we have a publicly known remote code execution bug with a working POC on millions of computers, an unknown number of not-yet-updated WebEx extensions, an update that seems to be exploitable with cross-site scripting, and a still-secret residual remote code execution bug in the latest update. One could say there's room for improvement.

**Writing a Micropatch**

The way this WebEx vulnerability is currently fixed doesn't seem good enough to me. (To be fair, it probably also doesn't look good enough to Cisco but they had to do something quick and are probably working on a better long-term solution.) The risk of resurrecting Tavis's exploit with some modification and cross-site scripting, or of simply tricking users to click OK, made me wonder if we could do a better fix with 0patch.

My initial thought was that we couldn't, as browser extensions are essentially JavaScript code and we currently can't patch that. But then my man [Edwin van Andel](https://twitter.com/Yafsec) of [Zerocopter](https://zerocopter.com/) kind of dared me to 0patch this bug so I dropped everything else and fired up my 0patch virtual machines. Surprisingly, it turned out that most of WebEx is actually native code - the browser code is merely in charge of launching ciscowebexstart.exe and passing the meeting parameters to it. It is this executable that then does the heavy lifting.

Taviso's exploit shows that a WebEx message, which is used for launching a meeting, can also be used for executing any exported function with arbitrary arguments from any DLL in the WebEx folder. We don't know, perhaps even from anywhere on the computer or even from a remote network share.

So what if we patched WebEx so that it would only be possible to call a limited set of functions from a limited set of DLLs, namely those that are needed for WebEx's normal operations. Looking at what happens when a meeting is launched, my debugger and I could only find calls to functions from atmccli.DLL.Well, atmccli.DLL only exports four functions, and they all seem to be in use so why don't we simply limit loading of DLLs to atmccli.DLL?

The challenge at this point was to find the place in the code where the DLL name provided in the (potentially malicious) WebEx message is used for actually loading a DLL, likely using LoadLibrary/Ex. If we found that place, we could perhaps replace the DLL name with "atmccli.DLL".

I started by monitoring ciscowebexstart.exe with Process Monitor to see the call stack where Tavis's calc.exe gets launched. This is what I found.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0hdwehkC_nRH46VwG9NijHtSlZcRjCrwwE6xL4dGfYn0KR2zz4IuOjS8LvOhHv1GxHhrw78gn4tlw7KN4VcdeORkaQCoy6bPG26hJHJvorTBnh5cNDalXicSDe7Xfo-IsptqhUiFG2skV/s640/WebEx_cmd_callstack.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0hdwehkC_nRH46VwG9NijHtSlZcRjCrwwE6xL4dGfYn0KR2zz4IuOjS8LvOhHv1GxHhrw78gn4tlw7KN4VcdeORkaQCoy6bPG26hJHJvorTBnh5cNDalXicSDe7Xfo-IsptqhUiFG2skV/s1600/WebEx_cmd_callstack.PNG)

Apparently, it is atgpcext.dll that calls wsystem from MSVCR100.DLL. So I opened it up in IDA and looked around the addresses in the above call stack. Fortunately, a lot of logging strings are sprinkled around the DLL, making it easier to understand what the code is supposed to be doing.

Subsequent hours comprised of typical connect-the-dots reversing steps, switching from IDA to WinDbg to Process Monitor and back in attempting to understand the process from point A (web site sending WebEx a message) to point B (the chosen DLL function gets invoked).

Eventually the dots were connected and I ended up with a decent patch candidate:

MODULE\_PATH "C:\ProgramData\WebEx\WebEx\T30\_MC\atgpcext.dll"

PATCH\_ID 10000

PATCH\_FORMAT\_VER 2

VULN\_ID 2099

PLATFORM win32

patchlet\_start

PATCHLET\_ID 1

PATCHLET\_TYPE 2

PATCHLET\_OFFSET 0x5da9f

JUMPOVERBYTES 5 ; We jump over the original "call sub\_21CBA"

N\_ORIGINALBYTES 5

code\_start

    call over

    dw \_\_utf16\_\_("atmccli.dll"),0

over:

    pop eax

code\_end

patchlet\_end

Let's see what this patch does. It gets applied to WebEx's atgpcext.dll at offset 0x5da9f, and replaces the call to function which returns a pointer to the DLL name from the message with a pointer to our own fixed string, "atmccli.dll". This replacing is caused by JUMPOVERBYTES 5, which tells 0patch agent not to continue execution of the original code after returning from the patch code, but to jump over (well, obviously) 5 bytes of that code, effectively landing just behind the "call sub\_21CBA" 5-byte instruction.

But wait, what is this trickery in the patch code? Do we really make a call to some label, then pop eax from the stack? Yes we do. This is an efficient, and very hacker-worthy solution for getting a pointer to a string if you don't have some extra space to store said string. The call namely pushes the address of the "following instruction" to stack, but what follows is not an instruction but the string. The pop then takes the address of the string from stack, and that's all the patch needs to do. (Note that this is an old trick; if you have any references to its past use, do let me know so I can credit the author.)

Now, the result of this patch getting applied is that whichever DLL one instructs WebEx to use, WebEx will always use its own atmccli.DLL. This obviously breaks Tavis's exploit, as he is trying to load MSVCR100.DLL, and we replace that with atmccli.DLL; there is no \_wsystem exported function in atmccli.DLL, so the operation silently fails.

Let's take a look at a video showing how this micropatch blocks the exploit while keeping WebEx functional.

**So How Good Is This Micropatch?**

Generally speaking, there can be two problems with a security patch: it can fail to adequately remove the security issue, and/or it can cause functional problems.

1. **Adequate removal of the security issue**: Frankly, it's hard to say without digging deep into what the four exported functions of atmccli.DLL are capable of. Perhaps one could find that InitControl provides a way to launch arbitrary executables, which would make the patch ineffective. At this point, only WebEx developers know the answer to this, which just underlines my belief that 0patches like these should best be written by original developers - and someday hopefully will be.

   In comparison to Cisco's official fix (update 1.0.5), this patch prevents the exploit even if it originated from one of the webex.com servers, e.g., via cross-site scripting.

   [Update 1/27/17: After the [report about exploiting the WebEx version 1.0.5](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1100) was made public, we reproduced the second exploit and discovered that our original micropatch - the one for version 1.0.1 - also blocked said exploit without any modification, which we think is kind of cool. This [video](https://youtu.be/LknL7hAWvec) shows it best.]
2. **Functional problems**: In an attempt to simulate a vendor's quick response to a published vulnerability in their product, we simply tested the main WebEx functionality: launching and running a meeting. This seemed to work, but again, WebEx developers would quickly notice if this patch broke some functionality as they are deeply familiar with its working. If they said, for instance, that a few other DLLs are also invoked under normal WebEx operations, we could improve the patch to white-list DLL-function pairs, and still keep things tiny.

The entire process of creating this patch took about 8 hours, including finding and setting up the vulnerable extension, getting the exploit to work, reversing WebEx, trying out a couple of inadequate patch candidates, and wrestling with our not-quite-yet-production-quality 0patch Builder that we use for compiling patches.

It is my assessment that with some help of WebEx developers this micropatch - or likely a much better one - could be made in two hours tops. Their knowledge would significantly shorten the reversing time and would allow for finding the optimal patching strategy that would reliably close the hole without impacting functionality.

And this is how we see the future of vulnerability patching.

# How to protect yourself from the WebEx extension

On Monday, [Tavis Ormandy of Project Zero revealed](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1096&ref=words.filippo.io) that the Cisco WebEx Chrome extension (20M users) has a critical vulnerability.

> OMFG🔥 The WebEx Chrome extension has a trivial code execution vulnerability: any website could just install malware on your machine silently [https://t.co/3hsvUaQRJU](https://t.co/3hsvUaQRJU?ref=words.filippo.io)

This is the tl;dr: **ANY website can silently load a specially-named file, that can ask the WebEx extension to execute anything they want on your computer**.

This is exactly the kind of "just visit this random website and now you have malware" scenarios that we haven't seen in a while (on a large scale), and that we don't want to go back to.

Needless to say, this is pretty damn irresponsible of Cisco, even if they deserve praise for fixing it fast, I guess.

An updated, fixed version (~~1.0.3~~ 1.0.7) is available. **It will roll out automatically**, but I don't know in how long.

Here is how to check that you have the latest version, how to install it if not, and how to further protect you from the weak patch by using a **dedicated profile**.

(Read the bug linked at the top for the l33t technical details, this is full of screenshot for the users.)

## Checking and updating

First, go to the Extensions page.

![Go to the extensions menu](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2017/01/OIOW2X9.png)

If you have version ~~1.0.3~~ 1.0.7, you're good.

![If you have version 1.0.7, you're good](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2017/01/jRVTUmV.png)

If not, click the "Developer mode" checkbox and then click the "Update extensions now" button.

![Developer mode and then update now](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2017/01/Untitled-2.png)

Make sure that the version updates to ~~1.0.3~~ 1.0.7 and then untick "Developer mode".

## Using a dedicated profile

The protection of the patch is pretty weak. All it does is show a popup like the following. Clicking OK will still cause malware to be installed.

![popup](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2017/01/Untitled.png)

Moreover, the webex.com website is still allowed to bypass the popup. If a vulnerability is found on the webex.com website, it can be used to compromise any machine running even the updated version.

Here is how you can make a dedicated WebEx profile to mitigate that risk.

**First, uninstall WebEx from the Extensions page.**

Then click the menu in the top-right corner (it can be your name or a small person icon) and click "Manage People".

![Manage People](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2017/01/Untitled-5.png)

Click "Add person", call it "WebEx", and click "Save". You'll now be in a browser window with "WebEx" in the top-right corner (it's called a profile).

![WebEx profile](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2017/01/Untitled-3.png)

Install WebEx again in this window/profile.

Don't use the WebEx profile for anything else than WebEx.

To open it later from your normal profile, click on the top-right menu, and then click "WebEx".

![WebEx menu](https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2017/01/Untitled-4.png)

Now any website you visit from your normal profile can't attack the WebEx extension.

| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.8 |

## Cisco WebEx web browser extension allows arbitrary code execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#909240

Original Release Date: 2017-01-27 | Last Revised: 2017-01-27

---

### Overview

The Cisco WebEx extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable Windows system.

### Description

| Cisco WebEx is a suite of online meeting software. WebEx meetings are usually joined through a web browser link. The WebEx software is launched through use of a web browser extension. The Cisco WebEx web browser extension allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable Windows system.  The WebEx Google Chrome extension versions older than 1.0.7 are affected.The WebEx Internet Explorer GpcContainer ActiveX control version 2.1.0.9 and earlier are reported to be affected.The WebEx Firefox ActiveTouch General Plugin Container version 3006.0.2016.222 and earlier are reported to be affected.Exploit code for the Google Chrome extension is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially-crafted web page, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Chrome web browser extension version 1.0.7. Please see the [Cisco Security Advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170124-webex) for more details. Internet Explorer, Firefox, and other Windows browser users should consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Disable the WebEx ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable WebEx ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:  {E06E2E99-0AA1-11D4-ABA6-0060082AA75C}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{E06E2E99-0AA1-11D4-ABA6-0060082AA75C}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{E06E2E99-0AA1-11D4-ABA6-0060082AA75C}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400Since Internet Explorer version 8, ActiveX controls require [per-site activation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd433050%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx#_user) before they execute. Note, however, that per-site ActiveX in Internet Explorer occurs on the domain level, rather than the subdomain level. For example, if a user has agreed to run the WebEx ActiveX control on any foo.webex.com domain, then it will run without prompting on any bar.webex.com domain.**Disable the WebEx plugin in Firefox**The vulnerable WebEx Firefox plugin can be disabled by visiting about:addons, viewing the Plugins section and selecting Never Activate for the ActiveTouch General Plugin Container plugin.Note that in the default configuration of Firefox, the browser will prompt the user before running the plugin upon visiting each new subdomain. This may help prevent a "drive-by download" attack without user interaction on Firefox.**Uninstall WebEx software**According to the [Cisco Security Advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170124-webex), this vulnerability can be mitigated on all browsers by running the Meeting Services Removal Tool, which is available from <https://help.webex.com/docs/DOC-2672>. |
