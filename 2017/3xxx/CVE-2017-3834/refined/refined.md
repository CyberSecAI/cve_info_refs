Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3834:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a default credential issue in Cisco Aironet 1830 Series and 1850 Series Access Points running Cisco Mobility Express Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Default Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of default credentials within the Cisco Mobility Express software. This is explicitly stated as a "default credential vulnerability".
- **CWE-255:** The advisory notes CWE-255, which refers to "Credentials Management", further confirming the default credential problem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Control:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain complete control of the affected access point. This level of access allows for arbitrary actions on the device, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches,
    - Denial of Service,
    - Further exploitation of the network

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing physical access to the device.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, further increasing the risk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable access point through the network.
- **No Prior Knowledge:** The attacker does not need valid credentials or prior access to the device.
- **Exploitation Tools:** The attacker would likely need some kind of tool to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Affected Products:** Cisco Aironet 1830 Series and 1850 Series Access Points running Cisco Mobility Express Software (8.2.*x* releases prior to 8.2.121.0) are vulnerable.
- **Unaffected Products:**  The advisory confirms that Cisco Aironet Access Points running Cisco Lightweight AP Software or Cisco IOS Software are not affected. It also confirms that some later Aironet models and wireless controllers are not vulnerable.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a critical CVSS base score of 9.8, highlighting the severity of this flaw.
- **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available, making software updates the primary mitigation strategy.
- **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, with specific fixed releases listed in the advisory.
