### Overview

Inmarsat Solutions offers a shipboard email client service, AmosConnect 8 (AC8), which was designed to be utilized over satellite networks in a highly optimized manner. IOActive has identified two security vulnerabilities in the client software: On-board ship network access could provide visibility of user names and passwords configured on the client device. A backdoor account has been identified in the client that provides full system privileges. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. An attacker with high skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability. AmosConnect 8 has been deemed end of life, and no longer supported. Inmarsat customers must contact Inmarsat Customer Service to obtain the replacement mail client software.
