Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2017-3112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read issue in Adobe Flash Player. This allows for remote code execution when a specially crafted SWF file is processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The Flash Player attempts to access memory outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This can lead to a crash or, in this case, code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the Flash Player process. This could lead to full system compromise depending on the environment in which flash player is executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted SWF File:** An attacker needs to create a malicious SWF file that triggers the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
*   **Web Browsing:** The attack is carried out when a victim visits a website containing the malicious SWF file and the Flash Player plugin loads this file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior access to the victim's machine.
*   **SWF Creation:** The attacker must be capable of creating malicious SWF content.
*   **Web Hosting/Distribution:** The attacker needs a means to deliver the malicious SWF file to the victim through the web, often via embedding the malicious SWF within a web page

**Additional Notes:**
*   This CVE is part of a group of vulnerabilities fixed in Adobe Flash Player version 27.0.0.187, as noted in the Gentoo and Red Hat security advisories.
*   The provided Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2017:3222 indicates this vulnerability is considered **Critical**.
*   The advisory also explicitly mentions that this vulnerability could cause Flash Player to crash or disclose sensitive information.
