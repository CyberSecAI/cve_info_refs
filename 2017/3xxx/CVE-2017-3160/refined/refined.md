Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Cordova-Android build scripts, when adding the Android platform for the first time or creating a new project, fetch the Gradle build tool.
*   The default URL used to download Gradle used `http` instead of `https`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability:** The use of `http` makes the Gradle download process vulnerable to MitM attacks. An attacker could intercept the download and replace the legitimate Gradle executable with a malicious one.
*   **Insecure Download:** Downloading the build tool over an insecure channel allows for tampering during transit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Build Environment:** If a malicious Gradle executable is downloaded, an attacker can potentially compromise the entire build process.
*   **Malicious App Injection:** A tampered Gradle could inject malicious code into the application being built, potentially allowing the attacker to control the app's behavior.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:** The vulnerability allows for a supply chain attack, where malicious code is introduced at the build stage, affecting all applications built using the compromised environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the developer's machine and the Gradle distribution server can intercept the insecure download request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the developer and the Gradle distribution server. This could be done on the local network (e.g., compromised WiFi) or through other network-level attacks.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Cordova-Android versions 6.1.1 and below.
*   The fix was released in `cordova-android@6.1.2`.
*   A mitigation step was to set the `CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL` environment variable to the secure `https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip`.
* The severity is rated as high.
