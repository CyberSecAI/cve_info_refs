Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3737:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenSSL 1.0.2 (versions 1.0.2b through 1.0.2m) handles the "error state" mechanism during a TLS handshake. Specifically, if a fatal error occurs during the handshake, the intended behavior is that OpenSSL should enter an error state and reject subsequent attempts to continue the handshake. However, this mechanism fails when `SSL_read()` or `SSL_write()` are directly called by an application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   Improper handling of the OpenSSL error state.
-   Direct calls to `SSL_read()` or `SSL_write()` after a handshake failure bypass the error state.
-   Data is passed without being encrypted/decrypted, directly from the SSL/TLS record layer.
-   This can lead to a security bypass of the encryption/decryption process.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   A successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This is because data is transmitted unencrypted.

**Attack vectors:**

-   Network-based attacks.
-   Requires a specific sequence of events, where a handshake fails and is followed by application calls to `SSL_read()` or `SSL_write()` on the same SSL object.
-   The attacker needs to cause the handshake failure in the target application, and then have the application continue processing using the vulnerable calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Ability to cause a fatal error in a TLS handshake.
- The attacker must induce an application to make vulnerable calls to `SSL_read()` or `SSL_write()` after a handshake failure.
- The attacker needs to be in a network position to intercept the communication.

**Additional Details From Provided Content:**

- The vulnerability exists within OpenSSL versions 1.0.2b through 1.0.2m.
-  OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected by this particular vulnerability.
- A patch was introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.2n to correct the flaw.
- Several sources emphasize that this vulnerability requires a flaw in the application logic which would call SSL_read/SSL_write after receiving a fatal error for exploitation to be successful.
- Red Hat's security advisories mention that the vulnerability is rated as "Moderate".
- Oracleâ€™s security advisories also describe the vulnerability with the same root cause information. They note that the vulnerability is addressed with the April 2018 CPU, as well as July 2018 and 2019 CPUs depending on the affected products.
- NetApp acknowledges the vulnerability with the same underlying cause within their products. They have released updates that incorporate patched versions of OpenSSL in various products.
- Siemens also acknowledges the issue in their industrial products, attributing the root cause to OpenSSL versions below 1.0.2n and 1.1.0h.

**Summary**
The content confirms the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-3737, specifically a bypass in the TLS implementation in OpenSSL versions 1.0.2b to 1.0.2m. The primary vulnerability is the improper handling of the error state of the SSL object after a failed handshake resulting in unencrypted data transfer if certain API calls are made on the failed object. All sources confirm the flaw and the various methods of patching.
