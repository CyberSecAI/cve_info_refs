Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3202:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way some Java implementations of Action Message Format 3 (AMF3) deserializers handle the *dynamic* trait of AMF3 objects. These implementations allow the instantiation of arbitrary classes via their public parameter-less constructors and subsequently call arbitrary Java Bean setter methods. This can be exploited if there are classes in the application's classpath that, when instantiated and manipulated this way, lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources:** The AMF3 deserializer allows arbitrary class instantiation and manipulation through setter methods, leading to unintended code execution.
*   Insecure Deserialization: While not directly involving `java.io.Externalizable`, this vulnerability is related to insecure deserialization because the attacker can control the classes being instantiated and their properties to cause harm.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution on the server. An attacker can send a malicious AMF3 message that, upon deserialization, instantiates a harmful class and triggers arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the AMF3 deserialization process.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious AMF3 messages to the vulnerable server.
*   This may be through an exposed port accepting AMF3 messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to spoof or control the connection to the server.
*   They need to have the knowledge of the vulnerable AMF3 implementations.
*   They need to have knowledge of exploitable classes present in the server application's classpath.
* The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious AMF3 message containing class names and property values that trigger arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by the *dynamic* trait of AMF3 objects.
*   The vulnerability is similar to the one reported by Wouter Coekaerts in 2011.
*   This vulnerability is present in Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel version 2.2.0.
*   Other libraries are also affected by similar issues. These include: Flex BlazeDS and GraniteDS
