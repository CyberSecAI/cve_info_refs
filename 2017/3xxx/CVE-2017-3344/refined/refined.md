The provided document is a security advisory from Oracle, detailing a Critical Patch Update (CPU) for January 2017. While the document lists numerous CVEs addressed in this update, it does not provide specific details for CVE-2017-3344. However, it does mention that CVE-2017-3344 is addressed within the Oracle E-Business Suite component.  The document states that CVE-2017-3344 is grouped with a set of other CVEs (CVE-2017-3333, CVE-2017-3334, CVE-2017-3335, CVE-2017-3336, CVE-2017-3338, CVE-2017-3339, CVE-2017-3340, CVE-2017-3341, CVE-2017-3343, CVE-2017-3346, CVE-2017-3348, CVE-2017-3349, CVE-2017-3350, CVE-2017-3351, CVE-2017-3352, CVE-2017-3353, CVE-2017-3354, CVE-2017-3357, CVE-2017-3358). These CVEs share the same risk matrix entry, which includes the following information:

**Vulnerability Details (shared with CVE-2017-3344):**

*   **Component:** Oracle Common Applications
*   **Sub-component**: Resources Module
*   **Protocol:** HTTP
*   **Remote Exploit without Auth.:** Yes
*   **CVSS v3.0 Base Score:** 8.2
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low
*   **Privileges Required:** Required
*   **User Interaction:** None
*   **Scope:** Changed
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** High
*   **Integrity Impact:** Low

*   **Affected Versions:** 12.1.1, 12.1.2, 12.1.3, 12.2.3, 12.2.4, 12.2.5, 12.2.6

**Summary:**
*   **Root Cause of vulnerability**: Undisclosed vulnerability in the Resources Module of Oracle Common Applications.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Allows for remote exploitation over HTTP with low attack complexity. Requires user privileges for successful exploitation. The scope of the vulnerability is changed, which means it can impact resources beyond the vulnerable component itself.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a high impact on confidentiality, a low impact on integrity, and no impact on availability.
*  **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network using HTTP.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable component of Oracle E-Business Suite and valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

It is important to note that the risk matrix describes the *potential* impact of the vulnerability assuming the vulnerability can be fully exploited and that impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability can vary based on other system configurations.
