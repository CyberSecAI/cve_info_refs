Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3802:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the web interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The CUCM web interface is susceptible to XSS attacks, specifically CWE-79. This means an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they interact with the affected CUCM web interface.
- This could lead to various impacts, such as:
  - Session hijacking: The attacker could steal the user's session cookies and gain access to their account.
  - Defacement: The attacker could modify the content of the web pages displayed to the user.
  - Redirection: The attacker could redirect the user to malicious websites.
  - Data theft: The attacker might steal sensitive information displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N).
- User interaction is required (UI:R) - the user must visit a malicious link/page or interact with an injected script for the attack to work.
- The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C), because the injected script runs in the context of the user's browser within the application's domain, which could allow for broader attack surface against the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a user of the CUCM web interface or inject malicious scripts into the web pages displayed to the user.
- No authentication is required. The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.

**Additional Details:**

- The CVSS base score is 6.1, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
- The advisory notes that there are no known public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of publishing.
- The advisory mentions a specific bug ID (CSCvc20679) that provides information on affected software releases and fixed versions.
- A link to the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin on Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threat Vectors is included.
- There are no workarounds available other than applying a patch.

**Summary of CVE-2017-3802:**
CVE-2017-3802 is a medium severity XSS vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious scripts through a crafted URL or via injecting the script directly, which will then be executed in a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, redirection, or data theft.
