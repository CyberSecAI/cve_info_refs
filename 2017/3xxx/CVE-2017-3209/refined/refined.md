Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **incorrect default permissions** on the DBPOWER U818A WIFI quadcopter drone. Specifically, the drone's FTP server allows anonymous access without a password and grants full filesystem read/write permissions to the anonymous user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The FTP server is configured with anonymous login enabled and full file system access.
*  **Lack of Authentication:** The FTP server allows anonymous access, which means no user credentials or password are required to connect.
*   **Excessive Permissions:** The anonymous user is granted full read/write privileges, which permits access to any file on the system.
*   **Use of outdated software:** The device uses BusyBox 1.20.2 which was released in 2012 and may be vulnerable to other known vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** A remote attacker can read arbitrary files from the drone, including images and videos recorded by the device.
*   **System File Modification:** A remote attacker can modify or replace system files, potentially including sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Modifying system files may allow an attacker to gain further access to the drone, possibly leading to root access or complete control.
*   **Data Exposure:** Confidential data stored on the drone, such as recorded video, can be accessed and exfiltrated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers must be within range of the drone's open Wi-Fi access point (local network).
*   **FTP Protocol:** The attack is carried out through the drone's insecure FTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within the range of the drone's local Wi-Fi access point.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to connect to the drone's Wi-Fi network.
*   **FTP Client:** The attacker needs an FTP client to interact with the drone's FTP server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable FTP server running on the drone.

**Additional Information**

* The vulnerability is found in other similar models from different suppliers (Udirc and Forcel U818A models).
* The vulnerability was reported by Junia Valente from the Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab at UT Dallas.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)
