Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-3059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that occurs due to a lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it, specifically within the handling of the `New` opcode in Adobe Flash AS2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that the code attempts to access or manipulate an object that has already been freed from memory.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate if an object exists before operating on it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This code runs under the context of the current process, typically with the privileges of the user running the Flash Player.
- **Crash:** The vulnerability can lead to the Flash Player crashing, impacting the user's browsing experience.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not directly stated for CVE-2017-3059, other related CVEs in the same advisory (APSB17-10) note that these can also lead to sensitive information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SWF File:** An attacker crafts a malicious SWF (Shockwave Flash) file designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The user must interact with the malicious SWF file for the exploit to be successful. This can occur by:
    - Visiting a malicious webpage containing the SWF file.
    - Opening a malicious file (e.g., an email attachment containing the SWF file).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need physical access to the victim's system.
- **Ability to Serve Malicious SWF:** The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious SWF file to the target, usually through a web server or other means of file distribution.
- **User Lures:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects Adobe Flash Player.
- Adobe released a patch to address this issue.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by a specific Digital Vaccine filter ID ('27697').
- The severity of this vulnerability was rated as "Critical" by Red Hat.
