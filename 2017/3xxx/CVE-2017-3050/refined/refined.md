Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of GIF images within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This insufficient validation leads to a write past the end of an allocated object in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to improper data validation when processing GIF images. This allows an attacker to write to memory locations beyond the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This means that an attacker could gain control of the user's system and perform malicious actions, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious File:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted malicious GIF file using Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- **Malicious Page:** The vulnerability can also be triggered by visiting a malicious web page that contains a crafted GIF image, which is then processed by Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Position:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required as the target user must either open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
- **Crafted GIF Image:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted GIF file designed to trigger the out-of-bounds write.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley (mr_me) of Offensive Security working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative and Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
- A patch for this vulnerability is included in security updates for Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
