Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2017-3199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `externalizable` trait within AMF3 Java implementations. Specifically, these implementations incorrectly interpret the `flash.utils.IExternalizable` interface from the AMF3 specification as equivalent to Java's `java.io.Externalizable`. This allows the deserialization of arbitrary Java classes implementing `java.io.Externalizable`, leading to the execution of their `readExternal()` methods. By crafting a malicious AMF message with a class like `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef` or `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef2` which implements `java.io.Externalizable`, an attacker can trigger a chain of calls that ultimately lead to `ObjectInputStream.readObject()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is the insecure deserialization of untrusted data. The AMF libraries do not properly sanitize or validate the class types that are being deserialized via the externalizable trait, resulting in the ability to reconstruct arbitrary objects, which can be exploited. Specifically, they deserialize classes implementing `java.io.Externalizable`
2.  **Incorrect Interpretation of AMF3 Specification:** Libraries incorrectly mapping `flash.utils.IExternalizable` to `java.io.Externalizable` lead to the vulnerability.
3. **Java RMI exploitation**: The ability to instantiate `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef`/`sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef2` which through their `readExternal()` method call `sun.rmi.transport.LiveRef.read(ObjectInput, boolean)` and eventually `ObjectInputStream.readObject()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious AMF message, an attacker can cause the vulnerable Java application to deserialize and execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted AMF message to a vulnerable server. This could be done through various channels depending on how the application uses AMF, such as an exposed endpoint accepting AMF messages.
*   **RMI server spoofing**: An attacker that can spoof an RMI server or control an RMI connection can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send AMF Messages:** The attacker must be able to send AMF messages to a vulnerable endpoint on the target server.
*   **Knowledge of Java RMI:** The attacker must have knowledge of how to create and use Java RMI related classes such as `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef`/`sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef2` to construct the malicious AMF payload.
*   **Exploit Gadgets**: The attacker must be aware of the necessary classes in the classpath to achieve remote code execution during the deserialization process.

**Additional Details from the Blog Post:**

*   The blog post details how the *dynamic* trait of AMF3 objects also allows for arbitrary object creation and setting of properties similar to JavaBeans, which can be abused.
*   The post mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited by using the `ysoserial` tool and a JRMP listener, which simplifies payload delivery for exploitation.
* The post references [JEP 290](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290) as a mitigation strategy that has already been implemented in some JDK versions.
* The affected libraries are: Flex BlazeDS (Adobe and Apache), Flamingo AMF Serializer, GraniteDS, WebORB for Java.
* It explains the differences between `java.io.Serializable` and `java.io.Externalizable`.
* It includes a proof of concept of the vulnerability using netcat and Flex BlazeDS.

**CVE-2017-3199 Specific Information:**

While the blog post doesn't focus solely on CVE-2017-3199, the CERT advisory lists CVE-2017-3199 as specifically affecting GraniteDS due to the insecure deserialization via `java.io.Externalizable` and improper handling of the AMF3 `externalizable` trait. The same vulnerability affects other libraries and are assigned other CVEs.
