    "CVE-2017-3738": {
      "root_cause": "An overflow bug exists in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli in OpenSSL.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially recover a private key, though analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA would be very difficult. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible.",
