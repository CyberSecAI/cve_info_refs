Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3887

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software's handling of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) packets. Specifically, when the system is configured with an SSL Decrypt-Resign policy, the Snort process can unexpectedly restart due to a flaw in processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of SSL packets leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an SSL Decrypt-Resign policy is enabled.
- The specific vulnerability is related to a memory issue (CWE-119).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The Snort process restarts unexpectedly, disrupting the Firepower System's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning it can be exploited remotely over a network.
- The attack requires high complexity (AC:H), meaning specific conditions must be met for a successful attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) to exploit this vulnerability.
- User interaction is not required (UI:N) for the attack to succeed.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted or malicious SSL packets to the vulnerable system with a Decrypt-Resign policy in place.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Firepower System Software prior to the first fixed release.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading to a patched software version.
- Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability was found during a Cisco TAC support case.
- The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 6.8, with the vector string being: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
