Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-3051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JPEG images within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, it's due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the JPEG parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The inadequate validation of user-supplied data leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory object. This can potentially leak sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information due to the out-of-bounds read.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** The advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve code execution in the context of the current process, although this is not the direct result of this specific vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction; the target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted JPEG image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file or webpage containing a specially crafted JPEG to the victim. This can be done through social engineering, serving the file from an attacker-controlled web server, or other methods.
