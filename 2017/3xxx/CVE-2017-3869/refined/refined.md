Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3869:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the APIs of Cisco Prime Infrastructure. Specifically, an authenticated user can access APIs that should be restricted to privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that the system does not enforce proper privilege checks on API calls, allowing lower-privileged users to access restricted functionalities.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of authorization checks on API endpoints which allow a low privileged user to access privileged endpoints.
*   **CWE-255:** The advisory also mentions CWE-255, which is "Credentials Management", suggesting that an issue with how API credentials are handled is the cause of the improper access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact (Low):**  An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Integrity Impact (Low):** An attacker could potentially modify data through the unauthorized API access.
*   **Availability Impact (None):** The vulnerability does not directly impact the availability of the service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (AV:N):** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **API Access:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the Cisco Prime Infrastructure APIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to make API requests.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Cisco Prime Infrastructure system over the network.
*   **Low Privileges (PR:L):** The attacker doesn't need to have admin or high-level privileges. A low privileged account is enough to exploit this vulnerability

**CVSS Score:**

*   **Base Score:** 5.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)
