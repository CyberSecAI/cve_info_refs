Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient resource handling in the web user interface of Cisco IOS XE Software when it experiences a high load.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient resource management by the web interface when under heavy load.
- Failure to properly handle a high volume of requests to the web user interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload.
- This reload results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, disrupting the availability of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a high number of requests to the web user interface of the affected software.
- The attacker must have network access to the management interface of the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the management interface of the affected Cisco IOS XE device.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to send these requests.
- Access to the management interface is typically through a restricted management network, implying a privileged position or network access.

**Additional Details:**
- The web UI is not enabled by default and must be specifically configured for the device to be vulnerable.
- The advisory provides commands to check if the web UI is enabled: `transport-map type persistent webui transport-map-name`, `transport type persistent webui input transport-map-name`, along with `ip http server` or `ip http secure-server`
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability, and there are no workarounds other than disabling the web user interface.
- The provided CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H`, with a base score of 8.6.
