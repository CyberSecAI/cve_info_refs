### What our Clients have to Say

“

Working with Depth was a real pleasure. Your PEN testing team was very thorough, you found things that have been in the network for 12 years that 10 or so PEN tests didn’t find. That’s crazy.

Chief Information OfficerFinancial Institution“

Very receptive and quick in communications throughout. If I had set expectations, I’d say they were exceeded. What I do have from our experience is appreciation for your professionalism and effort.

Vice President of SecurityFinancial Institution“

You guys have been phenomenal for us. It’s pretty rare to find a vendor that consistently delivers a polished product anymore.

Director of Enterprise CybersecurityHealth System“

As usual your team was outstanding to work with. I told the team here that they would see what a real Pen Testing partner can do. They were very impressed with the team and the work they did.

Chief Information Security OfficerHealthcare Organization“

The wealth of knowledge shared to improve our security posture continues to impress our team. The one plus that impresses our team is that we can reach out to inquiry about different security solutions in our environment to get your team’s feedback, which proves to be of great value. I have no recommendations to improve our experience or expectations.

Director of SecurityManufacturing Organization“

All of my engagements with Depth Security were met on time and within budget. I can confirm the professionalism, experience and wealth of knowledge they bring/display in the area of information security. I consider Depth Security a partner. You will be well served by any of their services. You will not be disappointed.

I will rate Depth Security a strong 5. Definitely recommended.

Response to a Client Reference Check“

I do want to say that the process with Depth has been great so far and we are very impressed with the detail and communication from Joe as well as the quality of the reports.

Director of Information TechnologySports & Recreation Organization“

We are satisfied with the thorough and detailed report. We also appreciated that your team worked independently without needing much of our time. It was a pleasure working with you, and we look forward to future opportunities.

Director of TechnologySoftware Organization“

We were very impressed and amazed by the services offered by your company. Your staff were very professional and were easy to work with and the reports were very well articulated and easy to understand. As a result of the audit, we have set in motion some policy changes specifically changing the password policy. It’s quite easy for companies like ours to be disconnected from the realities of the security realm and the audit helped us bridge that gap tremendously.

# Exploit Title: Adobe Coldfusion BlazeDS Java Object Deserialization RCE
# Date: February 6, 2018
# Exploit Author: Faisal Tameesh (@DreadSystems)
# Company: Depth Security (https://depthsecurity.com)
# Version: Adobe Coldfusion (11.0.03.292866)
# Tested On: Windows 10 Enterprise (10.0.15063)
# CVE: CVE-2017-3066
# Advisory: https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/coldfusion/apsb17-14.html

# Notes:
# This is a two-stage deserialization exploit. The code below is the first stage.
# You will need a JRMPListener (ysoserial) listening at callback_IP:callback_port.
# After firing this exploit, and once the target server connects back,
# JRMPListener will deliver the secondary payload for RCE.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
