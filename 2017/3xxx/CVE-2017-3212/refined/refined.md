Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is improper validation of SSL certificates by the Space Coast Credit Union (SCCU) mobile application for both Android and iOS platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.
- This vulnerability is classified as CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- The attacker can intercept network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- This can lead to the exposure of sensitive account information, including login credentials (username and password).
- Attackers could potentially modify network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- This can be achieved if the attacker is on the same network as the victim's device (e.g., a compromised Wi-Fi network, or a privileged network position).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the user's device.
- They must be able to intercept network traffic between the mobile app and the server.
- This often means being within Wi-Fi range or having control of the network infrastructure.
- No user interaction is needed beyond the user using the application on an affected network.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable versions are:
    - Android: version 2.1.0.1104 and earlier
    - iOS: version 2.2 and earlier
- The vulnerability was reported by Will Strafach of verify.ly.
- The CERT/CC vulnerability note is VU#556600
- The official CVE ID is CVE-2017-3212
- The vulnerability has not been fixed as of the reporting date.
- Workarounds are suggested, including avoiding untrusted networks and using the web site instead of the vulnerable mobile app.
