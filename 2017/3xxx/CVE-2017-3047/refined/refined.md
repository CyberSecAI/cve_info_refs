Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-3047:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the handling of Annotation objects in Adobe Acrobat and Reader. The application fails to validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability
- Lack of object existence validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute code within the context of the current user.
- This could lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: An attacker could craft a malicious PDF file that, when opened, would trigger the use-after-free condition.
- Malicious web page: The vulnerability can also be exploited via a malicious web page that targets the vulnerable application. User interaction is needed, as the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file or web page to the victim.
- The attacker does not need to be in the same network as the victim.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, either by opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page.
