{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The document mentions multiple vulnerabilities, including use-after-free, heap buffer overflows, memory corruption and integer overflows",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Memory corruption",
        "Integer overflow",
        "Vulnerabilities in the directory search path used to find resources"
    ],
    "impact": "These vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, and in some instances lead to a memory address leak.",
    "attack_vectors": "The document does not explicitly specify the attack vectors but mentions that successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system and may be achieved by opening a malicious PDF file.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to craft a malicious PDF file to exploit the vulnerability. The document also mentions vulnerabilities in directory search paths which could be exploited if attacker can influence the application to use specific resources."
