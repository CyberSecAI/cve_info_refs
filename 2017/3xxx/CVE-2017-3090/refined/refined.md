Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3090:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insecure library loading. Specifically, the application may be loading libraries from untrusted locations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Library Loading:** The application loads libraries without proper validation of their origin or integrity. This means that a malicious library could be loaded instead of the intended legitimate one.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation can lead to an attacker gaining higher privileges on the affected system. This could allow them to perform actions normally restricted to system administrators or other privileged users.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could place a malicious library in a location where Adobe Digital Editions will load it from. This could be a directory that the application searches by default or one that can be influenced by the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious library in a location that the vulnerable application will load from. This may require some level of access to the filesystem.
*   The attacker does not require any interaction from the user. The vulnerability is triggered during the application's library loading process.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability was reported anonymously.
*   The fix is to update to Adobe Digital Editions version 4.5.5.
*   This vulnerability affects Windows, Macintosh, iOS and Android platforms.
