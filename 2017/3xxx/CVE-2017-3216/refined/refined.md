Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication check for a critical function within a custom `httpd` plugin used by various WiMAX routers. This plugin is built on top of the MediaTek SDK library (`libmtk`).
*   The vulnerability is not present in the MediaTek SDK itself but introduced by downstream vendors who customize the SDK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-306:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function. The `commit2.cgi` script allows password reset without any prior authentication.
*   Authentication Bypass: A critical function (administrator password reset) can be accessed without prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full compromise of the router:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can reset the administrator password, gaining full control over the router.
*   **Complete access to router settings:** Once the attacker has admin access, they can change all settings, including network configuration, firewall rules, and potentially gain further access to the local network behind the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network requests.
*   **HTTP POST request:** Attackers send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `commit2.cgi` script.
*   **`ADMIN_PASSWD` variable:** The new administrator password is sent via the `ADMIN_PASSWD` POST variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote network access:** The attacker only requires network access to the vulnerable router. No prior authentication is required.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `commit2.cgi` script and the POST variable name `ADMIN_PASSWD`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Some affected devices have remote administration enabled by default, increasing the risk of exploitation by internet-based attackers.
*   The vulnerability is present in the custom `httpd` plugin, meaning it is a vendor-specific vulnerability.
*   MediaTek has confirmed that the vulnerability is not part of the original SDK, but is due to downstream customization by vendors.
*   Several vendors such as Huawei, ZTE, and ZyXEL have been identified as having vulnerable products.
*   Some affected products have reached "End of Service" and may not receive security updates.
