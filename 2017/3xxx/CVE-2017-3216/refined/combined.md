# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

## Various WiMAX routers contain a authentication bypass vulnerability in custom libmtk httpd plugin

#### Vulnerability Note VU#350135

Original Release Date: 2017-06-07 | Last Revised: 2017-07-24

---

### Overview

WiMAX routers from several vendors making use of a custom httpd plugin for libmtk are vulnerable to an authentication bypass allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to change the administrator password on the device.

### Description

| [**CWE-306**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function -** CVE-2017-3216  Several WiMAX routers making use of a custom httpd plugin for libmtk (the MediaTek SDK library) are vulnerable to an authentication bypass that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to change the administrator password on the device.By sending a crafted POST request to commit2.cgi, an unauthenticated, remote attacker may reset the administrator password by sending a new password in the POST ADMIN\_PASSWD variable.The reporter has identified the following model routers as being impacted; other models and firmware versions may also be impacted. The reporter notes that some devices have remote administration enabled by default, allowing an internet-based attacker to attempt this exploit.GreenPacket OX350 (Version: ?)GreenPacket OX-350 (Version: ?)Huawei BM2022 (Version: v2.10.14)Huawei HES-309M (Version: ?)Huawei HES-319M (Version: ?)Huawei HES-319M2W (Version: ?)Huawei HES-339M (Version: ?)MADA Soho Wireless Router (Version: v2.10.13)ZTE OX-330P (Version: ?)ZyXEL MAX218M (Version: 2.00(UXG.0)D0)ZyXEL MAX218M1W (Version: 2.00(UXE.3)D0)ZyXEL MAX218MW (Version: 2.00(UXD.2)D0)ZyXEL MAX308M (Version: 2.00(UUA.3)D0)ZyXEL MAX318M (Version: ?)ZyXEL MAX338M (Version: ?)The MediaTek SDK for device firmware may be customized by downstream vendors. According to MediaTek, the MediaTek SDK does not contain the vulnerable files and so the vulnerability was introduced downstream from the SDK. It is currently unclear at what point in the supply chain this vulnerability was introduced.For more information, please see the researcher's [blog post](http://blog.sec-consult.com/2017/06/ghosts-from-past-authentication-bypass.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may gain administrator access to the device after changing the administrator password on the device with a crafted POST request. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Consider the following workarounds instead. |
| --- |

| **Restrict network access**Restrict network access to the the router web interface to only trusted clients.**Disable WAN device management**Restrict network access to the router web interface from external connections. |
