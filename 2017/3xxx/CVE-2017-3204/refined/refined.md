Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3204:

**1. Verification of CVE relation:**

The content directly references CVE-2017-3204 and provides context and details regarding the vulnerability. Therefore, the content is **RELATED** to the CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package's `ClientConfig` struct had a default behavior where if the `HostKeyCallback` field was left unset, it would implicitly accept any host key from the server. This essentially disabled host key verification, making SSH client connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of Host Key Verification:** The primary weakness was the lack of mandatory host key verification. By default, the SSH client would not verify the server's identity.
*   **Trust on First Use (TOFU) Misimplementation:** While TOFU is a common practice, the library didn't implement it correctly. It was effectively trust on every use, without any caching or persistent storage of hostkeys which would allow for verification after the first connection.
*   **MITM Attack Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exposed clients to MITM attacks, allowing attackers to potentially intercept or manipulate communications.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is significant, as it can lead to:
    *   **Credentials theft**: Passwords or other credentials can be intercepted in connections using password or keyboard-interactive authentication.
    *   **Agent Forwarding Abuse**: If using public-key authentication with agent forwarding, an attacker can make the victim's agent sign requests for the real server after authenticating to the attacker's MITM server.
    *   **Impersonation**: Attackers can impersonate legitimate servers, particularly if public key authentication without agent forwarding is used, although this is more difficult to carry out unnoticed.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-level MITM:** Attackers can perform MITM attacks by intercepting network traffic between the client and server.
*   **DNS Spoofing:** Attackers can use DNS poisoning to redirect the client to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** Attackers need to be positioned on the network path between the client and server, or otherwise have the ability to redirect the client to a malicious server.
*   **Interception/Redirection Ability:** Attackers need to be able to intercept or redirect network traffic to perform the MITM attack.
*  **No previous interaction required**: The vulnerability does not require any prior interaction or exploit. The client will connect insecurely automatically, making it easy to exploit.

**Additional information from the content:**

*   **Vendor Response:** One tooling vendor considered the lack of host key checking "Not A Bug" and updated documentation to reflect this, highlighting that they did not support host key checking. This was deemed deeply concerning by the author.
*   **Go Maintainer Response:** The Golang maintainers addressed the issue by making a breaking change in the `x/crypto/ssh` package. They changed the default behavior to reject all host keys when `HostKeyCallback` is not set. They also added `InsecureIgnoreHostKey()` for users who explicitly want to disable host key checks, and `FixedHostKey()` for verifying against a specific host key.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix to the library forces developers to explicitly implement a host key verification method when using the `x/crypto/ssh` package as an SSH client. The `FixedHostKey` example shows an easy way to solve the issue with an approach similar to the SSH client config `known_hosts` file.
*   **Vendoring Issues:** The author discusses how vendoring libraries could potentially embed vulnerabilities deeper, making it harder to fix them across the ecosystem, in contrast to the fix made by the Go team that forced a breaking change but increased security.

In conclusion, CVE-2017-3204 stems from a lack of mandatory host key verification in the Go SSH library, making it highly vulnerable to MITM attacks. The content provides significant detail beyond the typical CVE description.
