{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities were identified, including use-after-free, heap buffer overflows, memory corruption, integer overflows, and issues in the directory search path used to find resources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Memory corruption",
      "Integer overflow",
      "Insecure directory search path"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. Some memory corruption vulnerabilities could also lead to memory address leaks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The document doesn't specify the exact attack vectors, but it implies that specially crafted files could trigger these vulnerabilities when processed by Adobe Acrobat or Reader.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to deliver a malicious PDF or similar file to a target running a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader. The specific actions required to trigger the vulnerabilities are not detailed in the document."
