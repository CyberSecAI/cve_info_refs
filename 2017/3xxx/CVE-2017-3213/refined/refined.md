Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3213:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Think Mutual Bank mobile banking app for iOS fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper certificate validation (CWE-295)
- The app does not verify the authenticity of the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the server, allowing it to connect to a malicious server presenting a fake certificate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- Sensitive account information, such as login credentials (username and password) can be intercepted.

**Attack vectors:**
- A physically proximate attacker (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network).
- An attacker in a privileged network position.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's iOS device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the victim's device and the legitimate server.
- The attacker needs to be able to generate a fake SSL/TLS certificate.
