Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a format string issue within the DHCP code of the Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) feature in Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Routers. This occurs when the device processes a specially crafted DHCP packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Format string vulnerability in the DHCP handling logic.
- Lack of proper input sanitization of DHCP packets during the ZTP process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the affected device to reload. This disrupts network services and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted DHCP packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected device on the DHCP server port. This would mean that the device is listening on the DHCP server port (UDP port 67).

**Additional Details:**
- The affected devices are Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Routers running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- The devices are vulnerable only when listening on the DHCP server port (which is not the default).
- A crashinfo file is generated upon exploitation, which can be reviewed by the Cisco TAC to confirm the exploit.
- The device may crash with the message "UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = DHCPD Receive."
- Cisco has released software updates to fix this vulnerability.
- No workarounds are available.
- The CVSS score is 8.6 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)
