Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-3043:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `Collab.shareFile` function within Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper File Path Checking:** The `Collab.shareFile` function does not properly validate the file path when a PDF file is opened from the cloud. This lack of validation allows the reading of arbitrary memory locations.
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the ability to read arbitrary memory, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary memory locations, potentially leaking sensitive information.
- **Code Execution (Indirect):** The advisory mentions that the information disclosure vulnerability could be leveraged "in conjunction with other vulnerabilities" to achieve code execution. This suggests that this vulnerability by itself does not allow for arbitrary code execution, but it can serve as a building block for more serious exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires the victim to either:
  - Visit a malicious web page.
  - Open a specially crafted malicious PDF file.
- **Cloud based files:** The vulnerability is triggered when a PDF is opened from the Cloud.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Malicious PDF or Web Content:** An attacker needs to craft either a malicious PDF file or a malicious website that triggers the vulnerable `Collab.shareFile` function.
- **No Special Access:** The attacker does not need special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, the primary requirement is to convince the user to interact with the malicious resource.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by AbdulAziz Hariri of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe released security updates to address this vulnerability in their products.
- The advisory also mentions that this vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that could lead to a memory address leak
