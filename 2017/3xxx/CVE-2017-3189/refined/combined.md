## dotCMS contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#168699

Original Release Date: 2017-03-06 | Last Revised: 2017-03-07

---

### Overview

The dotCMS administration panel is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, and the "Push Publishing" feature in Enterprise Pro is vulnerable to path traversal and arbitrary file upload. dotCMS versions 3.7.1 and earlier are affected.

### Description

| [**CWE-352**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/353.html)**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - CVE-2017-3187  The dotCMS administrator panel contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request.[**CWE-22**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** - CVE-2017-3188 When "Bundle" tar.gz archives uploaded to the Push Publishing feature are decompressed, the filenames of its contents are not properly checked, allowing for writing files to arbitrary directories on the file system. These archives may be uploaded directly via the administrator panel, or using the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2017-3187) described above.[**CWE-434**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** - CVE-2017-3189When "Bundle" tar.gz archives uploaded to the Push Publishing feature are decompressed, there are no checks on the types of files which the bundle contains. This vulnerability combined with the path traversal vulnerability above (CVE-2017-3188) can lead to remote command execution with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker may perform actions with the dotCMS administrator panel with the same permissions of a victim user or execute arbitrary system commands with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Do not browse to untrusted sites**Administrators can mitigate CSRF vulnerabilities in browser based tools by not browsing to untrusted websites while logged into their account. |
