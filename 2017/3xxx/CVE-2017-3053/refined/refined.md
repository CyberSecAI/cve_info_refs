Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located within the JPEG processing functionality of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. It arises due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling JPEG images, which leads to a read operation past the end of an allocated memory object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the program attempts to access memory outside the designated buffer.
- Lack of proper input validation: The root cause is the inadequate validation of user-supplied data within the JPEG processing module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information due to the out-of-bounds read. An attacker could potentially read data beyond the intended boundaries of the allocated buffer.
- Potential for further exploitation: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability could be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The vulnerability is exploitable by remote attackers.
- Malicious File/Page: Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically, the user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JPEG file or serve a malicious web page containing a crafted JPEG image.
- The attacker would also require the victim to open the crafted file or visit the malicious page using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.

**Additional details from the second source:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Adobe Acrobat and Reader updates released on April 6, 2017, specifically in versions 2017.009.20044 (Continuous track) and 2015.006.30306 (Classic track).
- It is listed as a memory corruption vulnerability that could lead to a memory address leak.
- The vulnerability was reported by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
