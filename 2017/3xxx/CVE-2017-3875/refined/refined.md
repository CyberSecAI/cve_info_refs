Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-3875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within certain access-control filtering mechanisms on Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability allows for a bypass of traffic filtering configured within an Access Control List (ACL).
*   Specifically, it is a CWE-20 vulnerability, which refers to "Improper Input Validation". This indicates the filtering mechanism is not properly validating input, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could bypass the defined traffic restrictions specified in the ACL on the affected system.
*   The impact is rated as "Low" for integrity, meaning an attacker can potentially modify data in transit. There is no impact on confidentiality or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack can be performed remotely over a network (AV:N).
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L), indicating that the attack is not difficult to execute.
*   No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N).
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).
*   The vulnerability can impact components beyond the directly affected resource (S:C - Scope Changed).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switch.

**Summary**
The vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass configured access control lists, leading to potential integrity issues by manipulating network traffic.
