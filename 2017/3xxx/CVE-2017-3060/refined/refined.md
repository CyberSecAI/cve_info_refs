Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of SWF files. This improper validation can lead to a read past the end of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read within the SWF parsing process of Adobe Flash Player, due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data.
- **Memory Corruption:**  The vulnerability is described as a memory corruption vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is within the SWF parsing functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially disclose sensitive information via out-of-bounds memory read.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Application Crash:** The vulnerability can lead to application crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SWF File:** Attackers create specially crafted SWF files that, when processed by a vulnerable version of Flash Player, trigger the out-of-bounds read.
- **Web Browsing:** The attack is triggered when a victim visits a malicious website or opens a malicious file that contains the crafted SWF file using a vulnerable Flash Player.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SWF file to a user. This can be achieved through:
    - Embedding the SWF file on a malicious webpage.
    - Delivering the SWF file as part of an email attachment or download.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerability to create the crafted SWF files.
-  The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- User interaction is required as the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
