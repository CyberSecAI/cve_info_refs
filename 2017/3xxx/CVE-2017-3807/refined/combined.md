Affected Products  * Vulnerable Cisco ASA Software running on the following products may be affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Cisco ASA for Firepower 9300 Series   + Cisco ASA for Firepower 4100 Series   + Cisco ISA 3000 Industrial Security ApplianceRefer to the "Fixed Software" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected releases.   Vulnerable Products   Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled. To determine whether the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled, the administrator can verify the following:   + *webvpn* is enabled on at least one interface.   + The group policy includes the *ssl-clientless* option configured in the **vpn-tunnel-protocol** command.To determine whether *webvpn* is enabled, use the **show running-config webvpn**   command.   The following example shows a Cisco ASA with the Clientless SSL VPN portal enabled on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn    webvpn    enable outside    [...]      ``` To determine whether the *ssl-clientless* option is configured in the **vpn-tunnel-protocol** command, use the **show running-config group-policy  attributes | include vpn-tunnel-protocol** command. The following example shows a policy called **Clientless** with *ssl-clientless* option configured the **vpn-tunnel-protocol** command. ```   ciscoasa# show running-config group-policy Clientless attributes | include vpn-tunnel-protocol   vpn-tunnel-protocol ssl-client ssl-clientless   ``` If the **vpn-tunnel-protocol** command options are not specified in the group policy, Cisco ASA inherits the options from the default group policy called *DfltGrpPolicy.* By default, the *DfltGrpPolicy* has the *ssl-clientless* option enabled.      **Note**: Cisco ASA configured with a Cisco AnyConnect Essential license is not affected by this vulnerability. Determining the Running Software VersionTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can use the **show version** command. The following example shows the results of the **show version** command on an appliance running Cisco ASA Software version 9.2(1): ```   ciscoasa# show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1) Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ``` Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco Firepower Threat Defense Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * It is possible to block the offending URL using a webtype access list, which can be performed using the following steps:   1. Configure the webtype access list:    ```   access-list bugCSCvc23838 webtype deny url https://*/+webvpn+/CIFS_R/*access-list bugCSCvc23838 webtype permit url https://*access-list bugCSCvc23838 webtype permit url cifs://*   ``` The second and third access-list will allow any other HTTPS and CIFS traffic. Administrator should review their configuration and adapt this access list based on their access policy.   7. Apply the access list in the group policy with the **filter value**  command:    ```   group-policy Clientless attributes webvpn  filter value bugCSCvc23838   ```  Fixed Software  * In the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco   ASA Software. The right column indicates whether a major release is   affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.      | **Cisco ASA Major Release** | **First Fixed Release** |   | --- | --- |   | Prior to 9.01 | Affected, migrate to 9.1(7.13) or later |   | 9.01 | Affected, migrate to 9.1(7.13) or later |   | 9.1 | 9.1(7.13) or later |   | 9.22 | Affected, migrate to 9.4(4) or later |   | 9.31 | Affected, migrate to 9.4(4) or later |   | 9.4 | 9.4(4) or later |   | 9.52 | Affected, migrate to 9.6(2.10) or later |   | 9.6 | 9.6(2.10) or later |   | 9.7 | Not affected |               1Cisco ASA Software releases prior to 9.1 and Cisco ASA release 9.3 have reached End of Software Maintenance.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent AV:Â Network AV:Â Physical  Attack Complexity AC:Â Low AC:Â High  Privileges Required PR:Â None PR:Â Low PR:Â High  User Interaction UI:Â Required UI:Â None  Scope S:Â Unchanged S:Â Changed  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Low C:Â High  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Low I:Â High  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Low A:Â High     Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:Â Unknown  RC:Â Reasonable  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â High   Integrity Requirement IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â High   Availability Requirement AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â High   Modified Attack Vector MAV:Â Local  MAV:Â Adjacent  MAV:Â Network  MAV:Â Physical  MAV:Â Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC:Â Low  MAC:Â High  MAC:Â Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR:Â None  MPR:Â Low  MPR:Â High  MPR:Â Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI:Â Required  MUI:Â None  MUI:Â Not Defined   Modified Scope MS:Â Unchanged  MS:Â Changed  MS:Â Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC:Â None  MC:Â Low  MC:Â High  MC:Â Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI:Â None  MI:Â Low  MI:Â High  MI:Â Not Defined   Modified Availability MA:Â None  MA:Â Low  MA:Â High  MA:Â Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.8 |

# Cisco ASA - WebVPN CIFS Handling Buffer Overflow

#### EDB-ID:

###### 41369

#### CVE:

###### [2017-3807](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3807)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Hardware](/?platform=hardware)

#### Date:

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=998

The WebVPN http server exposes a way of accessing files from CIFS with a url hook of the form: https://portal/+webvpn+/CIFS_R/share_server/share_name/file.

When someone logged into the portal navigates to such an address, the http_cifs_process_path function parses the request URI and creates 2 C strings in a http_cifs_context struct:

http_cifs_context:
  +0x160 char* file_dir
  +0x168 char* file_name

These strings are copied in various places, but is done incorrectly. For example, in ewaURLHookCifs, there is the following pseudocode:

   filename_copy_buf = calloc(1LL, 336LL);
   net_handle[10] = filename_copy_buf;
   if ( filename_copy_buf )
   {
     src_len = _wrap_strlen(filename_from_request);
     if ( filename_from_request[src_len - 1] == ('|') )
     {
       // wrong length (src length)
       strncpy((char *)filename_copy_buf, filename_from_request,
               src_len - 1);
     }

In this case, a fixed size buf (|filename_copy_buf|) is allocated. Later, strncpy is called to copy to it, but the length passed is the length of the src string, which can be larger than 366 bytes. This leads to heap overflow.

There appear to be various other places where the copying is done in an unsafe way:

http_cifs_context_to_name, which is called from ewaFile{Read,Write,Get}Cifs, and ewaFilePost, uses strcat to copy the file path and file name to a fixed size (stack) buffer.

http_cifs_pre_fopen, which has a similar issue with passing the length of the src buffer to strncpy.

Possibly http_add_query_str_from_context. There are probably others that I missed.

Note that triggering this bug requires logging in to the WebVPN portal first, but the cifs share does not need to exist.

Repro:

Login to WebVPN portal, navigate to:

https://portal/+webvpn+/CIFS_R/server/name/ followed by 500 'A's.

("server" and "name" may be passed verbatim)

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
