Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3803:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a memory leak in the Cisco IOS Software forwarding queue when processing specific IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets. The switch fails to free allocated memory, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak in software forwarding queue.
- Improper handling of IPv6 ND packets.
- Inability to release allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A partial Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
- High CPU utilization.
- Software forwarding features become unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- An adjacent attacker can send specifically crafted IPv6 ND packets to trigger the memory leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be adjacent to the vulnerable Cisco switch.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted IPv6 ND packets.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Cisco IOS Software for Catalyst 2960X and 3750X switches.
- A workaround involves disabling the configuration that forces software forwarding, but a switch reload is required to recover the leaked memory.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.7 with the vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L
- There are no known public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
