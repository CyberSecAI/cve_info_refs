Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Cisco Firepower System Software that allows a bypass of web content blocking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The advisory explicitly mentions CWE-20, indicating that the software fails to properly validate or sanitize input related to web content filtering, thus leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the intended web content filtering mechanisms of the Cisco Firepower appliance. This could allow users to access blocked or restricted content, potentially leading to further security breaches or policy violations.
*   **Limited Impact (CVSS: C:L/I:N/A:N):** The CVSS score indicates that the vulnerability has a low impact on confidentiality (C:L), no impact on integrity (I:N), and no impact on availability (A:N). This suggests the exploit primarily circumvents filtering but doesn't directly lead to data exposure, modification, or service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network, making it remotely accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated, Remote Attacker (PR:N):** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, highlighting its ease of access.
*   **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** The attacker does not need any user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Cisco Firepower System Software.
*   No workarounds are available, requiring users to apply the fixed software.
*   The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 5.8, classified as medium severity.
*   The scope of the vulnerability is considered "Changed" (S:C), meaning that an exploit can affect resources beyond the initial vulnerable component.

In summary, CVE-2017-3814 involves a web content filtering bypass vulnerability in Cisco Firepower System Software, exploitable remotely by unauthenticated attackers without user interaction. The primary impact is the circumvention of intended security filtering, with limited direct impact on data confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
