Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the login form of the Inmarsat AmosConnect 8 (AC8) mail client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-89 (Blind SQL Injection):** The login form is susceptible to blind SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries without seeing the results directly, but being able to infer results by observing application behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain access to user names and passwords stored in the application's internal database. This access could potentially allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive email data, or gain unauthorized access to other shipboard systems depending on the permissions of the compromised accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through network access to the AmosConnect Server. This means the attacker needs to have network connectivity to the server hosting the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the network where the AmosConnect server is running. This could be a ship's network, or a network that has access to the ship's network.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
