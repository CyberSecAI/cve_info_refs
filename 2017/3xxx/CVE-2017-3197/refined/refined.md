    "source": "github.com_fdfbe003_20250124_125342.html",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The SmiFlash SWSMI handler in the UEFI firmware from American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) does not validate input pointers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode (SMM). They can also install a backdoor to the system at a firmware level which persists across operating system reinstalls. Additionally, this vulnerability could be used to bypass UEFI firmware security mechanisms.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send malicious requests to the vulnerable SMI handler from ring-0 (kernel mode).",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to achieve ring-0 execution, which can be obtained through a kernel vulnerability or a vulnerable 3rd party driver. They then need to send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable SMI handler."

(AMI) firmware does not enroll in the necessary protection mechanisms (BIOSWE, BLE, SMM_BWP, and SPI Protect Ranges) to prevent unauthorized writes to the SPI flash."
