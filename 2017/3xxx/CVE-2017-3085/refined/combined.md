# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Playing in the Remote Sandbox: Adobe Flash Windows User Credentials Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2017-3085)

Aug 8, 2017

Recently, I posted a writeup on a Flash sandbox escape flaw that ultimately led to the demise of Flash Playerâs decade-old local security sandbox. This post is a follow up.

Tracked as [CVE-2016-4271](/2017/02/flash-bypassing-local-sandbox-data-exfiltration-credentials-leak/), the former flaw highlights the importance of proper input validation. Feeding the Flash runtime a mixture of UNC and File URI schemes turned out sufficient to [exfiltrate local data](/2017/02/flash-bypassing-local-sandbox-data-exfiltration-credentials-leak/#whats-in-a-scheme-exfiltrating-local-data), and [disclose Windows user credentials](/2017/02/flash-bypassing-local-sandbox-data-exfiltration-credentials-leak/#smb-at-play-leaking-windows-user-credentials) to a remote SMB server.

Flash Player 23 dropped the `local-with-filesystem` sandbox, effectively solving both issues from the local perspective. Interestingly though, the [release notes](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2209269 "9/13/2016 - Release - Flash Player 23 | Adobe Community") quietly disregarded the two remaining sandboxes - `local-with-networking` and `remote` - leaving me to wonder whether these had been patched as well.

Indeed, initial tests show Flash rejects any UNC or File-style paths. By extension, neither sandbox seems to accept any non-HTTP URLs. Hence, this raises the obvious question of interest: what if we approach this issue the other way around? Can we change input expression meaning *after* having passed input validation?

In short, Adobe Flash can be rendered susceptible to a known Windows vulnerability. Albeit partially mitigated by a runtime security measure, the latter was designed for a different purpose, and can therefore be circumvented. These two facts combined turn out sufficient to workaround Flash Playerâs new input validation, restoring an attackerâs ability to obtain Windows user credentials.

This post is a writeup on a flaw I recently reported to Adobe, acknowledged in [APSB17-23](https://web.archive.org/web/20201210080405/https%3A//helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb17-23.html), and assigned [CVE-2017-3085](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3085).

### HTTP: Canât Redirect This

To reiterate, key to exploiting the previous flaw is having our malicious Flash application connect to our SMB server. By denying access without authentication, the server then triggers Windows clients to conveniently send their user credentials.

Adobe seems well aware of this attack vector. While previously Flash would load resources from any SMB server, version 23 rejects any [UNC and File-style paths](/2017/02/flash-bypassing-local-sandbox-data-exfiltration-credentials-leak/#by-definition-not-so-local) - two schemes used to reference SMB hosts. Example paths now being rejected include, respectively, `\\10.0.0.1\some\file.txt` and the equivalent `file://///10.0.0.1/some/file.txt`.

Unfortunately, taking [Microsoftâs URI list](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/reserved-uri-scheme-names) for some creative URL generation does not yield any results. In neither sandbox, `URLLoader` appears to accept any paths not being prefixed by either HTTP or HTTPS. It seems Adobe has stepped up their game by switching to a whitelist approach.

Now, what if we could change the requested path *after* having passed input validation? Seeing as we are restricted to HTTP, this would translate to leveraging HTTP redirection for accessing SMB hosts.

Fortunately, SMB and HTTP are not an unlikely combination. Immediately coming to mind is a Windows vulnerability known as [Redirect-to-SMB](https://www.cylance.com/content/dam/cylance/pdfs/white_papers/redirect-to-smb-20151012.pdf). By setting the HTTP `Location` header and an appropriate response code (e.g. 301, 302), this vulnerability can be used to redirect HTTP requests to a malicious SMB server. An attack can be executed as shown in the following screenshot:

![rdr2smb_httpresponse](https://blog.bjornweb.nl/resources/rdr2smb_httpresponse.png)

### Susceptible, or is it?

In our attacker scenario, the malicious Flash application as well as SMB server are hosted on a machine having the IP address `23.100.122.2`. This Flash application runs on the victimâs local machine in the `remote` sandbox. That is, the runtime prohibits local file system access but allows remote connections.

Tracing back to the Win32 API, the [functions affected by Redirect-to-SMB](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/672268) reside in `urlmon.dll`. Hence, Internet Explorer and any third-party applications using them are vulnerable.

Having generated quite some media attention, the vulnerability triggered many vendors to patch up their products. So, what about Adobe Flash? Attempting to redirect an outbound `GET /somefile.txt` request gives:

![rdr2smb_httpresponse](https://blog.bjornweb.nl/resources/secerror2032.png)
Figure 2. URLLoader output when redirecting victim to SMB

Code #2032 is Flash terminology for *Stream Error*. From last time, we know anything but #2048 may indicate success. Letâs see what actually happens:

![rdr2smb_httpresponse](https://blog.bjornweb.nl/resources/fail_clipped.png)
Figure 3. Wireshark trace for initial attempt

Alas, it seems Flash Player is not susceptible - our `HTTP/1.1 302` response does not trigger SMB traffic. However, notice there is a `GET` request for `crossdomain.xml`. Dubbed the [cross-domain policy file](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/adobe-media-server/articles/cross-domain-xml-for-streaming.html), it dictates when a Flash client is allowed to load resources from a different domain other than the originating one. For example, if not explicitly allowed by *domain-b.com*, the runtime will not load images from that domain if the Flash application is hosted on *domain-a.com*.

The careful reader might notice that Adobeâs definition, unlike [HTTP CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#terminology) (referencing [RFC6454](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-5)), restricts itself to *cross-domain* data handling. More specifically, it does not take into account differing *protocols*. This security mechanism should therefore be unrelated to our blocked attack: we are trying to redirect to SMB, a different protocol, on the same host ;-).

Interestingly however, our Wireshark trace seemingly suggests otherwise: `crossdomain.xml` is being requested from the same host that serves our Flash application. Hence, we proceed by constructing a least-restrictive cross-domain policy. Taking the syntax from Adobeâs developer guide, we have:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM "http://www.adobe.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd">
<cross-domain-policy>
    <site-control permitted-cross-domain-policies="all"/>
    <allow-access-from domain="*" secure="false"/>
    <allow-http-request-headers-from domain="*" headers="*" secure="false"/>
</cross-domain-policy>
```

Finally, we reload our Flash application and observe what happens:

![rdr2smb_httpresponse](https://blog.bjornweb.nl/resources/success.png)
Figure 4. Wireshark trace after consuming crossdomain.xml

Success! We have established an SMB connection from the victimâs machine (23.100.122.3) to our remote server (23.100.122.2). From here, we simply reiterate [what we did last time](/2017/02/flash-bypassing-local-sandbox-data-exfiltration-credentials-leak/#smb-at-play-leaking-windows-user-credentials). A Python script called *SMBTrap* operates as our malicious SMB server, and captures any incoming requests along with the victimâs user credentials:

![smbtrap_output](https://blog.bjornweb.nl/resources/smbtrap_usercred_only.png)
Figure 5. SMBTrap output

### A word about affected environments

Interestingly, and in contrast to the previous flaw, Edge as well as Chrome (with Flash enabled) are unaffected. While otherwise showing similar behavior, including a cross-domain policy file request, both browsers appear to prevent Flash from connecting to SMB hosts.

That said, Firefox as well as Internet Explorer *are* vulnerable. This also applies to all current versions of Microsoft Office. In addition, the flaw affects both `remote` and `local-with-networking` sandboxes.

### Conclusion

Having introduced new input validation measures, Flash Player 23 minimizes potential attack vectors by rejecting any outbound requests for non-HTTP URLs. Quite unexpectedly, however, input validation is only done once: while the initial HTTP request is validated, consecutive redirects are not. Combined with the fact Flash is still susceptible to a known Windows vulnerability therefore effectively kills a seemingly solid approach. This is unfortunate, and perhaps once again illustrates the underlying problem that platform-specific vulnerabilities need to be taken into account whenever possible.

Flash Player 26.0.0.151 fixes this issue, and can be downloaded through Windows Update and [Adobeâs website](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/).

One of Tuesday’s Flash Player patches was a do-over after the researcher who privately reported the problem earlier this year discovered the original patch incompletely resolved the issue.

One of the patches included in Tuesday’s Adobe [Flash Player update](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb17-23.html) was a do-over after the researcher who privately reported the problem earlier this year discovered the original patch incompletely resolved the issue.

Dutch researcher Bjorn Ruytenberg [disclosed details](https://blog.bjornweb.nl/2017/08/flash-remote-sandbox-escape-windows-user-credentials-leak/) after Adobe updated the soon-to-be deprecated Flash Player on Tuesday to version 26. Flash Player 23, released close to a year ago, closed off a local sandbox escape, but Ruytenberg found the update failed to address the vulnerability locally if networking was enabled, or remotely.

Exploiting the vulnerability would allow an attacker to connect a compromised computer to an attacker’s remote Windows SMB server. An attack allows for the redirection of traffic to the remote SMB server and the interception of Windows credentials.

“The attack complexity is very low,” Ruytenberg told Threatpost.

The researcher pointed out that an attacker could use any number of typical infection vectors to infect victims’ machines, including hosting a site that serves a malicious Flash application, or by embedding a Flash file in an Office document. Attackers could also hit victims via email or Windows file sharing by enticing them to open a local HTML file that embeds the malicious Flash application.

“In this scenario, the Flash application would run in the ‘local-with-networking’ as opposed to the default ‘remote sandbox (but both sandboxes are vulnerable),” Ruytenberg said.

In Flash 23, Adobe updated its sandbox policies, improving input validation along the way, which should have prevented Flash from connected to a remote server. Ruytenberg discovered that he could use a two-year-old Windows redirect-to-SMB vulnerability to again exploit the Flash bug. The attack works only on Internet Explorer and Firefox, Ruytenberg said; Chrome and Microsoft Edge are not affected, he said, preventing Flash from connecting to the SMB server.

Ruytenberg said in Flash 23, Adobe no longer allowed the software to load resources from an SMB server, rejecting UNC and File-style paths; any paths that are not prefixed with HTTP or HTTPS. Ruytenberg discovered that he could change the requested path after it had passed input validation by abusing the Redirect-to-SMB bug.

“By setting the HTTP Location header and an appropriate response code (e.g. 301, 302), this vulnerability can be used to redirect HTTP requests to a malicious SMB server,” he wrote in his report, adding that the vulnerability affects IE, Firefox and any third-party applications using them.

Specifically, Ruytenberg’s attack was able to abuse Flash’s cross-domain policy file which, he said, dictates when Flash is allowed to load resources from another domain. He discovered that the cross-domain policy is requested from the same host serving the attacker’s Flash application. Therefore, he built a new policy with lesser restrictions and was successful in forcing Flash to connect to the remote SMB server and capture incoming requests including the victim’s user credentials.

“The report I disclosed demonstrates this vulnerability was fixed improperly as the new sandbox policies can be circumvented,” Ruytenberg said. “This week’s patch should indeed fix the vulnerability.”

Adobe addressed the vulnerability, CVE-2017-3085, Tuesday, giving it a severity rating of important and calling it a security bypass vulnerability. It was one of two vulnerabilities addressed in Tuesday’s update.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
