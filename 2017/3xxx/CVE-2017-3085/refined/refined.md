{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the failure to properly apply sandbox rules when following a URL redirect. Specifically, Flash Player does not validate the redirected URL after the initial HTTP request, allowing a redirect to a malicious SMB server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation, Security bypass, Information Disclosure. The vulnerability leverages a known Windows vulnerability called Redirect-to-SMB.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to steal credentials under the context of the current user. This includes Windows user credentials. It can also potentially lead to arbitrary code execution (see CVE-2017-3106).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to host a malicious Flash application. This can be done by: hosting a site with the malicious SWF file, embedding a Flash file in an Office document, or by enticing users to open a local HTML file embedding the malicious Flash application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a web server and a malicious SMB server, and must trick the user into loading a specially crafted SWF file."
