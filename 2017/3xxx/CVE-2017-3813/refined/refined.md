Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Start Before Logon (SBL) module of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows. Specifically, a flaw allows an attacker to leverage the SBL functionality to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The core weakness is the ability for an unauthenticated local user to escalate their privileges to that of the SYSTEM user.
- **Improper Access Control:** The SBL module does not properly restrict access to certain functionalities, allowing an attacker to open Internet Explorer (or other browsers like Chrome) with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** By gaining SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can fully control the affected machine. This includes installing malware, accessing sensitive data, modifying system settings, and adding/removing users, potentially leading to data breaches, complete system takeover and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable Windows machine.
- **Start Before Logon (SBL) Enabled:** The Cisco AnyConnect client must have the SBL feature configured and enabled. The `UseStartBeforeLogon` option in the client's profile XML must be set to 'true'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of Windows operating systems.
- No prior authentication is needed for successful exploitation.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the Windows logon screen.
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the Cisco AnyConnect application.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit involves starting the Cisco AnyConnect client from the logon screen, then using a key combination (CTRL+B) to open the "About" window. From the "About" window the URL at the bottom can be selected, and that opens Internet Explorer (or Chrome) with SYSTEM privileges. The attacker can then use a browser to navigate the file system and execute programs (such as `cmd.exe`) with SYSTEM privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The SBL module is not installed by default.
- The `UseStartBeforeLogon` option is set to true by default.
- The vulnerability affects only Windows versions of the Cisco AnyConnect client when configured for SBL.
- There are no known workarounds. Cisco recommends updating to a patched version.
- The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Thomas Toth.
- The exploit details have been published on Exploit-DB.
