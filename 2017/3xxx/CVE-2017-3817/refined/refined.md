Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the role-based resource checking functionality of Cisco UCS Director.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control and insufficient resource checking within the role-based system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated remote attacker can view unauthorized information for any virtual machine within the UCS domain.
- The impact is described as limited in terms of confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the Cisco UCS Director system.
- The attacker has to be remote (network access).

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass the intended role-based resource checking in Cisco UCS Director and access sensitive information about virtual machines. The attacker needs a valid account on the system to perform this action. This is an information disclosure issue, with the potential to expose details about virtual machines beyond the authorized user's scope, but not impacting availability of the affected services.
