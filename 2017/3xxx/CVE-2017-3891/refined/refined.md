  "cveId": "CVE-2017-3891",
  "date": "2017-12",
  "description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists within the QNX Qnet protocol due to improper resolution of read permission restrictions by the remote resource manager.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Improper resolution of read permission restrictions of operations executed over Qnet by the remote resource manager.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Qnet protocol does not properly enforce read permission restrictions when accessing resources remotely.",
       "Lack of authentication and integrity checks for incoming connections, allowing for user ID forgery.",
        "Reliance on local file system permissions which are bypassed by the vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows for arbitrary read access on remote Qnet nodes, as well as local privilege escalation by accessing restricted files locally via a remote Qnet initiated request.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via Qnet network connections.",
      "Local exploitation by initiating a file read request through Qnet from a remote node back to the local system."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": [
      "For remote exploitation, an attacker needs access to a QNX machine connected to the Qnet subnet.",
      "For local privilege escalation, an attacker needs to be able to execute a command on another Qnet node, which could be done by already having access to it, or by using the Qnet network service"
    ],
      "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability can be exploited regardless of *maproot* or *mapany* settings and highlights that Qnet's design inherently breaks QNX's permission model.  It is recommended to disable Qnet or to use it only among mutually trusted, air-gapped nodes."
