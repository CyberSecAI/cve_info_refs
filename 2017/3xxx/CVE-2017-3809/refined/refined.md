Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the *Policy* deployment module of the Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Rule Set Deployment:** The core issue is that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to prevent the FMC from deploying a complete and accurate rule base. This means that the security policies intended to protect the network may not be fully implemented or correctly enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Security Posture:** The most significant impact is the inability of the FMC to fully enforce security policies. This can leave networks vulnerable to attacks due to missing or incomplete rules. 
*   **Disruption of Network Security:** An incomplete rule set might lead to unexpected behavior of the network, potentially allowing unauthorized traffic or activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is classified as "Network" (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated, Remote Access:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability and can initiate the attack remotely. This means that an attacker can potentially compromise the system without possessing valid user credentials or being present within the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified with CWE-20 which refers to Improper Input Validation.
*   The CVSS score is 5.8 with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N which indicates a medium severity vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability allows for a change in scope (S:C) meaning it can affect resources beyond the vulnerable component.
*   The vulnerability has an Integrity Impact that is low (I:L) which means there is some potential for modification to data but this is limited.
*   There is no Confidentiality Impact (C:N) or Availability Impact (A:N) which means that there is no impact to these areas.
