Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3028:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIFF images within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing TIFF images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability is present. This occurs because the software does not properly validate user-supplied data, leading to a write operation beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could potentially allow the attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The target user needs to interact with the malicious content, either by visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted TIFF image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious TIFF image file or a malicious link to the victim.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
- User interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2017-01-03, and a coordinated public release of the advisory took place on 2017-04-11.
- Adobe has released an update to address the vulnerability.
-  Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '27160'.
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- The vulnerability is also listed in the Adobe security bulletin APSB17-11, which covers multiple CVEs.
- The security bulletin also mentions that the updates address vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution, including use-after-free, heap buffer overflow, and memory corruption vulnerabilities.

This information provides more details than the basic CVE description, specifying that the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to improper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of TIFF images, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
