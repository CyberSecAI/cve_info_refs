Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3828

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*  The vulnerability lies within the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager. It is caused by insufficient input sanitization and output encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface. This is categorized as CWE-79.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager web-based management interface into clicking a crafted link.
*   Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking: The attacker could steal the user's session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the application with the user's permissions.
    *   Data theft: The attacker can potentially access or modify sensitive data displayed on the management interface.
    *   Malware distribution: The attacker can redirect the user to malicious websites or trigger downloads of harmful files.
    *   Defacement: An attacker could alter the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, over the network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
*   **User Interaction (UI:R):**  Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically the user must click on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access (PR:N):** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the system to perform the attack.
*   The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload.
*   The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious URL to a user of the affected Cisco Unified Communications Manager web-based management interface, tricking them to execute it.

**CVSS Score:**
* Base Score: 6.1
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: None
    *   User Interaction: Required
