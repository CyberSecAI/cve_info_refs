Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists in the URL filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) that could allow an attacker to bypass configured URL filter rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a URL filtering bypass. This indicates a flaw in how the WSA processes and enforces URL filtering policies.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-119, which typically refers to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, which might be indirectly related to the vulnerability's root cause (e.g., a parsing error could lead to a buffer-related issue).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass configured URL filter rules.
- The impact is a loss of integrity, meaning the configured security policies are not enforced as intended and restricted content might be accessible.
- The vulnerability does not impact confidentiality or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- The attack does not require user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WSA appliance.
- No authentication or user privileges are needed.
- The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable system such that the URL filter bypass occurs.

**CVSS Score:**
- Base Score: 5.8
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
   -  AV:N (Network) - The attack can be done remotely over the network
   -  AC:L (Low) - The attack complexity is low
   -  PR:N (None) - No privileges are required to perform the attack
   -  UI:N (None) - No user interaction is required to perform the attack
   -  S:C (Changed) - The vulnerability impacts beyond its own security scope
   -  C:N (None) - No impact on confidentiality
   -  I:L (Low) - Low impact on integrity
   -  A:N (None) - No impact on availability

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco WSA prior to the first fixed release when email scanning URL filters are configured.
- There are no workarounds available.
- The vulnerability was discovered during resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- Cisco PSIRT is not aware of public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
