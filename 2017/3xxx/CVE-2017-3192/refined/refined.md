Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3192:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `tools_admin.asp` page of the D-Link DIR-130 and DIR-330 routers discloses the administrator password in base64 encoding within the returned web page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** The administrator password is not adequately protected and is exposed in a weak encoding (base64) in the HTML source of a specific page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can obtain the administrator credentials of the affected router. This allows them to gain full control over the device, potentially leading to a complete compromise.
- This may lead to unauthorized access, modification of settings, data theft, or use of the router for malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who has access to the router's web management interface.
- The attacker needs to access the `tools_admin.asp` page to extract the credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the router's management interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router to access the `tools_admin.asp` page.
- Exploitation of CVE-2017-3191 (authentication bypass) can enable access to the vulnerable page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in D-Link DIR-130 firmware version 1.23 and DIR-330 firmware version 1.12.
- The vulnerability is often combined with CVE-2017-3191 (authentication bypass) for easier exploitation.
- CERT/CC was not aware of a practical solution at the time of reporting.
- D-Link was notified on January 25, 2017.
