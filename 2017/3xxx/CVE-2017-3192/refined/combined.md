## D-Link DIR-130 and DIR-330 are vulnerable to authentication bypass and do not protect credentials

#### Vulnerability Note VU#553503

Original Release Date: 2017-03-15 | Last Revised: 2017-03-24

---

### Overview

The D-Link DIR-130 and DIR-330 are vulnerable to authentication bypass of the remote login page, and do not sufficiently protect administrator credentials.

### Description

| The D-Link DIR-130, firmware version 1.23, and DIR-330, firmware version 1.12, are vulnerable to the following:  [**CWE-294**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay -** CVE-2017-3191A remote attacker that can access the remote management login page can manipulate the POST request in such a manner as to access some administrator-only pages such as tools\_admin.asp without credentials.[**CWE-522**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials** **-** CVE-2017-3192The tools\_admin.asp page discloses the administrator password in base64 encoding in the returned web page. A remote attacker with access to this page (potentially through a authentication bypass such as CVE-2017-3191) may obtain administrator credentials for the device.D-Link has confirmed these issues to the CERT/CC.Other D-Link models may be affected by these issues, but were not tested by the reporter or the CERT/CC. CERT/CC has received a report that the DIR-655 may also be impacted, but has not verified it at this time. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to obtain administrator credentials and access administrator functionality of the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.Affected users may consider the following workaround: |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Additionally, you may wish to disable remote administration of the router. |

# D-Link DIR-130 and DIR-330 routers vulnerable

March 16, 2017Share[By Doug Olenick](/contributor/doug-olenick)

US-CERT reported that the D-Link DIR-130 and DIR-330 routers are vulnerable to authentication bypass of the remote login page and the devices do not sufficiently protect administrator credentials.

The vulnerabilities to the D-Link DIR-130, firmware version 1.23,  and DIR-330, firmware version 1.12 are covered under CVE-2017-3191 and CVE-2017- 3192.

The former issue allows a remote attacker to access the remote management login page and manipulate a POST request to gain access to administrator-only pages. The latter vulnerability is that the tools\_admin.asp page discloses the administrator password in base64 encoding. When this flaw is exploited in conjunction with CVE-2017-3191 the attacker can obtain the router's administrator credentials.

D-Link was notified of the issue on January 25, but CERT stated it is unaware of a solution. One possible workaround is for users to disable remote administration.
