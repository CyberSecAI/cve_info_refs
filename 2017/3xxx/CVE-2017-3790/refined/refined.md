**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the received packet parser of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of received packets leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The specific nature of the parsing error is not detailed, only that it can be triggered by a specifically crafted packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a reload of the affected system.
- The reload leads to a denial-of-service (DoS), making the system unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and over the network (AV:N).
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated attacker (PR:N).
- No user interaction is needed (UI:N).
- The vulnerability impacts the system's availability, creating a complete denial of service (A:H).
- The scope is changed (S:C)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided CVSS vector string (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H) aligns with the details of this vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds, and the issue is resolved by upgrading to version X8.8.2 or later.
