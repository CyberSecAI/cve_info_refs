Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Acronis True Image versions through and including 2017 Build 8053 perform update operations over unprotected HTTP channels.
*   Downloaded updates are not validated beyond verifying the server-provided MD5 hash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Communication:** Use of HTTP for update checks and downloads instead of HTTPS. This allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **Insufficient Validation:** Only MD5 hash verification of downloaded updates is performed which is vulnerable to collision attacks, and does not ensure authenticity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can cause the True Image update process to execute arbitrary code with system administrator privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker needs to be on the same network as, or otherwise able to intercept network traffic from, an Acronis True Image user.
*   The attacker intercepts the update request and provides a malicious payload instead of legitimate updates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim or able to intercept/redirect network traffic between the victim and the update server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP traffic, specifically modify the update response.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Acronis True Image 2017 Build 8058. Although the updates are still checked and downloaded over HTTP, the certificate of the downloaded update is verified.
*   The vendor considers the risk to be low since specific, rare occurrences would need to happen for exploitation.
*   CVSS metrics are provided:
    *   Base Score: 8.3 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) - Adjacent Network, Low Complexity, No Authentication, Confidentiality Impact: Complete, Integrity Impact: Complete, Availability Impact: Complete.
    *   Temporal Score: 7.5 (E:POC/RL:U/RC:C) - Proof-of-Concept exploit available, Unconfirmed Remediation Level, Confirmed Report Confidence.
    *  Environmental Score: 5.6

This information is consistent with the description of CVE-2017-3219 that involves a vulnerability in Acronis True Image relating to insecure updates.
