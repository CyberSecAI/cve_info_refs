## Acronis True Image fails to update itself securely

#### Vulnerability Note VU#489392

Original Release Date: 2017-06-19 | Last Revised: 2017-06-28

---

### Overview

Acronis True Image fails to securely check for and retrieve updates, which an allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges.

### Description

| Acronis True Image is a disk backup utility for Windows and Mac systems. Acronis True Image versions through and including 2017 Build 8053 performs update operations over unprotected HTTP channels. Downloaded updates are not validated beyond verifying the server-provided MD5 hash. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the same network as, or who can otherwise affect network traffic from, an Acronis True Image user can cause the True Image update process to execute arbitrary code with system administrator privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in Acronis True Image 2017 Build 8058. Although the updates are still checked and downloaded over HTTP, the certificate of the downloaded update is verified. |
| --- |

| **Don't use built-in update capabilities**Because Acronis True Image does not include the ability to securely check for and install updates, any True Image updates should be obtained from <https://www.acronis.com/> directly, using your web browser.**Avoid untrusted networks**Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack. |
