Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how BIND versions, specifically those shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, handle DNSSEC validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core vulnerability is an assertion failure triggered during DNSSEC validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the named service (BIND's DNS server process) to terminate unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted DNS response to a vulnerable BIND server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send DNS responses to the target BIND server. This can be done remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to BIND versions shipped with RHEL 6 and does not affect upstream BIND versions.
- The vulnerability does not affect BIND configurations with DNSSEC validation turned off.
- The issue has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 through security updates (RHSA-2017:1202 and RHSA-2017:1582).
