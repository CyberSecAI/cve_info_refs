**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the web framework of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, which is susceptible to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of the affected software. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be remote and unauthenticated. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning the victim needs to interact with a malicious link or content crafted by the attacker.
