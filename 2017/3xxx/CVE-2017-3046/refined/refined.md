Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-3046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JPEG2000 images within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data while parsing JPEG2000 images. This allows reading memory beyond the allocated buffer.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information by triggering the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Code Execution:** The vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could potentially lead to code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file that contains a crafted JPEG2000 image.
