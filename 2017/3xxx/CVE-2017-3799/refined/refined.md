Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in a URL parameter within Cisco WebEx Meeting Center. This parameter is not properly validated, allowing for site redirection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: While not a direct path traversal in the file system sense, the vulnerability allows redirection to arbitrary external sites due to improper validation of the URL parameter. The provided content explicitly identifies CWE-22 as the relevant weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can redirect a user to an arbitrary website. This could be used for phishing attacks, where a user is tricked into entering credentials on a fake site that looks like the legitimate one, or for other malicious purposes.
*   Successful exploitation has a CVSS base score of 5.0 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N. The impact is rated as low integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit this remotely.
*   The attack requires low privileges (PR:L).
*   No user interaction (UI:N) is needed.
*   The scope is changed (S:C) because the redirection takes the user outside the context of the original site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to send a crafted URL to a target user to perform the redirection.
*   The attacker does not require any authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   Cisco has provided a workaround where the *Enforce BACKURL Domain Names* option can be checked to disable redirection. This is done by contacting WebEx Support. A future fix will allow this to be configured by the administrator.
*   There is no indication that this vulnerability was publicly exploited.
