### AMF – Another Malicious Format

AMF is a binary serialization format primarily used by Flash applications. Code White has found that several Java AMF libraries contain vulnerabilities, which result in unauthenticated remote code execution. As AMF is widely used, these vulnerabilities may affect products of numerous vendors, including Adobe, Atlassian, HPE, SonicWall, and VMware.

Vulnerability disclosure has been coordinated with US CERT (see [US CERT VU#307983](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307983)).

## Summary

Code White has analyzed the following popular Java AMF implementations:

* *Flex BlazeDS* by Adobe (retired, [contributed Flex to the Apache Software Foundation in 2011](http://flex.apache.org/about-history.html))
* [*Flex BlazeDS* by Apache](http://flex.apache.org/)
* *Flamingo AMF Serializer* by Exadel (discontinued)
* *GraniteDS* (discontinued?)
* [*WebORB for Java* by Midnight Coders](http://www.themidnightcoders.com/products/weborb-for-java/overview.html)

Each of these have been found to be affected by one or more of the following vulnerabilities:

* XML external entity resolution (XXE)
* Creation of arbitrary objects and setting of properties
* Java Deserialization via RMI

The former two vulnerabilities are not completely new.[1](#footnote-1) But we found that other implementations are also vulnerable. Finally, a way to turn a design flaw common to all implementations into a Java deserialization vulnerability has been discovered.

|  | XXE | JavaBeans Setters | Deserialization via RMI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adobe Flex BlazeDS4.6.0.23207 | ☒ | ☐ | ☒ |
| Apache Flex BlazeDS4.7.2 | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| Flamingo AMF Serializer2.2.0 | ☒ | ☒ | ☒ |
| GraniteDS3.1.1.GA | ☒ | ☒ | ☒ |
| WebORB for Java5.1.0.0 | ☒ | ☒ | ☒ |

We'll get into details later, except for the XXE. If you're looking for details on that, have a look at our previous blog post [CVE-2015-3269: Apache Flex BlazeDS XXE Vulnerabilty](http://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2015/08/cve-2015-3269-apache-flex-blazeds-xxe.html).

## Introduction

The Action Message Format version 3 (AMF3) is a binary message format mainly used by Flash applications for communicating with the back end. Like JSON, it supports different kind of basic data types. For backwards compatibility, AMF3 is implemented as an extension of the original AMF (often referred to as AMF0), with AMF3 being a newly introduced AMF0 object type.

One of the new features of AMF3 objects is the addition of two certain characteristics, so called traits:

> […] ActionScript 3.0 introduces two further traits to describe how objects are serialized, namely 'dynamic' and 'externalizable'. The following table outlines the terms and their meanings:
>
> * […]
> * *Dynamic*: an instance of a Class definition with the dynamic trait declared; public variable members can be added and removed from instances dynamically at runtime
> * *Externalizable*: an instance of a Class that implements flash.utils.IExternalizable and completely controls the serialization of its members (no property names are included in the trait information).
>
> — <http://www.adobe.com/go/amfspec>

Let's elaborate on these new traits, especially on how these are implemented and the resulting implications.

## The *Dynamic* Trait

The *dynamic* trait is comparable to JavaBeans functionality: it allows the creation of an object by specifying its class name and its properties by name and value. And actually, many implementations use existing JavaBeans utilities such as the *java.beans.Introspector* (e. g., Flamingo, Flex BlazeDS, WebORB) or they implement their own introspector with similar functionality (e. g., GraniteDS).

That this kind of functionality can pose an exploitable vulnerability has already been noticed and shown various times. Frankly, [Wouter Coekaerts had already reported this kind of vulnerability in some AMF implementations in 2011](http://wouter.coekaerts.be/2011/amf-arbitrary-code-execution) and published an exploit for applications based on Catalina (e. g., Tomcat) in 2016. And with the advent of Java deserialization vulnerability research, even a [way of extending arbitrary setter calls to Java deserialization using JRE classes only](http://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2016/05/return-of-rhino-old-gadget-revisited.html) has been suggested.

## The *Externalizable* Trait

The *externalizable* trait is comparable to Java's *java.io.Externalizable* interface. And in fact, all mentioned library vendors actually interpreted the *flash.utils.IExternalizable* interface from the specification as being equivalent to Java's *java.io.Externalizable*, effectively allowing the reconstruction of any class implementing the *java.io.Externalizable* interface.

Short excursion regarding the different between *java.io.Serializable* and *java.io.Externalizable*: if you look at the [*java.io.Serializable* interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html), you'll see it is empty. So there are no formal contracts that can be enforced at build time by the compiler. But classes implementing the *java.io.Serializable* interface have the option to override the default serialization/deserialization by implementing various methods. That means there are a lot of additional checks during runtime whether an actual object implements one of these opt-in methods, which makes the whole process bloated and slow.

Therefore, the [*java.io.Externalizable* interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Externalizable.html) was introduced, which specifies two methods, *readExternal(java.io.ObjectInput)* and *writeExternal(java.io.ObjectInput)*, that give the class complete control over the serialization/deserialization. This means no default serialization/deserialization behavior, no additional checks during runtime, no magic. That makes serialization/deserialization using *java.io.Externalizable* much simpler and thus faster than using *java.io.Serializable*.

But now let's get back on track.

## Turning *Externalizable.readExternal* into *ObjectInputStream.readObject*

In OpenJDK 8u121, there are 15 classes implementing the *java.io.Externalizable* and most of them only do boring stuff like reconstructing an object's state. Additionally, the actual instances of the *java.io.ObjectInput* passed to *Externalizable.readExternal(java.io.ObjectInput)* methods of the implementations are also not an instance of *java.io.ObjectInputStream*. So no quick win here.

Of these 15 classes, those related to RMI stood out. That word alone should make you sit up. Especially *sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef* and *sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef2* seemed interesting, as they reconstruct a *sun.rmi.transport.LiveRef* object via its *sun.rmi.transport.LiveRef.read(ObjectInput, boolean)* method. This method then reconstructs a *sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPEndpoint* and a local *sun.rmi.transport.LiveRef* and registers it at the *sun.rmi.transport.DGCClient*, the RMI distributed garbage collector client:

> *DGCClient* implements the client-side of the RMI distributed garbage collection system.
>
> The external interface to *DGCClient* is the "*registerRefs*" method. When a *LiveRef* to a remote object enters the VM, it needs to be registered with the *DGCClient* to participate in distributed garbage collection.
>
> When the first *LiveRef* to a particular remote object is registered, a "dirty" call is made to the server-side distributed garbage collector for the remote object […]
>
> — <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/file/jdk8u121-b00/src/share/classes/sun/rmi/transport/DGCClient.java#l54>

So according to the documentation, the registration of our *LiveRef* results in the call for a remote object to the endpoint specified in our *LiveRef*? Sounds like RCE via RMI!

Tracing the call hierarchy of *ObjectInputStream.readObject* actually reveals that there is a path from an *Externalizable.readExternal* call via *sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef*/*sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef2* to *ObjectInputStream.readObject* in *sun.rmi.transport.StreamRemoteCall.executeCall()*.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhR_p9_a5MmchHs8dluDfopBA3iwrwXvSWO0aiQ7T0if3KCNFbUZ5_zcGfxAGL-i0gZPtopngvBw4i3Ce8NsY3pfJ-NNXqBx2-beGMweIsLMGcorKIOlrLn2L_0l_5XNwlBtAwRwGFxZP8/s1600/Selection_2017-03-30_03.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhR_p9_a5MmchHs8dluDfopBA3iwrwXvSWO0aiQ7T0if3KCNFbUZ5_zcGfxAGL-i0gZPtopngvBw4i3Ce8NsY3pfJ-NNXqBx2-beGMweIsLMGcorKIOlrLn2L_0l_5XNwlBtAwRwGFxZP8/s1600/Selection_2017-03-30_03.png)

So let's see what happens if we deserialize an AMF message with a *sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef* object using the following code utilizing Flex BlazeDS:

As a first proof of concept, we just start a listener with *netcat* and see if the connection gets established.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVtwTAKZyyqjlEwdY5jRJEojdrM4vzndi6FkI7VfiEKAomBojdtNMEQdFvOtQuu5-Xu5k_-mHqV9Ks61EudwSGCJLnMGxn-_8HKgxd5VuS0Iqo2XNn4nW-vPWRW2vwOMiA-f743rsAsOA/s1600/Selection_2017-03-31_04.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVtwTAKZyyqjlEwdY5jRJEojdrM4vzndi6FkI7VfiEKAomBojdtNMEQdFvOtQuu5-Xu5k_-mHqV9Ks61EudwSGCJLnMGxn-_8HKgxd5VuS0Iqo2XNn4nW-vPWRW2vwOMiA-f743rsAsOA/s1600/Selection_2017-03-31_04.png)

And we actually got a connection from a client, trying to speak the [Java RMI Transport Protocol](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/rmi/spec/rmi-protocol3.html). 😃

## Exploitation

This technique has already been shown as a [deserialization blacklist bypass by Jacob Baines](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-07) in 2016, but I'm not sure if he was aware that it also turns any *Externalizable.readExternal* into an *ObjectInputStream.readObject*. He also presented a JRMP listener that sends a specified payload. Later, the [JRMP listener has been added to ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/exploit/JRMPListener.java), which can deliver any available payload:

```
java -cp ysoserial.jar ysoserial.exploit.JRMPListener ...
```
## Mitigation

* Applications using Adobe's/Apache's implementation should migrate to Apache's latest release version 4.7.3, that addresses this [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX-35290).
* Exadel has discontinued its library, so there won't be any updates.
* For GraniteDS and WebORB for Java, there is currently no response/solution.

Coincidentally, there is the JDK Enhancement Proposal [JEP 290: Filter Incoming Serialization Data](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290) addressing the issue of Java deserialization vulnerabilities in general, which has already been implemented in the most recent JDK versions 6u141, 7u131, and 8u121.

## Action Message Format (AMF3) Java implementations are vulnerable to insecure deserialization and XML external entities references

#### Vulnerability Note VU#307983

Original Release Date: 2017-04-04 | Last Revised: 2017-04-14

---

### Overview

Several Java implementations of AMF3 are vulnerable to insecure deserialization and XML external entities references.

### Description

| Several Java implementations of Action Message Format (AMF3) are vulnerable to one or more of the following implementation errors:  [**CWE-502**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**Some Java implementations of AMF3 deserializers derive class instances from java.io.Externalizable rather than the [AMF3 specification](http://www.adobe.com/go/amfspec)'s recommendation of flash.utils.IExternalizable. A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control an RMI server connection may be able to send serialized Java objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized.The reporter has identified the following products and versions as being affected, and CVE ID have been assigned as follows:- Atlassian JIRA, versions from 4.2.4 prior to version 6.3.0 - CVE-2017-5983- Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel, version 2.2.0 - CVE-2017-3201- GraniteDS, version 3.1.1.GA - CVE-2017-3199- Pivotal/Spring spring-flex - CVE-2017-3203- WebORB for Java by Midnight Coders, version 5.1.1.0 - CVE-2017-3207Products using these libraries may also be impacted.[**CWE-913**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/913.html)**: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources**Some Java implementations of AMF3 deserializers may allow instantiation of arbitrary classes via their public parameter-less constructor and subsequently call arbitrary Java Beans setter methods. The ability to exploit this vulnerability depends on the availability of classes in the class path that make use of deserialization. A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control information may be able to send serialized Java objects with pre-set properties that result in arbitrary code execution when deserialized.The reporter has identified the following products and versions as being affected, and CVE ID have been assigned as follows:- Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel, version 2.2.0 - CVE-2017-3202- Flex BlazeDS , versions 4.6.0.23207 and 4.7.2 - CVE-2017-5641- GraniteDS, version 3.1.1.GA - CVE-2017-3200Products using these libraries may also be impacted.[**CWE-611**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)**: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')**Some Java implementations of AMF3 deserializers allow external entity references (XXEs) from XML documents embedded within AMF3 messages. If the XML parsing is handled incorrectly it could potentially expose sensitive data on the server, denial of service, or server side request forgery. - Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel, version 2.2.0 - CVE-2017-3206- Flex BlazeDS , version 4.6.0.23207 - CVE-2015-3269- GraniteDS, version 3.1.1.GA - CVE-2016-2340 (see [VU#279472](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/279472))- WebORB for Java by Midnight Coders, version 5.1.1.0 - CVE-2017-3208Products using these libraries may also be impacted.More information is provided in the researcher's [advisory](http://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2017/04/amf.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control a server connection may be able to send serialized Java objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update if available**CERT/CC recommends applying an update or patch to your product if available. Some vendors have responded that only out-of-support versions of products are impacted. In these cases, CERT/CC recommends updating your product to the latest supported version.More details are included for each vendor in the vendor records below. |
| --- |

| **Developers should use an updated JDK**Developers should use an updated Java development kit (JDK). JDK 8 update 121, JDK 7 update 131 and JDK 6 update 141 implement basic serialization blacklisting filters, while more serialization protection measures are expected in the upcoming Java 9. For more information, please see [JEP 290](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/290).**Developers should be suspicious of deserialized data from untrusted sources**Developers should in general be very suspicious of deserialized data from an untrusted source. For best practices, see the [CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=27492407) guidelines for Serialization, especially rules [SER12-J](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/SER12-J.%2BPrevent%2Bdeserialization%2Bof%2Buntrusted%2Bclasses) and [SER13-J](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/SER13-J.%2BTreat%2Bdata%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bdeserialized%2Bas%2Bpotentially%2Bmalicious%2Bby%2Bdefault).**Use firewall rules or filesystem restrictions**System administrators may be able to mitigate this issue for some applications by restricting access to the network and/or filesystem. If an affected application utilizes an open port accepting serialized objects, restricting access to the application may help mitigate the issue. |
