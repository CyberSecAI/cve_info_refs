Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3201:

**Vulnerability:** Insecure Deserialization and Improper Control of Dynamically Managed Code Resources.

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the way some Java implementations of Action Message Format (AMF3) handle deserialization. Instead of adhering to the AMF3 specification's recommendation of using `flash.utils.IExternalizable`, they use `java.io.Externalizable`. This allows the reconstruction of any class implementing the `java.io.Externalizable` interface, including RMI-related classes like `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef` which can lead to arbitrary code execution through RMI.
*   Some implementations allow instantiation of arbitrary classes via their public parameter-less constructor and call arbitrary Java Bean setter methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502):** Exploitable via the `java.io.Externalizable` interface, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources (CWE-913):** Exploitable by creating arbitrary objects and setting their properties using Java Bean setters, which can also lead to remote code execution if used with suitable classes in the classpath.
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (CWE-611)**: Although not the primary focus of CVE-2017-3201, some AMF3 implementations also suffer from this vulnerability, due to improper XML parsing of embedded XML documents within AMF3 messages. This can lead to sensitive data exposure, denial of service, or server side request forgery.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote code execution is the primary impact. By crafting malicious AMF3 messages with specific serialized Java objects, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   The XXE vulnerability can cause information disclosure, denial of service, or server-side request forgery.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A remote attacker can send maliciously crafted AMF3 messages to a vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the vulnerable AMF3 endpoint.
*   The attacker may need to spoof or control a server connection.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft AMF3 messages that exploit the insecure deserialization or dynamic object creation flaws, or the XML external entity injection.

**Specific Details for CVE-2017-3201:**
*   This CVE specifically refers to the `Flamingo amf-serializer` by Exadel, version 2.2.0.
*   It is vulnerable to insecure deserialization (CWE-502), improper control of dynamically managed code resources (CWE-913), and XXE (CWE-611).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The blog post details how `Externalizable.readExternal` can be turned into `ObjectInputStream.readObject`, which allows for exploitation using RMI.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious object of type `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef` or `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef2`.
*   The vulnerability is related to a deserialization blacklist bypass by Jacob Baines, who also presented a JRMP listener that sends a specified payload and was later added to ysoserial.
