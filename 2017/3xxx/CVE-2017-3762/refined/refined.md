Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Lenovo Fingerprint Manager Pro software used a hard-coded password.
*   It employed a weak encryption algorithm to protect stored fingerprint data and Windows logon credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded password:** The application had a hard-coded password, making it accessible to local non-administrative users.
*   **Weak Encryption:** Sensitive data, including fingerprint data and Windows logon credentials, were encrypted with a weak algorithm, rendering the encryption ineffective.
*   **Missing Access Control:**  All users with local, non-administrative access could access the application due to the hard-coded password, bypassing proper access controls.
*   **Storage of Sensitive Data:** The application stored sensitive data like fingerprint templates and Windows logon credentials, increasing the impact of a potential breach.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with local non-administrative access could gain unauthorized access to the Fingerprint Manager Pro software because of the hardcoded password.
*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers could decrypt the stored Windows logon credentials due to weak encryption.
*   **Fingerprint Data Theft:** Attackers could access and decrypt stored fingerprint data, leading to potential misuse.
*   **Impersonation:** Stolen fingerprint data could be used to impersonate legitimate users for authentication and identification purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector was local access to a system where the vulnerable Lenovo Fingerprint Manager Pro software was installed.
*   **Software Exploitation:** Exploitation involved taking advantage of the hard-coded password and weak encryption used by the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Non-Administrative Access:** An attacker needed local non-administrative access to a target machine running the vulnerable software. This indicates that physical access or remote access with lower level privileges is enough to exploit this flaw.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needed to understand how to exploit the hard-coded password and weak encryption.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Fingerprint Manager Pro version 8.01.86 and earlier.
*   The affected software was compatible with Windows 7, 8, and 8.1.
*   A list of affected Lenovo devices is provided in the content.
*   Lenovo released an update (version 8.01.87 or later) to fix the vulnerability.
