Subject: Re: Re: fprintd: found storing user fingerprints
 without encryption

I am sorry to say that I am not familiar with this mailing list.

I am not insisting that encryption key should be on the disk or is
encrypted with a static key that is embedded in the binary.
Instead, we can make fprintd to use a TPM, if available.
Otherwise, but even though it is not perfect, it would be better to apply
the fingerprint data protection, such as keyring or access control, rather
than raw fingerprint template.
FYI, Windows Hello might use Next Generation Cryptography (called CNG) to
protect and store user private data and encryption keys.

> I think that this is similar approach with Lenovo Fingerprint Manager,
Microsoft Windows Hello and other products.

Have you read the following papers about fingerprint image reconstruction
technology from standard templates?
[1] R. Cappelli et al., “Fingerprint Image Reconstruction from Standard
Templates”, IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,
vol.29, no.9, pp.1489-1503, 2007.
[2] A. Ross et al., “From template to image: Reconstructing fingerprints
from minutiae points”, IEEE Trans on Pattern Analysis and Machine
Intelligence, vol.29, no.4, pp.544-560, 2007.
[3] R. Cappelli et al., “Can Fingerprints be reconstructed from ISO
Templates?”, IEEE ICARCV 2006.
[4] J. Feng et al., “Fingerprint Reconstruction: From Minutiae to Phase”,
IEEE Trans on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol.33, no.2,
pp.209-223, 2011.
[5] A. Rozsa et al., "Genetic Algorithm Attack on Minutiae-Based
Fingerprint Authentication and Protected Template Fingerprint Systems",
CVPR 2015.

>They presents methods to create sophisticated and natural-looking
fingerprints only from the numerical template data.
>They successfully evaluate this approach against a number of undisclosed
state-of-the-art algorithms and the NIST Fingerprint Image Software.

Lastly, as you mentioned,  it is a stupid idea to use it for various
authentication.
But, it is still working on various authentication/identification system.

Hello,

You do realize that every secret that is stored in a way that is readable by software without authentication that is independent of any software running on the host is in fact readable, right?
It is irrelevant if you encrypt your "secret" storage with a key that is on the disk or is encrypted with a static key that is embedded in the binary. It's on the same level of security as storing it in plain text regarding attackers that have access to the host on a software level. What Windows Hello does is only any more secure if the key storage is backed by, for example, a TPM that needs to be unlocked first using attestation. The whole problem reverts to securing a host against intrusion via software in this scenario.

> This vulnerability could allow a process to access the stored fingerprint and then it can be reverted to natural-looking original fingerprint image.

That is only the case if an actual picture is stored. If you only store any detected minutiae, you can't revert to an image. That's because the detection of the minutiae is fuzzy and every measurement is different.

Yes, exactly like I mentioned. It's a stupid idea to use it for any type of authentication, verification or evidence.

Subject: Re: Re: fprintd: found storing user fingerprints
 without encryption

In Microsoft's Windows Hello, fingerprint data is kept locally on user's PC
in an encrypted way while Linux does not, even though they are based on
same fingerprint reader hardware.
Windows Hello may use Next Generation Cryptography (called CNG) to protect
and store user private data and encryption keys.
(see
<https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4468253/windows-hello-and-privacy-microsoft-privacy>
)

Lenovo's Fingerprint Manager Pro also stores user's fingerprints encrypted
in its local environment.
In this regard, a flaw was discovered in Lenovo Fingerprint Manager Pro
(see CVE-2017-3762).
(see
<https://thenextweb.com/security/2018/01/26/lenovo-fingerprint-manager-flaw-windows/>
)

Moreover, FireEye researchers Tao Wei and Yulong Zhang outlined new ways to
attack Android devices to extract user fingerprints at Black Hat USA 2015
(see Fingerprints On Mobile Devices: Abusing and Leaking?).
(see
<https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-can-remotely-steal-fingerprints-from-android-phones/>
)

This vulnerability could allow a process to access the stored fingerprint
and then it can be reverted to natural-looking original fingerprint image.
It allows the attacker to impersonate a legitimate
authentication/identification by using stolen fingerprints.

Once fingerprint has been leaked, victims are leaked for the rest of life
since it lasts for a life.
Moreover, fingerprints are usually associated with every citizen’s identity
and immigration record.
It would be a hazard if the attacker can remotely harvest fingerprints in a
large scale.

What do you think of it?

# Lenovo’s fingerprint authentication app had bad bugs that made it easy to hack

January 26, 2018 - 5:02 pm

![Lenovo’s fingerprint authentication app had bad bugs that made it easy to hack]()
![Lenovo’s fingerprint authentication app had bad bugs that made it easy to hack](https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image?fit=1280%2C720&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F01%2Flenovo.png&signature=004fc22c2286b956443dcd7ea00d1022)

This is pretty jarring. Lenovo has confirmed its in-house authentication software Fingerprint Manager Pro (version 8.01.86), which lets users unlock their devices using fingerprint recognition, was affected by a severe vulnerability which attackers could exploit to access to any system equipped with the app.

As per Lenovo’s [disclosure](https://support.lenovo.com/nl/en/product_security/len-15999), Fingerprint Manager contained a hard-coded password that made it accessible to all users with local non-administrative access. In addition to this, it stored sensitive information like Windows logon credentials and fingerprint data which were “encrypted using a weak algorithm.”

“Sensitive data stored by Lenovo Fingerprint Manager Pro, including users’ Windows logon credentials and fingerprint data, is encrypted using a weak algorithm, contains a hard-coded password, and is accessible to all users with local non-administrative access to the system it is installed in,” the report read.

The flaw was discovered by researcher Jackson Thuraisamy from Security Compass.

For those unfamiliar, Fingerprint Manager allowed users with fingerprint-enabled Lenovo devices to log in using their fingers.

The faulty software is available for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. According to a [details](https://support.lenovo.com/nl/en/product_security/len-15999) posted on the company’s website, this is the full list of devices compatible with Fingerprint Manager:

* ThinkPad L560
* ThinkPad P40 Yoga, P50s
* ThinkPad T440, T440p, T440s, T450, T450s, T460, T540p, T550, T560
* ThinkPad W540, W541, W550s
* ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Type 20A7, 20A8), X1 Carbon (Type 20BS, 20BT)
* ThinkPad X240, X240s, X250, X260
* ThinkPad Yoga 14 (20FY), Yoga 460
* ThinkCentre M73, M73z, M78, M79, M83, M93, M93p, M93z
* ThinkStation E32, P300, P500, P700, P900

Users running an affected iteration of the authentication app are advised to immediately update to version 8.01.87 or later. You can do so by clicking [here](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/downloads/ds034486).

The security blunder is not the first on the company’s record. Back in 2015, Lenovo got its [website hacked](https://thenextweb.com/news/lenovos-website-was-hacked-and-its-kind-of-perfect) – a week after it was [caught secretly loading adware on new computers](https://thenextweb.com/news/lenovo-caught-installing-adware-new-computers).
