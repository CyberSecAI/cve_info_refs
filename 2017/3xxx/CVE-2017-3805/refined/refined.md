Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOx Software. Specifically, the interface displays confidential information without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information via the web management interface.
- **Missing Authentication:** The lack of proper authentication controls on the web interface allows unauthorized access to the displayed information.
- **CWE-200:** The advisory explicitly mentions CWE-200, which is "Information Exposure." This CWE accurately describes the type of vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can view confidential information that is normally protected by authentication mechanisms. The impact is limited to information disclosure, with no impact to integrity or availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network (AV:N). This means the attacker does not need local access to the system.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco device.
- The attacker does not need prior knowledge of any user credentials to access the information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOx Software running on IR829, IR809, IE4K, and CGR1K platforms.
- Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by the vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. Users must apply the software updates to mitigate the issue.
