## Flash Seats Mobile App for Android and iOS fails to validate SSL certificates

#### Vulnerability Note VU#247016

Original Release Date: 2017-03-08 | Last Revised: 2017-03-13

---

### Overview

Flash Seats Mobile App for Android, version 1.7.9 and earlier, and for iOS, version 1.9.51 and earlier, fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which may enable an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

### Description

| [**CWE-295**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)**: Improper Certificate Validation -** CVE-2017-3190  [Flash Seats Mobile App](http://www.flashseats.com/Mobile.htm) is a sports and entertainment ticket management application. On both Android and iOS devices, the app fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which means that an attacker in the position to perform MITM attacks may be able to obtain sensitive account information such as login credentials. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the same network as the Android or iOS device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS, which may lead to the exposure of sensitive account information, including login credentials. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vendor has released Android version 1.7.10 and iOS version 1.9.52 to address this vulnerability. Users are encouraged to update to the latest releases. |
| --- |

| **Do not use affected versions of the application**The features and services provided by the application are likely accessible via the [Flash Seats](https://www.flashseats.com/) web site. By using a web browser to access those resources, you may avoid situations where SSL is not validated.**Avoid untrusted networks**Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack. |
