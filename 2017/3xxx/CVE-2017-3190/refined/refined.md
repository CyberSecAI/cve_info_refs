Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Flash Seats Mobile App for both Android and iOS fails to properly validate SSL certificates when establishing HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The application does not correctly verify the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the mobile app and the server can intercept, view, and modify network traffic that should be encrypted via HTTPS.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Attackers can potentially obtain sensitive user data, including login credentials and other account information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker on the same network as the affected device (e.g., a public Wi-Fi network).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's mobile device to perform a MITM attack.
- **Interception of Network Traffic:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the app and the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Flash Seats Mobile App for Android versions 1.7.9 and earlier and for iOS versions 1.9.51 and earlier.
- Updated versions of the app (Android 1.7.10 and iOS 1.9.52) have been released to address the vulnerability.
- It is recommended that users avoid using untrusted networks (like public Wi-Fi) and update to the latest versions of the app.
- Accessing the services via a web browser may avoid the SSL validation issue because browsers typically handle certificate validation correctly.
