Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the Cisco Firepower System Software's detection engine when reassembling Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) packets. Specifically, the process of reassembling SSL packets leads to excessive CPU consumption by the Snort process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition arising from excessive CPU utilization.
*   **Inefficient Resource Handling:** The detection engine's reassembly process of SSL packets is not optimized, leading to the Snort process consuming a high level of CPU resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful attack results in a denial-of-service condition. This DoS occurs because the affected device's Snort process consumes excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to service disruption.
*   The high CPU usage will likely cause the system to become unresponsive or perform very poorly.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker from a remote location without requiring any authentication.
*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is network-based, involving the manipulation of SSL packets sent to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted SSL packets to the vulnerable Cisco Firepower System Software.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco Firepower System Software releases 6.0.0, 6.1.0, 6.2.0, and 6.2.1 when an SSL policy with traffic decryption rules is configured.
*   There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS base score is 6.8, indicating a medium severity. The vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H` indicates:
    *   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   **AC:H** (Attack Complexity: High)
    *   **PR:N** (Privileges Required: None)
    *  **UI:N** (User Interaction: None)
    *  **S:C** (Scope: Changed)
    *  **C:N** (Confidentiality Impact: None)
    *  **I:N** (Integrity Impact: None)
    *  **A:H** (Availability Impact: High)

This vulnerability is categorized as CWE-399 (Resource Management Errors).
