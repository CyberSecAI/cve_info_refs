Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data within the JPEG2000 parsing functionality in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. Specifically, the application fails to validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by insufficient length validation of input data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** The vulnerability can be triggered when a user opens a maliciously crafted file.
*   **Malicious Page:** The vulnerability can also be triggered when a user visits a malicious page containing specially crafted content.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, either by opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious file or web page to be opened by the victim.
*   The attacker does not need local access to the victim machine.
