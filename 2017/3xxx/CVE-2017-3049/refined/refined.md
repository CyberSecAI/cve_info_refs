Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing TIFF images. Specifically, the application copies this data into a fixed-length heap-based buffer without proper size checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The lack of proper bounds checking before copying user-controlled data into a fixed-size heap buffer allows for a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This could lead to complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File: The attacker can craft a malicious TIFF image.
- Malicious Web Page: An attacker could embed the malicious TIFF image on a web page, which when visited by a user could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either trick the victim into opening a malicious file or visit a page hosting a malicious file.
- The attacker can be remote, needing no prior access to the system.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability and the ability to craft a malicious TIFF image.

**Additional Notes:**
- User interaction is required for the exploitation as the victim must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
- The vulnerability exists within the TIFF image parsing functionality of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- Adobe released updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley (mr_me) of Offensive Security working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
