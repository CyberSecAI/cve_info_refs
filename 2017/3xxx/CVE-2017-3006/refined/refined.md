Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insecure permissions assigned to the "Adobe Photoshop dll & Startup Scripts" directories within the Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application. Specifically, the 'Authenticated Users' group has the "Change" ('C') permission on these directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive "Change" permission granted to the 'Authenticated Users' group on critical application directories. This allows any authenticated user on the system to modify the contents of these directories.
*   **DLL Hijacking/Replacement:** The vulnerability allows for replacing legitimate DLLs (`libifcoremd.dll` and `libmmd.dll`) with malicious ones, leading to arbitrary code execution when those DLLs are loaded by the application.
*   **Startup Script Modification:** The 'Change' permission also allows modification of startup scripts (`photoshop.jsx`), offering an alternative path for code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve local privilege escalation. By replacing or modifying application components, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the security context of any other user on the system, including those with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have an authenticated user account on the system where the vulnerable Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user on the targeted system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to write files to the specified directories (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\32 bit Photoshop dlls` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Startup Scripts CC\Adobe Photoshop`).
*   The attacker needs to be able to compile and create a malicious DLL, if that route of attack is chosen.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
The issue stems from the 'Authenticated Users' group having 'Change' permissions on folders where Adobe CC stores DLLs and startup scripts. This allows any authenticated user to modify these files, which the vulnerable software will execute when it is run, enabling privilege escalation.
