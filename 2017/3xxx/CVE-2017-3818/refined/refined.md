Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3818

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) scanner of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA). Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by malformed MIME headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is improper input validation of MIME headers within the Cisco ESA's MIME scanner. This allows for a filtering bypass, indicating a failure to properly sanitize or validate the MIME data before processing it with configured filters. The weakness is categorized as CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass configured user filters on the affected Cisco ESA device. This means that malicious emails or attachments that should have been filtered based on policy are instead delivered to end-users. This results in an integrity impact by allowing unfiltered mail to pass through.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted emails with malformed MIME headers to the affected Cisco ESA. The vulnerability does not require any user interaction or special privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a mail server protected by a vulnerable Cisco Email Security Appliance. The attacker is remote and does not require any authentication or privileges on the ESA.

**Additional Notes:**
* The CVSS score is 5.8, indicating a medium severity.
* The vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (both virtual and hardware appliances) if message or content filters are configured for incoming attachments.
* There are no known workarounds, so patching the system is the only way to resolve this.
* The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a support case.
