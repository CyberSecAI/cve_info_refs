- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of LSA recency determination in OSPF implementations, specifically when dealing with LSAs with MaxSequenceNumber. The vulnerability arises because implementations don't enforce that the link values within an LSA with MaxSequenceNumber must be the same as the original when prematurely aging it.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  -  Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value (CWE-354).
  -  Lack of proper verification of link values when comparing LSAs with MaxSequenceNumber
  -  Vulnerable implementations prioritize a larger checksum over content consistency when determining LSA recency.

-  **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Attackers can send crafted OSPF messages to poison routing tables.
    -  This can lead to the erasure or alteration of routing tables of routers within the domain.
    -  Resulting in denial of service or the rerouting of network traffic.

- **Attack vectors:**
    -  Attackers must be able to transmit messages from a router within the target OSPF routing domain.
    -  The attacker crafts a malicious LSA with MaxSequenceNumber and invalid link information to generate a larger checksum.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  Ability to send OSPF messages within the target routing domain.
    -  Knowledge of OSPF LSA structure and checksum calculation.
    - Ability to craft malicious LSA packets.
