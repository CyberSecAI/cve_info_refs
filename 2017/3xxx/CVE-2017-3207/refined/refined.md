Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3207:

**CVE-2017-3207** relates to a vulnerability in **WebORB for Java by Midnight Coders, version 5.1.1.0**, specifically within its AMF3 deserialization implementation. This vulnerability is a result of insecure deserialization practices when handling data in the Action Message Format (AMF3).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way WebORB for Java and other AMF3 implementations handle the `externalizable` trait in AMF3 objects. Instead of adhering to the `flash.utils.IExternalizable` specification, these implementations interpret it as equivalent to Java's `java.io.Externalizable`. This allows the reconstruction of any class implementing the `java.io.Externalizable` interface.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability allows for a call chain to `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` via `Externalizable.readExternal`, in the context of RMI objects like `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef` or `sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef2`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is the ability to deserialize arbitrary Java objects through AMF3 messages due to the misuse of `java.io.Externalizable`.
*   **RMI Exploitation:** The vulnerable deserialization can be chained through RMI classes, leading to a remote code execution vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The AMF3 deserializers do not properly validate the data they are processing which leads to the possibility of crafting malicious messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve RCE on the server by sending a specially crafted AMF3 message containing serialized Java objects.
*   The crafted message exploits the deserialization of objects, specifically RMI related classes, leading to execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker with the ability to send or spoof server connections can exploit this. The vulnerable software is accessible through network connections.
*   **AMF3 Messages:** The attacker sends malicious AMF3 messages to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send AMF3 messages to the server.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication to the system.
*   The attacker does not need access to the filesystem to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present due to a design flaw in how AMF3 libraries handle the externalizable trait by mapping `flash.utils.IExternalizable` to `java.io.Externalizable`
*   This vulnerability has been shown to bypass deserialization blacklists.
*   The vulnerability is similar to other deserialization issues, but this one uses RMI to perform the exploit by turning `Externalizable.readExternal` into `ObjectInputStream.readObject`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Markus Wulftange and coordinated with US-CERT.
*   The provided text also mentions other related CVEs that are present in other AMF3 implementations.
