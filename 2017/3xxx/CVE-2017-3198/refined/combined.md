# [CLVA-2017-01-001]: Gigabyte BRIX arbitrary System Management Mode code execution

# Summary

Cylance identified a vulnerability in the UEFI firmware for the Gigabyte GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms, which could allow arbitrary code execution in System Management Mode (ring -2) by programs running in ring 0.

## Product Description

The Gigabyte BRIX is a common Mini-PC Barebone platform (via <http://www.gigabyte.us/products/list.aspx?s=47&ck=104>).

## Affected Products

* GB-BSi7H-6500 - UEFI firmware version: vF6 (2016/05/18)
* GB-BXi7-5775 - UEFI firmware version: vF2 (2016/07/19)
* Vulnerable code is located inside SMM driver: SmiFlash (GUID: BC327DBD-B982-4F55-9F79-056AD7E987C5)

## Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode, and install a backdoor to the system at a firmware level.

# Vulnerability Information

* Cylance Identifier: CLVA-2017-01-001
* CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-3197

## Description

A vulnerability has been identified in one of the software System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handlers in the UEFI firmware from American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) used in Gigabyte's GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms. The firmware for these models do not use the SPI Protected Ranges (PRx) flash write protection which would prevent an attacker from overwriting the SMRAM and gaining code execution in System Management Mode.

## Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges, execute arbitrary code, and install a backdoor in System Management Mode. Backdoors installed at the SMM level could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability could be used to bypass UEFI firmware security mechanisms which would allow an attacker to modify the SPI flash image to infect the image with a rootkit or bootkit.

## Attack Scenario

An attacker can send malicious requests to the vulnerable SMI handler from ring-0 (ring-0 execution can be obtained either through a kernel vulnerability or a vulnerable 3rd party driver such as Capcom.sys) to trigger the vulnerability and execute code in System Management Mode (SMM). The code executing in the SMM context can install a persistent rootkit/bootkit in the SPI flash chip which would persist across operating system installations.

## Resolution

Gigabyte has released UEFI firmware version F7 to address this issue for the GB-BSi7H-6500 platform. However, the GB-BXi7-5775 is End Of Life (EOL), and therefore may not be receiving an update. Affected users should update the firmware as soon as possible. Firmware updates can be found at [Gigabyte's Support Page](http://www.gigabyte.com/Support).

Earlier this month, we teased a proof of concept for [UEFI ransomware](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/https%3A//threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/uefi-ransomware-full-disclosure-at-black-hat-asia.html), which was presented at [RSA Conference 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ6mEq6DQOo). The HackingTeam, Snowden, Shadow Brokers, and Vault7 leaks have revealed that UEFI/BIOS implants aren't just a theoretical concept, but have actually been weaponized by nation states to conduct cyber-espionage. Physical access requirements are a thing of the past; these low-level implants can be installed remotely by exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying UEFI system.

Today at [BlackHat Asia 2017](https://www.blackhat.com/asia-17/briefings.html#the-uefi-firmware-rootkits-myths-and-reality), we are disclosing two vulnerabilities in two different models of the [GIGABYTE BRIX platform](http://www.gigabyte.us/products/list.aspx?s=47&ck=104):

* GB-BSi7H-6500 – firmware version: vF6 (2016/05/18)
* GB-BXi7-5775 – firmware version: vF2 (2016/07/19)

![](/content/dam/blogs-blackberry-com/images/blogs/2017/03/Fig0-Gigabyte.png)

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to elevate privileges, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode (SMM), and install a backdoor at the firmware level. **We have reported these vulnerabilities to the vendor (see our full disclosure timeline at the end of this post).**

Firmware backdoors are difficult to detect because they execute in the early stages of the boot process and they can persist across operating system (OS) re-installations:

![](/content/dam/blogs-blackberry-com/images/blogs/2017/03/Fig1-Gigabyte.png)

*Figure 1: Attack Flow Chart to Install a UEFI Backdoor*

A practical attack consists of 4 stages:

1. User-mode execution (ring 3)
2. Kernel mode execution (ring 0)
3. SMM execution (ring -2)
4. SPI Flash Write

The attacker gains user-mode execution through an application vulnerability such as a browser exploit or a malicious Word document with an embedded script. From there, the attacker elevates his privileges by exploiting the kernel or a kernel module such as Capcom.sys to execute code in ring 0. A vulnerable SMI handler allows the attacker to execute code in SMM mode (ring -2) where he finally can bypass any write protection mechanisms and install a backdoor into the system's firmware.

Write-protection mechanisms exist to prevent attackers from modifying the firmware; however, the affected systems do not enable them. Figure 2 shows the CHIPSEC output of a system which has enabled BIOS Lock Enable (BLE) and SMM BIOS Write Protection (SMM\_BWP) to prevent modifications to the BIOS:

![](/content/dam/blogs-blackberry-com/images/blogs/2017/03/Fig2-Gigabyte.png)

*Figure 2: CHIPSEC Output of a Write Protected BIOS*

It is up to the motherboard manufacturers to correctly implement the UEFI firmware and enable the appropriate protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications to the firmware. However, as seen below in figure 3, not all manufacturers will ship their systems with the protections enabled:

![](/content/dam/blogs-blackberry-com/images/blogs/2017/03/Fig3-Gigabyte.png)

*Figure 3: CHIPSEC Output of a Non-Write-Protected BIOS*

## CLVA-2017-01-001 / CVE-2017-3197

A vulnerable SMI handler, SmiFlash (GUID: BC327DBD-B982-4F55-9F79-056AD7E987C5), does not validate the input pointers, allowing an attacker to execute in System Management Mode (ring –2).

Gigabyte's implementation of the American Megatrends Inc. (AMI) firmware does not enroll in the necessary protection mechanisms (BIOSWE, BLE, SMM\_BWP, and SPI Protect Ranges) to prevent unauthorized writes to the SPI flash.

This vulnerability can triggered by using an SMI fuzzer in the [CHIPSEC](https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec) project:

![](/content/dam/blogs-blackberry-com/images/blogs/2017/03/Fig99b-Gigabyte.PNG)

Our formal advisory is in our Vulnerability Disclosures repository: [CLVA-2017-01-002](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2017-01-001.md).

## CLVA-2017-01-002 / CVE-2017-3198

The GIGABYTE UEFI firmware does not cryptographically validate images prior to updating the system firmware. Additionally, the firmware updates are served over HTTP without checksums for verifying authenticity.

An attacker can use the provided AMI Firmware Update (AFU) utility to write arbitrary code to the firmware.

Rather than go through the trouble of finding a vulnerability to get ring 0 and ring -2 code execution, an attacker could just use the AFU program to write a backdoor into the system's firmware. Figure 4 demonstrates how an attacker would use the AFU utility delivered through a Word document containing an embedded Powershell dropper to update the firmware with a ransomware payload to block the system from booting into the OS.

![](/content/dam/blogs-blackberry-com/images/blogs/2017/03/Fig4-Gigabyte.png)

*Figure 4: Overview of an Attack Using the Firmware Updater*

Our formal advisory is in our Vulnerability Disclosures repository: [CLVA-2017-01-002](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2017-01-002.md). At [BlackHat Asia 2017](https://www.blackhat.com/asia-17/briefings.html#the-uefi-firmware-rootkits-myths-and-reality), we used the following platform configuration to demonstrate the impact of this vulnerability with persistent installation of UEFI ransomware:

* Gigabyte (GB-BSi7HA-6500)
  + Intel 6th generation Core i7 CPU (Skylake)
  + BIOS Lock (BLE) – ENABLED (not enabled by default)
* MS Windows 10 Enterprise
  + All latest updates installed
  + Virtualization Based Security (VBS) - ENABLED
  + Device Guard – ENABLED
  + Secure Boot – ENABLED

## Vendor Response

GIGABYTE will be releasing a firmware update (vF7) for the GB-BSi-7H-6500 to address these vulnerabilities. The GB-BXi7-5775 is end of life (EOL) and will not be updated.

## Impact and Mitigation

As mentioned in our [previous post](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/https%3A//threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/uefi-ransomware-full-disclosure-at-black-hat-asia.html), successful infection at such a low level has the potential to be disastrous. UEFI rootkits and ransomware, as we demonstrated at both RSA Conference and BlackHat Asia, could provide attackers with a degree of control that is difficult, if not near-impossible, to detect or rectify.

However, there are approaches to potentially help reduce this risk:

* Update your BIOS as soon as vendors release updates. Depending on the manufacturer of your machine(s), you may need to use a specific updater. Download the updates and updater only from trusted vendor resources.
* Enable the most recent hardware Intel BIOS and Boot Guards technologies in your BIOS setup menu. This will prevent and reduce some of the risks of firmware-based attacks.
* For the technically inclined, audit your own BIOS/UEFI firmware! The [CHIPSEC framework](https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec) is a great starting point for identifying the known types of issues and attack vectors.
* Don't leave your laptop unattended in potentially risky or hostile environments.

## GIGABYTE BRIX UEFI firmware fails to implement write protection and is not cryptographically signed

#### Vulnerability Note VU#507496

Original Release Date: 2017-03-31 | Last Revised: 2017-03-31

---

### Overview

GIGABYTE BRIX UEFI firmware for the GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms, versions vF6 and vF2 respectively, fails to properly set the BIOSWE, BLE, SMM\_BWP, and PRx bits to enforce write protection. It also is not cryptographically signed. These issues may permit an attacker to write arbitrary code to the platform firmware, potentially allowing for persistent firmware level rootkits or the creation of a permanent denial of service condition in the platform.

### Description

| [**CWE-693**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)**: Protection Mechanism Failure -** CVE-2017-3197  GIGABYTE UEFI firmware for the [GB-BSi7H-6500](http://www.gigabyte.us/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BSi7H-6500-rev-10#ov) and [GB-BXi7-5775](http://www.gigabyte.us/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BXi7-5775-rev-10#ov) platforms fails to properly set the BIOSWE, BLE, SMM\_BWP, and PRx bits. As a result, the BIOS is not protected from arbitrary write access and may permit modifications to the SPI flash.[**CWE-345**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)**: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity -** CVE-2017-3198GIGABYTE UEFI firmware for the GB-BSi7H-6500 and GB-BXi7-5775 platforms is not cryptographically signed and is served over HTTP from the vendor's support pages without a checksum. An attacker in the position to do so may introduce arbitrary modifications to the firmware that the system has no means to detect.Note that the affected GIGABYTE firmware is a vulnerable implementation of an AMI reference design that does not, by default, appear to be affected by these issues. For more information about these findings, refer to the Cylance advisories, [CLVA-2017-01-001](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2017-01-001.md) and [CLVA-2017-01-002](https://github.com/CylanceVulnResearch/disclosures/blob/master/CLVA-2017-01-002.md). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local, authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of system firmware, potentially allowing for persistent firmware level rootkits or the creation of a permanent denial of service condition in the platform. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The vendor has indicated that firmware version F7 for the GB-BSi7H-6500 will be released in April to address these issues. Users should monitor the [product page](http://www.gigabyte.us/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BSi7H-6500-rev-10) or contact the vendor for update availability.The vendor has indicated that the GB-BXi7-5775 is end of life and will not receive new firmware.The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution for these problems. |
