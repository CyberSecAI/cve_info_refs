Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3735:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided text explicitly mentions "OpenSSL Security Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2017-3735)" within a Tenable Security Advisory, and it is also listed in the description section of a Tenable CVE entry. Therefore, the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

- The vulnerability is a one-byte overread that occurs while parsing a malformed IPAddressFamily extension within an X.509 certificate.
- This is due to an error in how OpenSSL handles the length of the `IPAddressFamily` extension.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability leads to a one-byte overread in memory while processing X.509 certificates with specific extensions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The overread could cause an incorrect text display of a certificate, potentially leaking limited information.
-   **Denial of Service:** While not explicitly stated in all sources, one document mentions that successful exploitation could result in information disclosure or a denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors**

- The primary attack vector is through the parsing of a malformed X.509 certificate. This could be triggered when an application processes a certificate received over a network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

-   The attacker needs the ability to supply a malformed X.509 certificate to a vulnerable application.
-   The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Information (beyond official CVE description):**

-   The vulnerability has existed since 2006 and affects all versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g.
-   Several sources indicate that this vulnerability is considered to be a medium severity issue.
-   Tenable SecurityCenter, Nessus, and various NetApp products were impacted and subsequently patched.
-   Patches for Debian and Ubuntu are available in their respective security advisories.
-   Multiple vendors, including Oracle, Apple, and Siemens have also addressed this vulnerability in their products.
