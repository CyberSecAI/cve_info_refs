Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-3023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of JPEG2000 images within Adobe Reader DC.
- The process does not properly validate user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write:  The lack of proper validation of user-supplied data leads to a write past the end of an allocated object. This is a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader DC.
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process (the user's context).
- The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacks are possible.
- User interaction is required for exploitation: The target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create malicious JPEG2000 images and deliver them to the victim.
- No special privileges are needed. The attacker leverages the user's context after they open the malicious content.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is specifically an out-of-bounds write.
