Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3067:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue due to the misuse of the pre-population service within Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is that the pre-population service in AEM Forms can be exploited to disclose sensitive information. This likely means that the service was not properly restricted, allowing access to files or data that should not be accessible.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:** The pre-population service lacked adequate controls over file paths and protocols it could use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Data Exposure:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the compromise of data security, potentially granting unauthorized access to confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting the pre-population service in AEM Forms. It is implied that an attacker could manipulate this service to gain access to restricted files or data by pre-filling forms with malicious parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need the ability to interact with the pre-population service in AEM Forms. This may include the ability to submit specially crafted requests to the service.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated in order to exploit this vulnerability, according to the text.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" in terms of severity.
*   Adobe provided additional controls in the configuration manager to restrict the file paths and protocols that can be used by the pre-population service to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects AEM Forms versions 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2, across Windows, Linux, Solaris, and AIX platforms.
*   Ruben Reusser of headwire.com is credited for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.
