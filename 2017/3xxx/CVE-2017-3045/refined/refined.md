Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JPEG2000 images within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer due to insufficient validation of the image data.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The root cause is the lack of proper validation on user-supplied data, which allows the attacker to trigger the out-of-bounds read condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially disclose sensitive information stored in memory.
*   **Code Execution (Indirect):** The advisory mentions that an attacker can leverage this vulnerability, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, to achieve code execution. However, this vulnerability on its own does not directly lead to code execution but can be used as a primitive for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, the target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file. This indicates that the attacker would need to entice the user into engaging with malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Malicious File Creation or Webpage Hosting:** The attacker must be capable of creating a malicious JPEG2000 file or hosting a webpage that would trigger the vulnerability when processed by a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to utilize social engineering tactics to persuade the victim to interact with the malicious file or webpage.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2017-02-16 and a coordinated public release of the advisory occurred on 2017-04-11.
* Adobe has released updates to address this vulnerability, and recommends users upgrade their software to the newest version
* The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC
* This CVE is one of many memory corruption vulnerabilities fixed by Adobe.
