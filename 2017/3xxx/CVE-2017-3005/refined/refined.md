Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **unquoted search path** issue in Adobe Photoshop on Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unquoted search path:** The software searches for executables or libraries in directories specified by the system's PATH environment variable. If a path is not enclosed in quotes, an attacker could potentially place a malicious file with the same name as the expected file in an earlier directory in the PATH. Windows will execute this malicious file instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code execution:** By exploiting the unquoted search path, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious file placement:** The attacker needs to place a malicious executable or library file in a directory that appears before the legitimate file's directory in the user's PATH environment variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write access to a directory in the PATH:**  The attacker requires the ability to write files to a directory that is included in the system's PATH variable before the location of the legitimate executable.
*   **User interaction** The user must launch the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (versions 18.0.1 and earlier) and Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.5 (versions 17.0.1 (2015.5.1) and earlier) on Windows.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Cyril Vallicari / HTTPCS â€“ Ziwit.
