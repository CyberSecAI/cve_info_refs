| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation on certain crafted packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to a device that is running a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release that supports the ANI feature.\r\n\r\nA device must meet two conditions to be affected by this vulnerability:\r\n\r\nThe device must be running a version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software that supports ANI (regardless of whether ANI is configured)\r\nThe device must have a reachable IPv6 interface\r\nAn exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Also see the companion advisory for affected devices that are configured as an autonomic registrar: Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Autonomic Networking Infrastructure Registrar Denial of Service Vulnerability [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170320-ani\"]."

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software devices that support the ANI feature. A device must meet two conditions to be affected by this vulnerability:\r\n\r\nThe device must be running a version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software that supports ANI (regardless of whether ANI is configured)\r\nThe device must have a reachable IPv6 interface\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determining Whether an Interface Has an Assigned IPv6 Address\r\nAdministrators can identify interfaces that have assigned IPv6 addresses by using the show ipv6 interface brief command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command on a device with IPv6 enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter# show ipv6 interface brief\r\n. . . GigabitEthernet0/0/0 [Up/Up] fe80::212:daff:fe62:c150 2001:DB8::1\r\n\r\nIf IPv6 is not supported by the software release that is running on a device, use of the show ipv6 interface brief command produces an error message. If IPv6 is not enabled on the device, use of the show ipv6 interface brief command does not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses. In either scenario, the device is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n Determining Whether the Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software Release Supports ANI\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker, that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nA summary view of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software trains that support ANI is in the following tables. However, customers are encouraged to use the Cisco IOS Software Checker to check their releases, as described in the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software Trains That Support ANI\r\n Cisco IOS Software Train Comments 15.2E\r\n 15.2(1)E and 15.2(2)E trains are not affected 15.2EA 15.2(2)EA train is not affected 15.3S 15.3(1)S and 15.3(2)S trains are not affected 15.4S 15.5S 15.5SN 15.6M 15.6S 15.6SN 15.6SP 15.6T\r\nCisco IOS XE Software Trains That Support ANI\r\n Cisco IOS XE Software Train 3.7E\r\n 3.8E 3.9E 3.10S and later trains 16 trains\r\nDetermining Whether the Hardware Platform Supports ANI\r\nIf a device is running an affected software release, administrators are advised to use the show autonomic device command in the CLI to confirm whether the hardware platform supports ANI. The following examples show the output of this command on devices that support ANI:\r\n\r\nExample of Command Output That Indicates ANI Is Supported\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show autonomic device\r\n UDI PID:CSR1000V SN:XXXXXXXXXXX Domain Cert is Not Valid Router>\r\n\r\nAdditional Example of Command Output That Indicates ANI Is Supported\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show autonomic device\r\n Router>\r\n\r\nIf ANI is not supported by the software release that is running on a device, use of the show autonomic device command produces an error message as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\nExample of Command Output That Indicates ANI Is Not Supported\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show autonomic device\r\n ^ % Invalid input detected at '^' marker. Router>\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc. Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod\_rel\_team . . .\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html\"].\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nios-xe-device# show version\r\n Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

"text": "There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. The workaround consists of using an access control list (ACL) to filter IPv6 packets that are sent to the device on UDP port 8888 or UDP port 4936 when the device is not configured for ANI. If the device is configured to use ANI, this workaround does not apply, and customers are advised to update the software on their devices.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of the ACL workaround:\r\n\r\n!\r\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 no ip address ipv6 enable ipv6 traffic-filter drop\_ANI\_IPv6 in ! ipv6 access-list drop\_ANI\_IPv6 deny udp any host  eq 4936 log deny udp any host  eq 8888 log permit any any !\r\n\r\nIn the preceding example,  is an IPv6 address. The ACL must be applied to all interfaces and all IPv6 addresses that are configured. If an interface has more than one IPv6 address configured, all addresses must be covered by the ACLs. This includes all loopback and link-local addresses for each interface."

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S—in the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21\_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_rel\_notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_sys\_req.html#wp3069754\"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL\_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release."

"details": "There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. The workaround consists of using an access control list (ACL) to filter IPv6 packets that are sent to the device on UDP port 8888 or UDP port 4936 when the device is not configured for ANI. If the device is configured to use ANI, this workaround does not apply, and customers are advised to update the software on their devices.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of the ACL workaround:\r\n\r\n!\r\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 no ip address ipv6 enable ipv6 traffic-filter drop\_ANI\_IPv6 in ! ipv6 access-list drop\_ANI\_IPv6 deny udp any host  eq 4936 log deny udp any host  eq 8888 log permit any any !\r\n\r\nIn the preceding example,  is an IPv6 address. The ACL must be applied to all interfaces and all IPv6 addresses that are configured. If an interface has more than one IPv6 address configured, all addresses must be covered by the ACLs. This includes all loopback and link-local addresses for each interface.",

A device must meet two conditions to be affected by this vulnerability:    + The device must be running a version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software that supports ANI (regardless of whether ANI is configured)   + The device must have a reachable IPv6 interface For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory. Determining Whether an Interface Has an Assigned IPv6 Address Administrators can identify interfaces that have assigned IPv6 addresses by using the **show ipv6 interface brief** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command on a device with IPv6 enabled:  ```   router# show ipv6 interface brief   .   .   .   GigabitEthernet0/0/0 [Up/Up]    fe80::212:daff:fe62:c150    2001:DB8::1    ```  If IPv6 is not supported by the software release that is running on a device, use of the **show ipv6 interface brief** command produces an error message. If IPv6 is not enabled on the device, use of the **show ipv6 interface brief** command does not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses. In either scenario, the device is not affected by this vulnerability. Determining Whether the Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software Release Supports ANI To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker, that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”).  A summary view of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software trains that support ANI is in the following tables. However, customers are encouraged to use the Cisco IOS Software Checker to check their releases, as described in the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory.  *Cisco IOS Software Trains That Support ANI*       | Cisco IOS Software Train | Comments |   | --- | --- |   | 15.2E | 15.2(1)E and 15.2(2)E trains are not affected |   | 15.2EA | 15.2(2)EA train is not affected |   | 15.3S | 15.3(1)S and 15.3(2)S trains are not affected |   | 15.4S |  |   | 15.5S |  |   | 15.5SN |  |   | 15.6M |  |   | 15.6S |  |   | 15.6SN |  |   | 15.6SP |  |   | 15.6T |  |       *Cisco IOS XE Software Trains That Support ANI*       | Cisco IOS XE Software Train |   | --- |   | 3.7E |   | 3.8E |   | 3.9E |   | 3.10S and later trains |   | 16 trains |      Determining Whether the Hardware Platform Supports ANI If a device is running an affected software release, administrators are advised to use the **show autonomic device** command in the CLI to confirm whether the hardware platform supports ANI. The following examples show the output of this command on devices that support ANI:  *Example of Command Output That Indicates ANI Is Supported*  ```   Router> show autonomic device                 UDI                            PID:CSR1000V SN:XXXXXXXXXXX             Domain Cert is Not Valid             Router>   ```  *Additional Example of Command Output That Indicates ANI Is Supported*  ```   Router> show autonomic device       Router>   ```  If ANI is not supported by the software release that is running on a device, use of the **show autonomic device** command produces an error message as shown in the following example:  *Example of Command Output That Indicates ANI Is Not Supported*  ```   Router> show autonomic device                     ^   % Invalid input detected at '^' marker.       Router>   ``` Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays *Cisco IOS XE Software* or similar text.  The following example shows the output of the **show version** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.16.1aS:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 03.16.01a.S - Extended Support Release   Cisco IOS Software, ASR1000 Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.5(3)S1a, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Wed 04-Nov-15 17:40 by mcpre   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause an affected device to reload. Exploitation may be confirmed by decoding the stack trace for the device and determining whether the AN process crashed. If the process crashed, device logs will contain an error message similar to the following example :    ```   %Software-forced reload         Exception to IOS Thread:   Frame pointer 0x7F7A1225B3F8, PC = 0x7F7AE51201F7      UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Aborted(6), Process = AN   .   .   .   %SYS-3-OVERRUN: Block overrun at ...      ```  Workarounds  * There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. The workaround consists of using an access control list (ACL) to filter IPv6 packets that are sent to the device on UDP port 8888 or UDP port 4936 when the device is *not* configured for ANI. If the device is configured to use ANI, this workaround does not apply, and customers are advised to update the software on their devices.      The following is an example of the ACL workaround:    ```   !   interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0    no ip address    ipv6 enable    ipv6 traffic-filter drop_ANI_IPv6 in   !   ipv6 access-list drop_ANI_IPv6    deny udp any host  eq 4936 log    deny udp any host  eq 8888 log    permit any any    !   ```    In the preceding example,  is an IPv6 address. The ACL must be applied to all interfaces and all IPv6 addresses that are configured. If an interface has more than one IPv6 address configured, all addresses must be covered by the ACLs. This includes all loopback and link-local addresses for each interface.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.1.4S**-in the following field:               For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.
