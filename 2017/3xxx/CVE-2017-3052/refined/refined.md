Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing EMF (Enhanced Metafile) files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, the issue results in an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data beyond the allocated memory buffer, which is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read sensitive data from the process's memory. This vulnerability can also be used to gain more information about the software to leverage other vulnerabilities.
- Potential for code execution: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability "in conjunction with other vulnerabilities" could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious files: A user could be tricked into opening a specially crafted malicious EMF file.
- Malicious web pages: A user could be tricked into visiting a malicious web page that causes the vulnerable code to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious EMF file or a malicious web page to a user of the vulnerable software. This could involve social engineering or other methods to trick a user into opening a file or visiting a website.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network.
- User interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2017-02-16 and a coordinated public release of the advisory happened on 2017-04-11.
- Adobe released security updates to address the vulnerability on April 6, 2017.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
-  The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader on both Windows and Macintosh.
- The vulnerability is specifically a memory corruption vulnerability that could lead to a memory address leak.
