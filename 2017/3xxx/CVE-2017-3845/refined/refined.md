Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3845

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the web interface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the web interface

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can launch the attack remotely over the network.
- The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable web interface, injecting malicious script code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance software.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to trick a user of the web-based management interface into triggering the malicious script (e.g., through a crafted link).

**Additional Details:**
- The affected Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance software versions are 11.0, 11.1, and 11.5.
- Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning is not affected.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- The CVSS base score is 4.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)
