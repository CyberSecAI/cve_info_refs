Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3200

**Description:**
This CVE is associated with a vulnerability in GraniteDS, a Java AMF3 deserialization library. It is one of several vulnerabilities found in various Java AMF3 libraries.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure deserialization of data, specifically related to how the AMF3 libraries handle the 'dynamic' trait of AMF3 objects. These libraries allow the creation of arbitrary objects by specifying their class name and setting their properties by name and value, similar to JavaBeans functionality. Some implementations use Java's Introspector or similar functionality. Additionally,  the libraries interpret the flash.utils.IExternalizable interface from the AMF3 specification as equivalent to Java's java.io.Externalizable, allowing the reconstruction of any class implementing java.io.Externalizable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502):** Vulnerable implementations of AMF3 deserializers derive class instances from java.io.Externalizable instead of the AMF3 recommendation of flash.utils.IExternalizable. This allows an attacker to send serialized Java objects that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources (CWE-913):** Some implementations allow the instantiation of arbitrary classes through their public parameter-less constructor, followed by calls to arbitrary Java Bean setter methods. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if classes with dangerous setter methods are available in the classpath.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted AMF messages.
*   **Data Exposure:** Although not specifically stated, insecure deserialization vulnerabilities can often lead to data exposure if exploited to access unauthorized resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attacker sends a malicious AMF message containing serialized Java objects to a vulnerable server application. The server deserializes this data using a vulnerable AMF library, which triggers the execution of the attacker's code.
*   **RMI Spoofing/Control:** An attacker with the ability to spoof or control an RMI server connection can leverage the deserialization vulnerability in java.io.Externalizable implementations to trigger the execution of arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send malicious AMF messages.
*   **Control of Data Stream:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the AMF data stream sent to the vulnerable server.
*   **Understanding of Target Application's Classpath:** To fully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker might need knowledge of the classes present in the vulnerable application's classpath to craft a payload that uses available gadgets to achieve RCE

**Specific to CVE-2017-3200 (GraniteDS):**
The provided content indicates that GraniteDS version 3.1.1.GA is specifically vulnerable to both the insecure deserialization and the arbitrary object creation using JavaBean setter methods.

**Additional Details:**
The blog post also highlights how an Externalizable.readExternal call can be turned into an ObjectInputStream.readObject call, exploiting RMI-related classes like sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef/UnicastRef2. This allows the attacker to trigger a chain of deserialization calls that leads to arbitrary code execution.

The CERT advisory VU#307983 further confirms that GraniteDS is affected by insecure deserialization (CVE-2017-3199) and improper control of dynamically managed code resources (CVE-2017-3200). It also highlights that these vulnerabilities could impact other products that use these libraries.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Update/Patch:** Apply the latest security updates and patches to affected software using vulnerable AMF libraries.
*   **Java Version:** Use an updated JDK (JDK 8u121, 7u131 and 6u141 or later) that implements basic serialization blacklisting filters.
*   **Serialization Best Practices:** Be cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources. Follow secure coding practices for serialization.
*   **Network Restrictions:** Restrict network access to applications that use these libraries.
