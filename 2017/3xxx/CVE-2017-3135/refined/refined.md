Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3135:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from multiple sources directly references CVE-2017-3135 and describes a vulnerability related to BIND, specifically involving the combination of DNS64 and Response Policy Zones (RPZ), matching the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an inconsistency in query processing within BIND when both DNS64 and RPZ are active. This inconsistency arises when BIND rewrites query responses using both features, leading to a flawed state that causes a crash. Specifically, the vulnerability can lead to either an assertion failure or a NULL pointer dereference.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Inconsistent State**:  When both DNS64 and RPZ are enabled, BIND can enter an inconsistent state during query processing after rewriting responses.
-   **Assertion Failure**: Due to the inconsistent state, an assertion failure can occur, which abruptly terminates the BIND process (named).
-   **NULL Pointer Dereference**: In certain cases, the inconsistent state can lead to an attempt to read through a NULL pointer, resulting in a segmentation fault and process termination.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the BIND server (named process), effectively causing a denial of service. This means the DNS server becomes unavailable, preventing name resolution for clients.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Specially Crafted DNS Query**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted DNS query to a BIND resolver that is configured with both DNS64 and RPZ.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote Attacker**: A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability with a crafted query without needing any prior authentication.
-   **Network Access**: The attacker needs to have network access to send DNS queries to the vulnerable BIND server.
-   **No Special Privileges Required**: No specific user privileges are necessary.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   **Uncommon Configuration:** It is noted that the combined use of DNS64 and RPZ is uncommon, thus reducing the number of vulnerable systems.
*   **Red Hat Advisory:** Red Hat assigned a "Moderate" severity to the issue and detailed the affected Red Hat products in [RHSA-2017:0276](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0276).

*   **Gentoo Advisory**: Gentoo security advisory [201708-01](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201708-01) addressed this along with other CVE's impacting BIND.
*   **Upstream Acknowledgement:** The upstream fix acknowledges Ramesh Damodaran (Infoblox) and Aliaksandr Shubnik (Infoblox) as the original reporters of the vulnerability.
*   **Red Hat Bugzilla**: Red Hat tracked this issue via [bug 1420193](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420193) which provides extra information such as the patch.
*  **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability was given a CVSSv3 score of 7.5(High) with vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H by NetApp.

In summary, CVE-2017-3135 describes a vulnerability in ISC BIND where a remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a crash by sending a specially crafted DNS query when DNS64 and RPZ are both configured. This is a denial-of-service vulnerability that is addressed by updates from affected distributions.
