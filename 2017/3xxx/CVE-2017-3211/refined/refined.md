Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3211

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Yopify plugin's design, where customer data is directly fetched from Yopify servers and embedded within a JavaScript widget, without any user authorization or proper access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintentional disclosure of customer data. The plugin exposed the first name, last initial, city, and recent purchase data of customers. Initially, it also exposed the full last names and city-level geolocation.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** The JavaScript widget containing customer data could be accessed by anyone with knowledge of the site-specific API key, which was easily extracted from the e-commerce site's source code. No user authentication or authorization was required to access the data.
*   **Insecure Data Handling:** The widget retrieved the customer data as a JSON blob. While initially base64 encoded (which is not encryption), it was easily decoded, and initially contained more data than displayed on the website pop-up, like full last name and city-level geolocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Breach:** Attackers could easily collect sensitive personal data about customers by scraping the API key and periodically polling the Yopify servers.
*   **Targeted Attacks:** The information obtained could be used to target specific users of specific e-commerce sites with phishing, social engineering or other attacks.
*   **Data Accumulation:** Attackers could build databases of customer information over time.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker does not need access to the e-commerce platform. They can scrape the API key from the target website's source code and make API requests to Yopify servers.
*   **API Request:**  The attack vector involves sending an HTTP GET request to the Yopify API endpoint with the site's API key to obtain the JSON blob containing customer data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Target Site:** The attacker needs to identify an e-commerce site using the vulnerable Yopify plugin.
*   **Basic Web Scraping Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to scrape the API key from the website's HTML source code.
*   **Ability to Make HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Yopify API to retrieve the JSON data.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No user authentication or prior authorization is required to conduct the attack.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially mitigated by base64 encoding, which is not effective security. A second patch was later deployed, removing the full last name from the data.
* The blog post mentions the vulnerability was discovered on Feb 28, 2017 and publicly disclosed on May 31, 2017, with several attempts to contact the vendor.
