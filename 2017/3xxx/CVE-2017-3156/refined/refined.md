{
  "CVE-2017-3156": {
    "Root cause": "The Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code does not use a constant-time MAC signature comparison algorithm.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Sophisticated timing attacks could potentially exploit the vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Timing attacks on MAC signature comparisons.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to perform timing attacks to exploit this vulnerability and this will mostly affect OAuth2 Hawk, JWT access tokens, or JOSE JWS/JWE interceptors which depend on HMAC secret key algorithms."
