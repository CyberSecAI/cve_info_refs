RHSA-2017:1832 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2017-08-10
Updated:
2017-08-10
# RHSA-2017:1832 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.3 R4 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that the hawtio servlet uses a single HttpClient instance to proxy requests with a persistent cookie store (cookies are stored locally and are not passed between the client and the end URL) which means all clients using that proxy are sharing the same cookies. (CVE-2017-2589)
* It was found that an information disclosure flaw in Bouncy Castle could enable a local malicious application to gain access to user's private information. (CVE-2015-6644)
* It was found that Apache Camel's camel-jackson and camel-jacksonxml components are vulnerable to Java object de-serialisation vulnerability. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues. (CVE-2016-8749)
* It was found that Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded / to a request an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. (CVE-2016-9879)
* It was found that a path traversal vulnerability in hawtio leads to a NullPointerException with a full stacktrace. An attacker could use this flaw to gather undisclosed information from within hawtio's root. (CVE-2017-2594)
* It was found that Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code is not using a constant time MAC signature comparison algorithm which may be exploited by some sophisticated timing attacks. It may only affect OAuth2 Hawk, JWT access tokens, or JOSE JWS/JWE interceptors which depend on HMAC secret key algorithms. (CVE-2017-3156)
* It was found that Apache Camel's validation component evaluates DTD headers of XML stream sources, although a validation against XML schemas (XSD) is executed. Remote attackers can use this feature to make Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by sending XML documents with remote DTDs URLs or XML External Entities (XXE). (CVE-2017-5643)
* It was found that a flaw exists in JAX-RS clients using the streaming approach for XML signatures and encryption, where it does not enforce the message to be signed/encrypted. This could allow an attacker to subvert the integrity of the message. (CVE-2017-5653)
* It was found that the token cacher in Apache cxf uses a flawed way of caching tokens that are associated with the delegation token received from Security Token Service (STS). This vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a token which could return an identifier corresponding to a cached token for another user. (CVE-2017-5656)
* It was found that logback is vulnerable to a deserialization issue. Logback can be configured to allow remote logging through SocketServer/ServerSocketReceiver interfaces that can accept untrusted serialized data. Authenticated attackers on the adjacent network can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code through deserialization of custom gadget chains. (CVE-2017-5929)
* It was found that XStream contains a vulnerability that allows a maliciously crafted file to be parsed successfully which could cause an application crash. The crash occurs if the file that is being fed into XStream input stream contains an instances of the primitive type 'void'. An attacker could use this flaw to create a denial of service on the target system. (CVE-2017-7957)

The CVE-2017-2589 issue was discovered by Adam Willard (Blue Canopy) and Dennis Reed (Red Hat) and the CVE-2017-2594 issue was discovered by Hooman Broujerdi (Red Hat).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
CVE-2017-3156: Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code is vulnerable to the timing attacks
Severity: Major
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions Affected:
This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.0.13, 3.1.10.
Description:
Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code is not using a constant time MAC signature
comparison algorithm which may be exploited by some sophisticated timing attacks. It may only affect
OAuth2 Hawk or JWT access tokens or JOSE JWS/JWE interceptors which depend on HMac secret key algorithms.
This has been fixed in revisions:
CXF 3.1.x:
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/555843f9
CXF 3.0.x
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/1338469f
CXF 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT (master):
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/e66ce235
Credit:
The issue was reported and the patch provided by Richard Kettelerij.
Migration:
CXF 3.0.x users should upgrade to 3.0.13 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 3.1.x users should upgrade to 3.1.10 or later as soon as possible.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-21 13:23:01 UTC  ``` Apache CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code is not using a constant time MAC signature comparison algorithm which may be exploited by some sophisticated timing attacks. It may only affect OAuth2 Hawk or JWT access tokens or JOSE JWS/JWE interceptors which depend on HMac secret key algorithms.  This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.0.13, 3.1.10.  Upstream patches:  CXF 3.1.x: <http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/555843f9>  CXF 3.0.x <http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/1338469f>  CXF 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT (master): <http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cxf/commit/e66ce235>  External References:  <https://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2017-3156.txt.asc>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-21 13:31:30 UTC  ``` Created cxf tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425458](show_bug.cgi?id=1425458 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-3156 cxf: CXF OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE MAC Validation code are vulnerable to timing attacks [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c4)  Hamed Farid    2017-04-03 07:36:23 UTC  ``` Thanks Adam , I have two questions 1- If I use vulnerable CXF version like 3.0.12 but I don't use OAuth2 Hawk and JOSE , should I still be vulnerable ? 2- Is this finding affects only Linux systems ?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c5)  Hooman Broujerdi    2017-05-02 05:10:48 UTC  ``` Hi Hamed,  Sorry for the delay getting back to you on this, to answer your questions: 1) No you are not vulnerable, basically there multiple access token types which can be used in cxf oauth2 and MAC and HAWK are among those token types so if you do not use them then you are not vulnerable. 2) Not necessarily linux systems, cxf oauth2 lib is affected and any application that utilizes this lib and uses the HAWK and MAC  token types could potentially be impacted.  Hope this helps.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c6)  Hamed Farid    2017-05-02 05:17:29 UTC  ``` Thanks for your response   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-10 23:03:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2017:1832 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1832](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1832)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c8)  Joshua Padman    2019-05-15 22:46:06 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following products:  * Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6  * Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 5  * Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 6  * Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3  Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes> for more details.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1425455#c9)  Joshua Padman    2019-06-19 05:57:25 UTC  ``` Whilst Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 7 and Red Hat SSO both include components of cxf the oauth2 components are not included.   ``` |  |
