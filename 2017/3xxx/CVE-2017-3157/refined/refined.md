(CVE) ID: CVE-2017-3157
CVE Description: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

The provided content contains information about CVE-2017-3157.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by the way LibreOffice handles embedded objects. Specifically, previews of embedded objects, which can be links to local files, are updated to reflect the content of the linked file when the document is opened.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Arbitrary file disclosure through the preview of an embedded object.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could craft a document with an embedded object that links to a file on the target system. When the document is opened, the preview of the object updates to display the contents of the targeted local file. This can be used to expose details of the target system, especially if LibreOffice is running as an online service or if the document is saved and returned to the attacker.

Attack vectors:
Crafted document containing a malicious embedded object.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted document to the victim and needs to know or guess the path to the file they want to access on the target system.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability is present in LibreOffice Calc and Writer.
- Later versions of LibreOffice expanded the LinkUpdateMode feature to also control the update of previews of embedded objects.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ben Hayak.
- Patches were released for several distributions, including Red Hat and Debian.
- Red Hat rated the impact as Moderate.
- Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.3 and older are affected, and the fix was included in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4.
