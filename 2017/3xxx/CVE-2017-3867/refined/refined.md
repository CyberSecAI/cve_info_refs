Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3867

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) implementation within Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is an ACL bypass, allowing specific TCP and UDP traffic to circumvent access control lists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass ACLs for specific TCP and UDP traffic, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing other security breaches.
- The impact is rated as a low impact to integrity (`I:L`) and no impact to confidentiality or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
- The attack complexity is low (`AC:L`), making it relatively easy to exploit.
- No privileges or user interaction are needed to execute the attack (`PR:N`, `UI:N`).
- The scope is changed (`S:C`) because a successful attack can impact resources beyond the vulnerable component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco ASA device.
- The attacker does not require any authentication or specific user interaction.
- The attacker must target TCP or UDP traffic on ports 3784 and 3785 to trigger the bypass (based on the workaround).

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS score is 5.8 (Medium), with a vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N`.
*   **Workaround:** Cisco suggests explicitly blocking TCP and UDP traffic on ports 3784 and 3785 on the ingress ACL of the relevant interfaces to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software. The specific affected software releases can be found using the provided Cisco bug ID.
*   **No Public Exploitation:** At the time of the advisory, Cisco was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
