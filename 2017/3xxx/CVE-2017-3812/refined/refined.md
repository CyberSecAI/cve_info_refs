Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) functionality within Cisco Industrial Ethernet 2000 Series Switches. This faulty implementation leads to a system memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak: The flawed CIP implementation causes a memory leak that depletes system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful attack will cause a denial of service condition due to the system memory leak, rendering the device inoperable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The attack can be launched remotely over a network.
- Unauthenticated: An attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: An attacker must have network access to the affected device.
- No authentication required: The attacker does not need any prior knowledge or valid credentials for the device.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the CIP implementation of Cisco Industrial Ethernet 2000 Series Switches that can be exploited remotely, without authentication, to cause a DoS.
