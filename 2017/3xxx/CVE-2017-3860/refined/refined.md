Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-3860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to multiple buffer overflow conditions within the EnergyWise module of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the EnergyWise module.
- The vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending specifically crafted IPv4 packets.
- The EnergyWise feature is not enabled by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- The device may experience a buffer overflow causing a crash and reload of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities via IPv4 packets.
- The packets can be sent over TCP or UDP port 43440, which is the default port for EnergyWise communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to a device configured with EnergyWise.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- EnergyWise uses UDP port 43440 for neighbor discovery and TCP port 43440 for management and control messages. These ports can be changed using specific configuration commands, but the default port is 43440 for all EnergyWise communication channels, which can be the target for the attack.
- The vulnerabilities can be triggered via neighbor discovery packets (UDP), management packets (TCP), or control messages to endpoints (TCP).
- Exploiting these vulnerabilities leads to the device reloading and generating a crashinfo file.
- Affected devices are Cisco devices running affected versions of IOS or IOS XE software where EnergyWise is enabled.
- IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger the vulnerabilities.
