## Pandora iOS app does not properly validate SSL certificates

#### Vulnerability Note VU#342303

Original Release Date: 2017-03-28 | Last Revised: 2017-04-13

---

### Overview

The Pandora iOS app fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which may enable an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

### Description

| [**CWE-295**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)**: Improper Certificate Validation -** CVE-2017-3194  [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/) is a streaming music service. On iOS devices, the Pandora app fails to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which means that an attacker in the position to perform MITM attacks may be able to obtain sensitive account information such as login credentials. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the same network as the iOS device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS, which may lead to the exposure of sensitive account information, including login credentials. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  Pandora has released iOS app version 8.3.2 which addresses this issue. Affected users should update their Pandora app as soon as possible. |
| --- |

| **Do not use affected versions of the application**The features and services provided by the application are likely accessible via the Pandora web site. By using a web browser to access those resources, you may avoid situations where SSL is not validated.**Avoid untrusted networks**Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack. |

# Pandora Apple app vulnerable to MITM attacks

March 29, 2017Share[By Doug Olenick](/contributor/doug-olenick)

A [vulnerability note](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/342303) was issued by CERT/CC for the Pandora music streaming service's Apple iOS app for failing to properly validate SSL certificates provided by an HTTPS connection.

The flaw, CVE-2017-3194, if exploited could enable someone to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. Essentially, the vulnerability allows an attacker operating on the same network as the [iOS](https://www.scworld.com/search/apple%2Bios/daterange-12m/m/) device to modify traffic that would normally be protected by HTTPS. However, with this protective layer not in place secure information, including login credentials can be leaked or extracted.

There is no known solution for this issue, but the vulnerability note suggests Pandora users access the service directly through the service's website and not the app in order to avoid the SSL validation issue.

Pandora was notified of the situation on February 7.

Such lagging vulnerability remediation for ProxyLogon significantly contrasts patching activities for a pair of Ivanti flaws also leveraged in Salt Typhoon attacks, tracked as CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887, which have been addressed in over 92% of affected Ivanti devices, findings from Tenable revealed.
