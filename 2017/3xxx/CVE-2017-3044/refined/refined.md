Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper parsing of JPEG2000 images within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate user-supplied data during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The lack of input validation allows a crafted JPEG2000 image to cause a write operation beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user running Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File: An attacker could embed the crafted JPEG2000 image within a malicious PDF file and trick the victim into opening the file.
- Malicious Page: An attacker can host the malicious JPEG2000 on a website that is visited by the victim through a browser using a PDF plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF file containing a crafted JPEG2000 image or host it on a web page to a user running a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- User interaction is required: The user must open the malicious PDF file or visit the malicious web page.
