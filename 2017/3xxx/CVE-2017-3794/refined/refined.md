**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3794

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*  The Cisco WebEx Meetings Server is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to potentially execute actions on behalf of an administrative user without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform actions on the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server using the permissions of an administrative user. The specific actions are not detailed, but could involve modifying configurations, creating users, or other administrative tasks. The impact is an integrity impact, specifically a loss of integrity as the attacker can change settings on the system. The confidentiality and availability are listed as not impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Remote, network-based attack.
* The attacker does not need prior authentication

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker must be able to send crafted requests to the affected Cisco WebEx Meetings Server. This can be achieved by tricking a logged-in administrative user into interacting with a malicious link or web page controlled by the attacker, or by directly sending the crafted request if the user's browser is not protected against CSRF.

**Additional Information:**
