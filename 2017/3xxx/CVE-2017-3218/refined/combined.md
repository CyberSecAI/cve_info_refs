## Samsung Magician fails to update itself securely

#### Vulnerability Note VU#846320

Original Release Date: 2017-06-15 | Last Revised: 2017-06-15

---

### Overview

Samsung Magician fails to securely check for and retrieve updates, which an allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges.

### Description

| [Samsung Magician](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/consumer/magician.html) is a management utility for Samsung SSDs. Prior to version 5.0, Samsung Magician checks for and retrieves updates over HTTP. Prior to version 5.1, Samsung Magician uses HTTPS to perform update operations, however it does not validate SSL certificates. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the same network as, or who can otherwise affect network traffic from, a Samsung Magician user can cause the Magician update process to execute arbitrary code with system administrator privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in [Samsung Magician 5.1](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/download/tools.html). Note that because the update mechanism is vulnerable, do not use the self-update mechanism for Samsung Magician to obtain the fixed version. |
| --- |

| **Avoid untrusted networks**Avoid using untrusted networks, including public WiFi. Using your device on an untrusted network increases the chance of falling victim to a MITM attack. |
