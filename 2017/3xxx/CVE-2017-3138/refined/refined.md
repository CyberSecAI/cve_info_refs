Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a REQUIRE assertion failure within the BIND DNS server when it receives a null command string on its control channel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of null command strings on the control channel.
- Potential for an assertion failure leading to termination of the BIND process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation results in the BIND process exiting due to an assertion failure, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: A remote attacker can send a crafted request to the BIND DNS server control channel to trigger the vulnerability.
- Control channel: The vulnerability is triggered through the BIND's control channel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the BIND server.
- Ability to send crafted commands to the BIND control channel, although the provided information does not specify if authentication is required.
- As per NetApp advisory, low privileged users could trigger the vulnerability: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`

**Additional details:**
- The Debian Security Advisory mentions that the fix applied in Debian is primarily a hardening measure, implying that the underlying issue might not be completely resolved with a simple patch.
- The NetApp advisory confirms that multiple products are affected which incorporate the vulnerable ISC BIND libraries.
- The Gentoo advisory references the CVE and states the vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
- A reference to the ISC Knowledge base article (https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01471) is provided for further details regarding the vulnerability, specifically for the fix from ISC itself.
