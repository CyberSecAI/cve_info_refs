Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3210:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure default permissions in applications developed using the Portrait Displays SDK (versions 2.30 through 2.34). Specifically, the `pdiservice.exe` component runs with `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM` permissions, but is also read/writable by all Authenticated Users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** The primary vulnerability is the assignment of overly permissive access controls to the `pdiservice.exe` component.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The combination of SYSTEM privileges for the service and write access for authenticated users creates an opportunity for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local, authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code with `SYSTEM` privileges. This gives the attacker complete control over the affected system, including access to all data, the ability to install software, and to modify operating system settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log into the machine with a valid user account.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker modifies or replaces the `pdiservice.exe` file since it is writable by all authenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a user account on the local system.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to interact with the machine locally to manipulate the `pdiservice.exe` file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in several applications built with the Portrait Displays SDK, including:
    *   Fujitsu DisplayView Click (versions 6.0 and 6.01)
    *   Fujitsu DisplayView Click Suite (version 5)
    *   HP Display Assistant (version 2.1)
    *   HP My Display (version 2.0)
    *   Philips Smart Control Premium (versions 2.23, 2.25)
*   The issue was fixed in later versions of these applications.
*   A workaround is also provided that can manually remove the read/write permissions from Authenticated Users.
