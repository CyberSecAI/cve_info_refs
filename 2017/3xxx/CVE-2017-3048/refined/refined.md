Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-3048:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the parsing of TIFF images in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   Specifically, it's due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, where the application attempts to write beyond the allocated memory buffer in the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. The code runs under the context of the current user, potentially granting the attacker control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file (specifically, a TIFF image) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious TIFF file or host a malicious page containing a malicious TIFF image.
*   The attacker must then induce the victim to open this file or visit this page using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-17-272 and ZDI-CAN-4488 by the Zero Day Initiative.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '27750'.
