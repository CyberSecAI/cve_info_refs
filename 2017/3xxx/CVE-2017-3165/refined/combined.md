# CVE-2017-3165: Cross-site vulnerabilities in Apache Brooklyn

## Severity

Major

## Vendor

The Apache Software Foundation

## Versions Affected

Apache Brooklyn 0.9.0 and all prior versions

## Description

Apache Brooklynâs REST server is vulnerable to cross-site scripting where one authenticated user can cause scripts to run in the browser of another user authorized to access the first userâs resources. This is due to improper escaping of server-side content. There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this vulnerability.

## Solution

Upgrade to Apache Brooklyn 0.10.0. This includes commit correctly escaping text and other content provided by a user to prevent untrusted javascript from executing in the browser.

## Temporary mitigation if you cannot upgrade to 0.10.0

Do not share a Brooklyn server with untrusted users without an enhanced entitlements scheme.

## Example exploit

Attacking user deploys an entity with a name `<script>alert(0);</script>`. Any user browsing that entity will have the `alert(0);` script executed.

## Credit

This vulnerability was discovered by Toshitsugu Yoneyama of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc., and reported to JPCERT/CC who reported them to the Apache Software Foundation on his behalf.

## Other references

JPCERT/CC JVN#55489964
