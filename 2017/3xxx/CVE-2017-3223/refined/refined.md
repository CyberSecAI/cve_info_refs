- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sonia web interface application on Dahua IP cameras does not validate the length of the 'password' field in POST requests, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially achieve out-of-bounds memory operations, leading to loss of availability (denial of service) or remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request with an overly long password to the vulnerable web interface of the Dahua IP camera.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the IP camera's web interface. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
