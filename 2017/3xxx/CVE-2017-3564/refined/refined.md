Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-3564:

**1. Verification:**

The provided document is an Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory for April 2017. It lists many CVEs that were addressed, and CVE-2017-3564 is indeed present in the risk matrix for **Solaris**. Therefore, this content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** implementation of the Solaris operating system.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: An unspecified issue within the RBAC mechanism. The specific flaw is not disclosed but the impact suggests that the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the ability to gain high privileges and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

*  **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is *local*, meaning an attacker needs to have some form of access to the system in order to exploit the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to a vulnerable Solaris system. They would also need to have a certain level of privilege to attempt to exploit the vulnerability (indicated by "Required" for "Privs Req'd" in the risk matrix), but the vulnerability allows the attacker to escalate their privileges. It also seems that the user must interact with the system in a specific way to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is *not remotely exploitable without authentication* meaning an attacker must already have a foothold on the target system.
* CVSS v3 base score is 8.2, and the scope is noted as changed, meaning a successful exploit will result in the attacker having higher privileges than before.
*   The advisory recommends applying patches as soon as possible due to the potential risk involved.

**Summary of CVE-2017-3564:**
The CVE describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Role-Based Access Control of the Solaris operating system that can be exploited by an attacker who already has local access to the system. The impact of successful exploitation is high, leading to a complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.
