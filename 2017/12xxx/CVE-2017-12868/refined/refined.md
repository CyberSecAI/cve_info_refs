Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of the `SimpleSAML\Utils\Crypto::secureCompare()` function in SimpleSAMLphp versions 1.14.12 and 1.14.13 when running on PHP versions older than 5.6. This function was intended to perform a constant-time comparison to prevent timing side-channel attacks.
*   The core issue was that individual bytes of the input strings were not properly converted to integers before being XORed. In PHP versions before 5.6, XORing two characters results in an empty string. The subsequent bitwise OR operation with an empty string resulted in 0.  Thus, the comparison function always returned `true` for strings of the same length, regardless of their content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Constant-Time Comparison:** The `secureCompare()` function was intended to be resistant to timing side-channel attacks, but due to the flawed implementation, it failed to provide the expected security.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass session validation and authentication mechanisms, as the comparison function used to validate session cookies and user credentials would always return true for strings of the same length, regardless of their content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Fixation Attacks:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability to conduct session fixation attacks by manipulating the session cookie. Because the comparison was flawed, an attacker can use a pre-existing session ID, gaining access to the victim's session.
*   **Authentication Bypass in `authcrypt` module:** Attackers could bypass authentication when using the `authcrypt` module with passwords hashed using the `crypt()` algorithm, gaining access to any account using a random password.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted requests containing specific session tokens or credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SimpleSAMLphp application.
*   **Understanding of the application and flawed logic:** The attacker needs to know the system uses the vulnerable `secureCompare()` function for authentication and session management.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in SimpleSAMLphp versions 1.14.12 and 1.14.13.
*   The vulnerability was only present when using PHP versions older than 5.6
*   The fix involved correcting the conversion of characters to integer before comparing them, ensuring proper XOR operation.
*   The vulnerability was initially an improper fix of CVE-2017-12872.
