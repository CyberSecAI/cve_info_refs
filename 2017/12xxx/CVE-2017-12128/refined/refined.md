- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Moxa EDR-810 device's server agent discloses sensitive system information when it receives a TCP packet with the byte 0x21 on port 4000. The device calls the "DoShowInfo" function, gathers system info, and sends it back to the client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Intentional Information Exposure (CWE-213) due to the device's response to a specific byte sequence with sensitive information without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain sensitive information about the device, such as the model, name, serial number, firmware version, location, LAN address, netmask, gateway, and MAC address, without authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted TCP packet containing the byte `0x21` to the device on TCP port 4000.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the device on port 4000. No authentication or special privileges are required.
