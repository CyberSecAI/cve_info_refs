- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow occurs in the `Sass::Eval::operator()` function within the libsass library. This function recursively evaluates expressions, and a crafted input can cause excessive recursion, leading to a stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow vulnerability due to uncontrolled recursion.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and crash of the `sassc` process. In a real-world scenario, this could lead to denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input to the `sassc` command-line utility. The provided POC, "POC9", is an example of such an input file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `sassc` tool to trigger the vulnerability.
