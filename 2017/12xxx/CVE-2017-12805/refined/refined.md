Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-12805:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a memory exhaustion issue within the `ReadTIFFImage` function in ImageMagick. This function improperly handles certain malformed TIFF image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The `ReadTIFFImage` function fails to properly manage memory allocation when processing specially crafted TIFF images. This leads to excessive memory consumption.
*   **Denial of Service:** The uncontrolled memory allocation can result in a denial of service (DoS) condition due to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the ImageMagick application to crash or become unresponsive due to excessive memory usage, thus rendering the application unusable.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The system on which ImageMagick is running could experience a significant performance decrease due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF Image:** An attacker crafts a malformed TIFF image designed to trigger excessive memory allocation when processed by ImageMagick.
*   **User Interaction:** The user or automated system must attempt to open the specially crafted TIFF image file with ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TIFF image file to an application that uses ImageMagick to process images.
*   No special privileges are needed by the attacker to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.6-6.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered both locally, by using a crafted image file as input to an application, and potentially remotely via a network interface.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by applying patches to ImageMagick, fixing the memory handling issue in `ReadTIFFImage`.

**Affected Software:**

*   GraphicsMagick
*   ImageMagick
*   Various Linux distributions that include vulnerable versions of GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick such as Fedora, SUSE, Ubuntu, and Debian.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to patched versions of ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick which are listed in the advisories.
