Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of XML External Entities (XXE) within Apache Lucene, which is utilized by Apache Solr. Specifically, the XML query parser in Lucene does not restrict doctype declarations and external entity expansion. This flaw is further exploited by using Solr's Config API with the `add-listener` command to reach the `RunExecutableListener` class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The Lucene XML parser is vulnerable to XXE injection, allowing an attacker to potentially include special entities in the XML document that can point to external files (via `file://`) or URLs (via `http://`).
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the XXE vulnerability with Solr's Config API, an attacker can leverage the `RunExecutableListener` class to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server. This class enables the execution of arbitrary commands upon specific events, notably after each update query (`postCommit` event).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Solr server by chaining together the XXE vulnerability and the `RunExecutableListener`.
- **Data Breach:** Via XXE, an attacker can potentially read local files and access sensitive data.
- **Arbitrary HTTP Requests:** An attacker can make arbitrary HTTP requests to the local SOLR instance, bypassing firewall restrictions.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the vulnerability, it's possible to trigger resource exhaustion or application instability that could lead to a denial of service.
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server due to arbitrary code execution.
- **Cache Poisoning, XSS, and Data Theft:** Incomplete fix of CVE-2017-2666 allowed for HTTP Response injection that could lead to poisoning of web caches, enabling XSS attacks or theft of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed XML Input:** Attackers inject malicious XML containing external entities using the "xmlparser" parameter to trigger the XXE vulnerability.
- **Solr Config API:** Attackers use the config API to add a malicious listener (`RunExecutableListener`).
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker crafts HTTP POST or GET requests to exploit the vulnerability, with the main vulnerability lying in the Solr's "/select" endpoint.
- **Chaining Vulnerabilities:** By chaining XXE with configuration API abuse, attackers achieve RCE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the Solr server's API.
- **Knowledge of Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs an understanding of both the XML parser's vulnerabilities and the Solr Config API.
- **HTTP Request Crafting:** The attacker must be able to construct specially crafted HTTP requests, containing the malicious XML and API calls.
- **No authentication:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Stepankin and Olga Barinova.
- The mitigation for this is to restart Solr instance with the system parameter `-Ddisable.configEdit=true`
