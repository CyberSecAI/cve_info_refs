Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12245:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an error in how the Firepower Detection Snort Engine handles SSL traffic decryption and notifications to and from the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) handler. Specifically, a memory leak occurs during SSL decryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak in the Firepower Detection Snort Engine when processing SSL traffic.
*   **Improper Handling of Notifications:**  The vulnerability arises from an error in how the Snort Engine communicates with the ASA handler regarding SSL decryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit leads to the depletion of system memory. If the memory leak persists, the device will eventually run out of memory, causing traffic to cease forwarding, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring authentication.
*   **Malicious SSL Traffic:** The attack vector involves sending a steady stream of malicious SSL traffic through the vulnerable device.
*   **Traffic Inspection Configuration**: The vulnerability is exploitable when devices are configured with one or more SSL inspection policies with "Decrypt and Resign" or "Known Key" options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable Cisco device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Understanding of SSL Traffic:** The attacker needs to craft or manipulate SSL traffic to trigger the memory leak.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software releases 6.0.1 and later on ASA 5500-X series, Firepower 2100, 4100, and 9300 series appliances when configured for SSL inspection policies with decrypt and resign or known key options.
*   The advisory provides specific CLI commands to detect if a device is compromised (e.g., `show blocks`, `show asp inspect-dp snort queues detail debug`, `show asp inspect-dp snort counters debug zeros`).
*   Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   The CVSS score is 8.6, categorized as high severity.
