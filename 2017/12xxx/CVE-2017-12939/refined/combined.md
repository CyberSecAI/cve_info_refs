At Unity we understand that your game assets are critical to your business. That is why when you put your trust in us to store or build your game we take as many precautions as possible. From having regular security testing of our services and making sure user assets are securely stored and separated, we take the protection of your assets very seriously.

## Responsible Disclosure

Unity has adopted a Responsible Disclosure policy as a part of our cooperation with internal and external security researchers and Bug Bounty program. Unity may withhold information about an identified vulnerability for a reasonable period of time to ensure that all customers are given time to patch their systems.
