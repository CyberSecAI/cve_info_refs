```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a memory leak that occurs when memory allocation for either `comp` or `complen` fails but the other allocation is not freed. Specifically, the code attempts to allocate memory for both `p->comp` and `p->complen`. If one of these allocations fails, the allocated memory for the other is not released, leading to a memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-772"
    ],
    "impact": "A context-dependent attacker can cause a denial of service by leveraging the failure to allocate memory for either the `comp` or `complen` structure member, resulting in memory consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send network packets that trigger the allocation and subsequent failure to cause the memory leak. No special privileges or user interaction is required."
