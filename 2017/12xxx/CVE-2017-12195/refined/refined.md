  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2017-12195",
    "description": "An attacker with knowledge of the given name used to authenticate and access Elasticsearch can later access it without the token, bypassing authentication. This attack also requires that the Elasticsearch be configured with an external route, and the data accessed is limited to the indices.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.4",
      "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.5",
      "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.6",
      "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.7"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Elasticsearch authentication mechanism failed to invalidate access tokens, allowing authenticated users with a known name to bypass subsequent authentication checks. This only occurs when Elasticsearch is exposed via an external route.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with knowledge of the given name used to authenticate and access Elasticsearch can later access it without the token, bypassing authentication.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation requires that Elasticsearch be configured with an external route."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires knowledge of the name used to authenticate to Elasticsearch initially.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability is specific to the Elasticsearch component exposed through an external route. It allows access only to the data within Elasticsearch indices, not to the whole system or other services. This information is extracted from the provided bugzilla entries and the official Red Hat Security Advisory. The fix involves modifying the Elasticsearch plugin to require authentication even after an initial login."
