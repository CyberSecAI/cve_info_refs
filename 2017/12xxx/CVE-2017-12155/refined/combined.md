# TripleO deploys ceph client keyring with 644 permissions

Bug #1720787 reported by
[John Fulton](https://launchpad.net/~jfulton-org)
on 2017-10-02

[10](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

|  | [tripleo](https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo) | Fix Released | High | [Keith Schincke](https://launchpad.net/~keith-schincke) | [tripleo queens-rc1](https://launchpad.net/tripleo/%2Bmilestone/queens-rc1) |

### Bug Description

When following steps to deploy OpenStack with Ceph, either an external ceph cluster or one deployed by TripleO:

<https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/advanced_deployment/ceph_config.html>

 <https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/advanced_deployment/ceph_external.html>

The ceph.client.openstack.keyring permissions is world readable in all overcloud nodes.

[root@overcloud-compute-1 ~]# ls -ltZ /etc/ceph/

  -rw-r--r--. root root system\_u:object\_r:etc\_t:s0 ceph.conf

  -rw-------. root root system\_u:object\_r:etc\_t:s0 ceph.client.admin.keyring

  -rw-r--r--. root root system\_u:object\_r:etc\_t:s0 ceph.client.openstack.keyring <-- All user can read this keyring.

  -rwxr-xr-x. root root unconfined\_u:object\_r:etc\_t:s0 rbdmap

This means that any local user can access to ceph cluster as 'client.openstack'. Though there is no remote exploit and if there is local access to overcloud nodes there is a bigger problem, the permissions on this key could be more restrictive; e.g. 600 with ACLs set to allow users like Nova, Cinder, etc to read they key.

This bug requires different fixes depending on if the deployment is containerized or not.

Containerized deployment:

1. have kolla copy in the key files so that they are owned by the user in each container, e.g. nova, cinder, etc and chmod 600

- <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/508975/>

Non-containerized deployemtn:

2. update THT to indicate that the keys should be chmod 600 but also set ACLs for each user; e.g. nova, cinder, etc

- <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/509020/>

3. update puppet-ceph to that it supports ACLs

- <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/509021/>

The above are WIPs under revision

It seems to be due to setting an overcloud domain. All things being equal, setting an overcloud domain causes the same error.   The ceph-mon processes are being started with an FQDN so /var/run/ceph/ceph-mon.overcloud-controller-2.asok does not exist, but /var/run/ceph/ceph-mon.overcloud-controller-2.my.domain.asok does.  Without setting an overcloud domain, the short hostname version of the file is there and ceph-ansible is happy.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c5)  Giulio Fidente    2017-10-31 18:52:51 UTC  ``` hi David, thanks for your help.  I wonder if passing mon_use_fqdn to ceph-ansible helps; could you try creating an heat environment file with the following contents:  parameter_defaults:   CephAnsibleExtraConfig:     mon_use_fqdn: true  and deploy the overcloud with the above to see if it passes?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c6)  David Critch    2017-11-01 03:05:12 UTC  ``` Yup, that totally did it.

I am trying to figure if we can enable the parameter in [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c5) conditionally when a cloud domain is set.  Can you tell me which parameters you use to set the cloud domain? Is it CloudDomain only?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c9)  David Critch    2017-11-01 13:09:48 UTC  ``` No. With OSP12, you can set an 'overcloud_domain_name' in undercloud.conf.  I had CloudDomain in one of my env files - along w/ doing the nova/neutron changes and restarts - prior to 12 but I took it out since undercloud.conf now covers all that.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c10)  Artem Hrechanychenko    2017-11-01 13:16:54 UTC  ``` w/a with [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c5](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c5 "CLOSED ERRATA - Deployment with ceph and TLS everywhere fails with: \"WorkflowTasks_Step2_Execution: ERROR \"cannot stat '/var/run/ceph/ceph-mon.overcloud-controller-2.asok': No such file or directory\"\"") works for me   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c11)  David Critch    2017-11-01 21:23:12 UTC  ``` FWIW, I tried `mon_use_fqdn: true` on a fresh deploy without setting the domain and that failed for the same reason. Would have been sweet you could just set it and not worry about it.  Whether you've configured a domain the old or the new way, the net result will include a dhcp_domain entry in nova.conf and a dns_domain entry in neutron.conf.

I suppose that is because nova is deliberately using .novalocal when the setting is left to the default.  I suppose a better fix would have been to set it to '' instead, as we do for the overcloud [1], what do you think?  1. <https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/blob/107b610923ba5d39f90c3a6a63bf2d3642e1b35d/puppet/services/nova-base.yaml#L223>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c33)  Yogev Rabl    2018-03-16 15:04:16 UTC  ``` failed to deploy the overcloud with the error:  "Error: /Stage[main]/Tripleo::Certmonger::Ca::Crl/File[tripleo-ca-crl]: Could not evaluate: Could not retrieve file metadata for <http://ipa-ca/ipa/crl/MasterCRL.bin>: getaddrinfo: Name or service not known"  which is documented in the bug: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554444](show_bug.cgi?id=1554444 "CLOSED ERRATA - OSP13 Deployment with TLS everywhere fails - Compute nodes request neutron cert and fail")  once that bug will backported I'll be able to verify this one   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c34)  Giulio Fidente    2018-03-19 18:58:09 UTC  ``` I am the assignee so I am not sure if I can move the BZ into VERIFIED myself but I tested this with:  ceph-ansible-3.0.27-1.el7cp.noarch  using a custom domain name (example.com) in neutron.conf and the following heat parameters:    CloudDomain: example.com   CloudName: overcloud.example.com   CloudNameInternal: overcloud.internalapi.example.com   CloudNameStorage: overcloud.storage.example.com   CloudNameStorageManagement: overcloud.storagemgmt.example.com   CloudNameCtlplane: overcloud.ctlplane.example.com   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c36)  Yogev Rabl    2018-03-23 19:35:32 UTC  ``` verified on openstack-tripleo-heat-templates-7.0.9-8.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=1507888#c39)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-03-28 17:14:53 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1593)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying and monitoring a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource-permission flaw was found in the python-tripleo and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates packages where ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume.

To exploit this flaw, the attacker must have local access to an overcloud node. However by default, access to overcloud nodes is restricted and accessible only from the management undercloud server on an internal network. (CVE-2017-12155)

This issue was discovered by Katuya Kawakami (NEC).

* It was discovered that the memcached connections using UDP transport protocol can be abused for efficient traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A remote attacker could send a malicious UDP request using a spoofed source IP address of a target system to memcached, causing it to send a significantly larger response to the target. (CVE-2018-1000115)

This advisory also addresses the following issues:

* This release adds support for deploying Dell EMC VMAX Block Storage backend using the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director. (BZ#1503896)
* Using composable roles for deploying Dell SC and PS Block Storage backend caused errors. The backends could only be deploying using 'cinder::config::cinder\_config' hiera data.

With this update, the composable role support for deploying the Dell SC and PS Block Storage backends is updated. As a result, they can be now deployed using composable roles. (BZ#1552980)

* Previously, the iptables rules were managed by the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director and the OpenStack Networking service, which resulted in the rules created by the OpenStack Networking service to persist on to the disk. As a result, the rules that should not be loaded after an iptables restart or a system reboot would be loaded causing traffic issues.

With this update, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director has been updated to exclude the OpenStack Networking rules from '/etc/sysconfig/iptables' when the director saves the firewall rules. As a result, iptables restart or a system reboot should work without causing traffic problems.
Note: It might be necessary to perform a rolling restart of the controller nodes to ensure that any orphaned managed neutron rules are no longer reloaded. (BZ#1541528)

* OS::TripleO::SwiftStorage::Ports\* resources have been renamed to OS::TripleO::ObjectStorage::Port\* to ensure standalone Object Storage nodes using the 'ObjectStorage' roles can be deployed correctly. Operators need to modify their custom templates that previously used OS::TripleO::SwiftStorage::Ports\* settings. (BZ#1544802)

It says that there is no value for it in any Heira data file and that no default is specified. This causes the deployment of the controller nodes to fail. See the attached output of "openstack stack failures list overcloud" for more details.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openstack-tripleo-heat-templates-5.3.10-1.el7ost.noarch puppet-manila-9.5.0-3.el7ost.noarch  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Using Infrared, deploy the candidate for OSP-10z8 specifying to setup and configure Manila with the Netapp cDOT Manila Driver 2. Observe that the overcloud deployment fails with the errors specified above when setting up the controller nodes.  Actual results: Overcloud deployment fails because the controller node deployment fails due to the manila::backend::cephfsnative::cephfs_auth_id variable not having a value either specified in any Heira file or set by default.   Expected results: Overcloud deployment shall be successful and the Manila NetApp cDOT Driver shall be setup and configured correctly.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1576577#c1)  Tom Barron    2018-05-10 13:07:00 UTC  ``` May be a side effect of the fix for [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462657](show_bug.cgi?id=1462657)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1576577#c8)  Vince Green    2018-05-15 15:26:37 UTC  ``` 13:53:49 ok: [undercloud-0] => {} 13:53:49 MSG: 13:53:49 Build mark: core_puddle=2018-05-14.3 15:15:31 PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************* 15:15:31 compute-0                  : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    15:15:31 controller-0               : ok=10   changed=6    unreachable=0    failed=0    15:15:31 controller-1               : ok=10   changed=6    unreachable=0    failed=0    15:15:31 controller-2               : ok=10   changed=6    unreachable=0    failed=0    15:15:31 hypervisor                 : ok=2    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    15:15:31 localhost                  : ok=2    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    15:15:31 undercloud-0               : ok=26   changed=11   unreachable=0    failed=0     <https://rhos-qe-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/job/OSPD-Customized-Deployment-virt/4230/>  Did a deployment on OSP10 with 2018-05-14.3 puddle and it deployed successfully without the original bug issue, marking bug as VERIFIED.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1576577#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-05-17 15:42:06 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1627)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying
and monitoring a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud
based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource-permission flaw was found in the python-tripleo and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates packages where ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume.

To exploit this flaw, the attacker must have local access to an overcloud node. However by default, access to overcloud nodes is restricted and accessible only from the management undercloud server on an internal network. (CVE-2017-12155)

This issue was discovered by Katuya Kawakami (NEC).

* It was discovered that the memcached connections using UDP transport protocol can be abused for efficient traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A remote attacker could send a malicious UDP request using a spoofed source IP address of a target system to memcached, causing it to send a significantly larger response to the target. (CVE-2018-1000115)

This update also includes the following bug fixes and enhancements:

* Prior to this update, when removing the ceph-osd RPM from overcloud nodes that do not require the package, the corresponding Ceph OSD product key was not removed. Consequently, the subscription-manager would incorrectly report that the Ceph OSD product was still installed.

With this update, the script that handles removal of the ceph-osd RPM now also removes the Ceph OSD product key. Note: The script that removes the RPM and product key executes only during the overcloud update procedure; the product key is removed only when the overcloud node is updated.
As a result, after removing the ceph-osd RPM, the subscription-manager no longer reports the Ceph OSD product is installed. (BZ#1571436)

* Previously, there were errors in the director Heat template that configures the VMAX Cinder backend driver. Consequently, the VMAX driver would not function correctly. With this update, the errors have been corrected, and the VMAX driver functions correctly. (BZ#1546799)
* This enhancement adds director support for deploying the Dell EMC VMAX cinder backend. (BZ#1546793)
* In this enhancement, if a minor update is blocked by an existing yum process that prevents the package update, the process should exit with an appropriate error message. This was added because the minor update may appear to freeze, due to yum waiting for the existing yum.pid to exit; when it eventually fails it is not immediately clear why. As a result, if there is an existing yum process preventing the package update, then the minor update fails with a clear message to indicate this: "ERROR existing yum.pid detected - can't continue! Please ensure there is no other package update process for the duration of the minor update worfklow. Exiting". (BZ#1471721)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-tripleo-common and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0602)

## Topic

An update for openstack-tripleo-common and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0 (Pike).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

openstack-tripleo-common contains the python library for code common to the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director CLI and GUI (codename tripleo).

openstack-tripleo-heat-templates is a collection of OpenStack Orchestration templates and tools (codename heat), which can be used to help deploy OpenStack.

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-tripleo-heat-templates: Ceph client keyring is world-readable when deployed by director (CVE-2017-12155)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Katuya Kawakami (NEC) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* All Compute and Controller nodes have bridge-mappings configured and therefore are eligible to schedule routers. However, if you scheduled a router on a Compute node that doesn't have a connection to an external network, connectivity with the external network fails. This fix adds the ability to configure bridge-mappings in TripleO and in the director according to roles so that you can now exclude Compute nodes from router scheduling and maintain external network connectivity. (BZ#1510879)
* Previously, the CephPools parameter value was incorrectly consumed as a string list instead of as a JSON object. This prevented creating additional Ceph pools during the overcloud deployment, because attempting to pass a JSON object failed. This fix updates the CephPools parameter so that it now accepts any JSON object that describes additional pools to create in the Ceph cluster. Note: The JSON object structure must conform to ceph-ansible conventions. (BZ#1516389)
* There is currently a known issue with LDAP integration for Red Hat OpenStack Platform. The `keystone\_domain\_confg` tag is missing currently from `keystone.yaml`, preventing Puppet from properly applying the required configuration files. Consequently, LDAP integration with Red Hat OpenStack Platform will not be properly configured. As a workaround, you must manually edit `keystone.yaml` and add the missing tag. There are two ways to do this:

1. Edit the file directly:
 a. Log into the undercloud as the stack user.
 b. Open the keystone.yaml in the editor of your choice. For example:
 `sudo vi /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/docker/services/keystone.yaml`
 c. Append the missing puppet tag, `keystone\_domain\_confg`, to line 94. For example:
 `puppet\_tags: keystone\_config`
 Changes to:
 `puppet\_tags: keystone\_config,keystone\_domain\_confg`
 d. Save and close `keystone.yaml`.
 e. Verify you see the missing tag in the `keystone.yaml` file. The following command should return '1':
 `cat /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/docker/sercies/keystone.yaml | grep 'puppet\_tags: keystone\_config,keystone\_domain\_config' | wc -l`

2. Or, use sed to edit the file inline:
 a. Login to the undercloud as the stack user.
 b. Run the following command to add the missing puppet tag:
 `sed -i 's/puppet\_tags\: keystone\_config/puppet\_tags\: keystone\_config,keystone\_domain\_config/' /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/docker/services/keystone.yaml`
 c. Verify you see the missing tag in the keystone.yaml file The following command should return '1':
 `cat /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/docker/sercies/keystone.yaml | grep 'puppet\_tags: keystone\_config,keystone\_domain\_config' | wc -l` (BZ#1519057)

* It is only possible to deploy Ceph storage servers if their disk devices are homogeneous. (BZ#1520004)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Deploy OSP11 with split stack on pre-provisioned nodes 2. Reboot one of the nodes 3.
