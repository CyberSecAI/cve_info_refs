  "CVE-2017-12155": {
    "description": "A resource-permission flaw was found in the openstack-tripleo-heat-templates package where ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume.",
    "root_cause": "The ceph.client.openstack.keyring file is created with world-readable permissions during deployment.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure file permissions",
      "World-readable keyring file"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can access the Ceph cluster as the 'client.openstack' user, allowing them to read or modify data in Ceph pools.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to overcloud nodes"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user access to overcloud nodes."
