Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-12218

**Root Cause:** A vulnerability exists in the malware detection functionality within Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESAs). This vulnerability is related to how the ESA handles malformed EML attachments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue lies in the inadequate handling of malformed EML attachments by the AMP engine. This allows the attacker to bypass the malware scanning mechanism. Specifically, a corrupted EML attachment is not properly scanned.

**Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an unauthenticated remote attacker can deliver email attachments containing malware to end users, which would otherwise be blocked. This could result in malware infections and compromise of end-user systems.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, using specially crafted email attachments with corrupted EML formatting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a target that uses a vulnerable Cisco ESA.
    * The attacker needs to craft a malicious EML attachment that is designed to bypass the ESA's malware scanning.
    * No authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESAs that are configured with message or content filters to scan incoming email attachments.
*   A workaround involves configuring multiple levels of email attachment scanning to ensure a corrupted EML attachment is scanned by multiple packages within the ESA.
* The issue was discovered during resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
* The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.8.
* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)
