Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-12432:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory exhaustion issue in the `ReadPCXImage` function of ImageMagick when processing PCX image files.
- The vulnerability is caused by the way memory is allocated to store image data, which is calculated based on values read from the input image file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The size of the allocated memory is directly influenced by the `pcx_packets` variable which in turn is based on the `pcx_info.planes` value read directly from the PCX file.
- **Missing Input Sanitization:** The `pcx_info.planes` value is read directly from the input file without validation.
- **Bypass Resource Limits:**  The configured memory limits (e.g., in `policy.xml`) can be bypassed because the memory allocation happens before the resource policy is checked or enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can create a specially crafted PCX image file with a very large `pcx_info.planes` value, causing the program to attempt to allocate a massive amount of memory. This can lead to memory exhaustion and crash the process, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Memory Exhaustion**: The program will attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to a crash, potentially destabilizing the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted PCX image file.
- **File Processing:** An attacker needs to trick a user or system into processing the malicious PCX file using ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create/Modify Files:**  An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a PCX image file.
- **Target Interaction:** An attacker needs a target (user/system) to process this crafted image file.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `ReadPCXImage` function.
- The following lines of code are vulnerable:
  ```c
  pcx_packets=(size_t) image->rows*pcx_info.bytes_per_line; //397
  ...
  pcx_packets=(size_t) pcx_packets*pcx_info.planes; //400
  pixel_info=AcquireVirtualMemory(pcx_packets,2*sizeof(*pixels)); //406
  ```
- `pcx_info.planes` is read directly from the file:
  `pcx_info.planes=(unsigned char) ReadBlobByte(image); //358`
