The content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in several PHP files. Specifically, the `$table_name` and `$table_fields` variables are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `AJAX_lookup_handler.php`, `AJAX_check_id.php`, and `AJAX_vocabolary_control.php`.
- Improper use of `escape_string` which only escapes specific characters (`'`, `"`, `\`) but does not prevent SQL injection when the input contains other special characters or commands.
- Lack of sanitization for `$table_fields` variable before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Attackers can bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges.
- Full database takeover is possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests to `AJAX_lookup_handler.php`, `AJAX_check_id.php`, and `AJAX_vocabolary_control.php`.
- Manipulating the `tableName` and `tableFields` POST parameters with crafted SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires a user with librarian role which has access to the vulnerable URLs.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the application.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax.
