Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-12251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from weaknesses in how the web console of the Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100 generates certain authentication mechanisms within the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Authentication Mechanism Generation:** The core issue is that the authentication controls within the URL of the web console are weak. The specific patterns within the URL that govern the web application's authentication are predictable or manipulable.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** This ultimately leads to the ability to bypass authentication controls and interact with services or virtual machines (VMs) without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to specific VMs hosted on the CSP device.
*   **Complete Loss of CIA:** The impact of this unauthorized access can lead to a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system. This implies the attacker can view sensitive data, modify system configurations, and disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via network access.
*   **Web Console Interaction:**  The attack vector involves browsing to a hosted VM's URL on the Cisco CSP through the web console.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker exploits weaknesses by viewing specific patterns in the URL that control authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have already authenticated to the web console of the Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100. This means they have initial access to the management interface.
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted CSP device.
*   **Knowledge of URL Patterns:** The attacker needs to identify and understand the specific patterns within the URL that control authentication.
*   **Malicious Intent:** The attacker leverages this knowledge to interact maliciously with the services and VMs running on the affected device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100 running software releases 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, or 2.2.2.
*   The issue was reported by Chris Day from MWR InfoSecurity.
*   The fix is available in Cisco Cloud Services Platform Release 2.2.3 or later.
*   There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
