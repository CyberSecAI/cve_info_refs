Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-12836:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way CVS (Concurrent Versions System) handles SSH for remote repositories. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate the hostname provided in a repository URL when using SSH. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SSH options through a specially crafted hostname.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By embedding malicious SSH options, such as `-oProxyCommand=`, into the hostname part of a CVS repository URL, an attacker can force the `ssh` command to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation for the hostname field when using SSH with CVS. The application does not check or sanitize this input before passing it to the `ssh` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the `cvs` command.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** If the user running `cvs` has elevated privileges, the attacker's code would also execute with those privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including malware installation, data theft, and system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Repository URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious CVS repository URL that includes the command injection payload in the hostname.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing the malicious repository using `cvs`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, without direct access to the victim's machine.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to persuade the victim to use the malicious repository URL. This could be done via email, messaging, or by hosting the malicious repository on a website, etc.

**Technical Details:**

*   When CVS is configured to use SSH (e.g., `CVS_RSH=ssh`), the hostname in the repository URL is passed to the `ssh` command.
*   By including `-oProxyCommand=...` in the hostname, the attacker can execute commands through `ssh`.
*   The `cvs` client program will execute the `ssh` command and subsequently the attacker-provided code.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was fixed by properly sanitizing the input to the `ssh` command. This typically involved using the `--` separator which prevents `ssh` from interpreting arguments as options instead of the target host.
