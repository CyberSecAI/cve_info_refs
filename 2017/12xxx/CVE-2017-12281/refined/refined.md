- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in the implementation of Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) functionality for standalone configurations of Cisco Aironet 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass MAC authentication. Specifically, the flaw is in the handling of MAC address filtering within the PEAP implementation when used with FlexConnect local switching and central authentication settings. This is tracked as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and connect to the affected access point. While the advisory states "Confidentiality Impact: None" and "Integrity Impact: None," the "Availability Impact" is High, which means that an attacker could potentially cause disruption of service. 
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker must be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable access point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be in a position to communicate on the local network with the vulnerable Cisco Aironet access point and must be able to initiate the exploitation without any prior authentication to the device. The attacker needs no user interaction. The attack complexity is considered to be high, but the attacker requires no privileges on the target device.
