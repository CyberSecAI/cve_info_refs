Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12863:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflows in the `PxMDecoder::readData` function within the OpenCV library during image decoding. Specifically, calculations involving `m_width`, `m_bpp`, `bit_depth`, and `nch` can overflow, leading to incorrect memory allocation sizes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the potential for integer overflows during calculations within the `PxMDecoder::readData` function, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** Due to the integer overflow, an incorrect amount of memory is allocated, which leads to heap-based buffer overflow when writing data into the buffer using `icvCvt_BGR2RGB_8u_C3R`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The identified vulnerabilities can lead to a denial-of-service condition, indicated by the crash logs, where the application terminates due to memory corruption.
*  **Memory corruption**: The vulnerabilities could lead to memory corruption. The gentoo advisory indicates that this could enable other memory corruption attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector involves processing a specially crafted PXM image file. This file is designed to trigger the integer overflow in the `PxMDecoder::readData` function when processed by OpenCV's image loading functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious PXM file:** The attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted PXM image to a system that utilizes the vulnerable OpenCV library, typically via a website or software which loads user-submitted images using the vulnerable library.

**Additional details:**

*   The github issue report provides a detailed code location where the overflow happens.
*   The github issue also provides a sample poc to trigger the vulnerability.
* The debian security update lists the vulnerability along with other opencv vulnerabilities that were fixed in the same update.
* The Gentoo security advisory also lists this vulnerability along with other opencv vulnerabilities and specifies that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
