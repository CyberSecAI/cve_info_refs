The provided content is a bug report for binutils, specifically addressing multiple undefined behaviors and crashes (Bug 21813). The report details several vulnerabilities found when parsing corrupt binary files. Although the report covers multiple issues, the issues can be summarized as follows:

**Root Causes of Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** Several issues stem from a lack of proper validation on input data when parsing binary files. This includes insufficient size checks before reading records, invalid section index checks, missing checks for truncated or empty strings when concatenating symbol names, and missing sanity checks.
- **Incorrect Logic:** Some errors result from incorrect assumptions, such as when handling relocations in mach-o binaries where the base address was not being passed, leading to incorrect processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:** One issue mentioned is a heap overflow within `vms-alpha.c` where insufficient checks were made before reading the remaining part of a record, when processing corrupt VMS binaries.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The report describes out-of-bounds reads in multiple files when parsing corrupted mach-o and vms files.
- **Address Violation Errors:** The report details address violation errors due to missing size checks and other input validation issues.
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The issue in rddbg.c, where concatenation of symbol names was performed without checking for empty strings, would lead to null pointer dereference.
- **Buffer Overflow:** A stack buffer overflow was detected in prdbg.c functions during printing of debug information, due to insufficient buffer sizes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Crashes can occur when parsing specially crafted or corrupt binary files, leading to a denial of service.
- **Undefined Behavior:** Various issues, such as reading beyond the boundary of buffers can lead to undefined behavior, potentially leading to further issues or exploitable conditions.
- **Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly mentioned, out-of-bounds reads could potentially leak memory contents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Binary File:** By providing a specially crafted or corrupted binary file as input to `objdump` or other affected binutils utilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local or Remote Access:** An attacker would need to be able to execute `objdump` or other tools from binutils with a malicious binary file.

**Additional Details:**
- The report includes test cases and ASAN output that show how to trigger the vulnerabilities.
- The identified issues affect multiple parts of the binutils project, particularly the modules for processing mach-o and VMS binaries.
- The fixes involved adding checks and input validation to prevent further issues.
- Patches were backported to earlier versions of binutils.

**Relevance to CVE-2017-12456:**

Based on the provided text, **it is impossible to definitively link this content to CVE-2017-12456.** The bug report describes several vulnerabilities resolved within the binutils project, but the provided description of CVE-2017-12456 is a placeholder. Without an official description of CVE-2017-12456, it's not possible to say whether these vulnerabilities are related. However, the types of vulnerabilities described in the bug report (heap overflow, out-of-bounds reads, address violation) are often found in CVEs related to binary parsing libraries like binutils.

**Conclusion:**
The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities within binutils, stemming from insufficient input validation and incorrect logic while processing binary files. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include crashes, undefined behavior, and potentially information disclosure. The attack vector is providing a specially crafted malicious binary file. The report includes information about the root cause of the vulnerabilities, the vulnerable code sections, and the resolutions.
