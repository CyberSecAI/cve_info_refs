# Shadow: Buffer overflow — GLSA **201710-16**

A vulnerability found in Shadow may allow remote attackers to cause
a Denial of Service condition or produce other unspecified behaviors.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-apps/shadow** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.5** |

### Background

Shadow is a set of tools to deal with user accounts.

### Description

Malformed input in the newusers tool may produce crashes and other
unspecified behaviors.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition or
bypass privilege boundaries in some web-hosting environments in which a
Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Shadow users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/shadow-4.5"

```

 I can confirm the bug on jessie.

newusers file

works correctly if file contains just one line, but it fails when it
has multiple entries

*** Error in `newusers': free(): invalid next size (fast): 0xf95b5ed8 ***
Aborted

The bug is know also here

Date: Tue, 21 Jun 2016 11:42:25 +0200
```
Hi,

I can confirm this bug. Using a file with 5 new users I get the
following error:

# newusers 5users.csv
*** Error in `newusers': double free or corruption (!prev): 0x0000000001ae2d10 ***
Aborted

A curious detail: if the first 4 users are already created and I run
newusers, the 5th one is added without problems. If I have 6 users in
the file and the first 5 users are already created the 6th one is added
without problems. And so on.

$ dpkg -s passwd | grep 'Version'
Version: 1:4.2-3.1

```

Could you run that in gdb and show the backtrace here?  It smells like
a bad realloc.

Hello; even though this doesn't directly allow crossing security
boundaries I thought it best to make this visible in case management
tools may have their boundaries crossed due to this.

Use [CVE-2017-12424](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12424).

Thanks

If ptr->line == NULL for an entry, the first cycle will exit,
but the second one will happily write past entries buffer.
We actually do not want to exit the first cycle prematurely
on ptr->line == NULL.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Description

In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts.

# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

Package        : shadow
Version        : 1:4.4-4.1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-12424 CVE-2017-20002
Debian Bug     : 756630 914957

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the shadow suite of login
tools. An attacker may escalate privileges in specific configurations.

CVE-2017-20002

    Shadow incorrectly lists pts/0 and pts/1 as physical terminals in
    /etc/securetty. This allows local users to login as password-less
    users even if they are connected by non-physical means such as SSH
    (hence bypassing PAM's nullok_secure configuration). This notably
    affects environments such as virtual machines automatically
    generated with a default blank root password, allowing all local
    users to escalate privileges. It should be noted however that
    /etc/securetty will be dropped in Debian 11/bullseye.

CVE-2017-12424

    The newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data
    structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input may
    lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory
    corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a
    privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting
    environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user
    account to create subaccounts.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:4.4-4.1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your shadow packages.

For the detailed security status of shadow please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/shadow>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

I have the same problem. First, I did a small test with few users (about 2 to update and one to added) and it worked, but when I would like to push all the list of my job users (20 lines with 5 first one already registered), I have this error.

When add 2 new users, it works. If more, it return this error.

Perhaps It is important to note that samba is installed and ...

"no talloc stackframe at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory" is returned too... an other bug reported too !
