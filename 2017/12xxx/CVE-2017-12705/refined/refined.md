- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Advantech WebOP product. This can be triggered by a maliciously crafted project file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a device crash and potentially allow arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves using a maliciously crafted project file, which is likely loaded through a local or otherwise non-networked method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to load a crafted project file onto the target device. The attack requires low skill level.
