  "CVE-2017-12188": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The Linux kernel built with the KVM visualization support (CONFIG_KVM), with nested visualization(nVMX) feature enabled (nested=1), was vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow issue. The vulnerability could occur while traversing guest page table entries to resolve guest virtual address(gva). An L1 guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in denial of service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host to gain privileges on the system.",
    "vulnerability": "Stack buffer overflow in KVM MMU during page walks.",
    "impact": "Denial of service or potential arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
    "attack_vector": "Exploitation through a malicious L1 guest.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control a virtual machine running on the vulnerable hypervisor."
