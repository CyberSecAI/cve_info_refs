The provided content from exploit-db.com describes a SQL injection vulnerability in iTech Caregiver Script version 2.71.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple parameters when querying the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in several parameters within the `searchSitter.php` and `searchJob.php` files. Specifically, the `myCity`, `sitterService`, `age`, `gender`, `lastLoginElapsedInDays`, `yearsOfExperience`, `collegeLevel`, `fullPartTime`, `liveInOut` parameters in `searchSitter.php` and `sitterService`, `jobType`, and `jobFrequency` in `searchJob.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, allowing them to potentially read sensitive data, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server. The exploit-db entry demonstrates this by retrieving database schema information.

**Attack vectors:**
HTTP GET requests to `searchSitter.php` or `searchJob.php` with malicious SQL code in the URL parameters mentioned above.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of SQL injection techniques. No authentication is needed, since the vulnerability is present in public facing search pages.
