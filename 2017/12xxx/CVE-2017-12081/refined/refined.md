Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-12081

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `vcol_to_fcol` function when upgrading legacy mesh attributes in Blender.

**Vulnerability/Weakness:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates the size of a new array by multiplying `me->totface` (total number of faces) by the size of each entry (4 integers). A large `totface` value can lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller than expected memory allocation.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The loop that populates the array proceeds to write data based on the original, potentially very large `totface` value which overflows the undersized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap-based buffer overflow can allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the Blender application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious .blend File:** An attacker can craft a malicious .blend file containing a mesh with a large `totface` value to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious .blend file or use it as a library, in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to create a specially crafted `.blend` file.
*   Ability to get the target user to open the crafted file using a vulnerable version of Blender.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `vcol_to_fcol` function called during the loading of legacy `.blend` files (`source/blender/blenloader/intern/versioning_legacy.c`).
*   The code allocates memory for `mcolmain` based on `me->totface` without proper overflow checks.
*   The loop iterates over `me->totface`, writing data to the undersized `mcolmain` buffer, causing a heap overflow.

**Affected versions:**
*   Blender v2.78c is specifically mentioned as vulnerable.
*   The Debian security advisories indicate that versions prior to 2.72.b+dfsg0-3+deb8u1 (for Debian 8 "Jessie") and 2.79.b+dfsg0-1~deb9u1 (for Debian 9 "Stretch") are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) script is mentioned which generates a malicious `.blend` file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The provided crash information shows the initial state of allocation and the state after the overflow.
