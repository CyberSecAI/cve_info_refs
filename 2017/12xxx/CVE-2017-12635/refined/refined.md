{
  "CVE-2017-12635": {
    "Root cause": "The JSON parser in Apache CouchDB processes 'roles' keys in a way that allows a non-admin user to grant themselves admin privileges.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect parsing of JSON data",
      "Authorization bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "A non-admin user can escalate their privileges to become an administrator.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests to the CouchDB API",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Access to the CouchDB API, ability to create a user account"
  },
   "CVE-2017-12636":{
    "Root cause": "CouchDB allows configuration of paths to operating system-level binaries which are then launched by CouchDB. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands by manipulating configuration options.",
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary command execution",
        "Insecure configuration options"
    ],
    "Impact":"Arbitrary command execution as the CouchDB user, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors":"HTTP requests to the CouchDB API to configure the database server",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Administrative access to the CouchDB API"
   }
