# Stored XSS in lib/functions.php:1519 #918

## Description

[![@scarvell](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268862?u=351efdcc54bd421299810cc74ec0f773f014de4b&v=4&size=48)](/scarvell)[scarvell](https://github.com/scarvell)opened [on Aug 19, 2017](https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/issues/918#issue-251417519)

Lower risk, given that an account requires access to be able to add/edit external links to store the XSS, but line 1519 of lib/html.php isn't sanitizing `$tab['title']`.

```
print "<li><a id='" . (isset($tab['id']) ? $tab['id'] : 'maintab-anchor-' . $i) . "' class='lefttab" .(isset($tab['selected']) ? ' selected':'') . "' href='" . $tab['url'] . "'>" . $tab['title'] . "</a></li>\n";

```

Although the `title` field in external\_links is a varchar(20), we can get around that restriction by creating multiple tabs and using comment blocks to keep the XSS valid:

Create the first tab with title:

`<script>alert(1)/*`

Create second tab with title:

`*/</script>`
