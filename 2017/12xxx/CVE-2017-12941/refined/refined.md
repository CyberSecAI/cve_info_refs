      "source": "security.gentoo.org_176dc221_20250124_232620.html",
      "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in RAR and UnRAR. A remote attacker, by enticing a user to open a specially crafted RAR, could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition."

      "details": "Directory traversal and memory safety bugs were found in UnRAR 5.5.6. These bugs have been fixed in UnRAR 5.5.7. \n\n* Directory traversal: UnRAR's directory traversal protections can be bypassed by using symlinks in a crafted archive.\n\n* Out-of-bounds read in Archive::ReadHeader15 / EncodeFileName::Decode: If NameSize is bigger than NM*4, EncodeFileName::Decode can read past the bounds of the FileName array.\n\n* Out-of-bounds reads in Unpack::Unpack20: A crafted archive can cause an out-of-bounds read due to a large DistNumber.\n\n* Buffer overflow in Unpack::LongLZ: A crafted archive can cause a buffer overflow due to a large DistancePlace."

  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities including directory traversal, out-of-bounds reads, and buffer overflows due to insufficient input validation and boundary checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal",
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Buffer overflow"
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process, Denial of Service, and potentially gaining access to files outside the intended extraction directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted RAR archives, utilizing symlinks for directory traversal and malformed data to trigger memory safety bugs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted RAR archive."
