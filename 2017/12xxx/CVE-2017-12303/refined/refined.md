Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) file filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA). Specifically, the issue lies in how the software handles zipped or archived file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is an inadequate or flawed implementation within the AMP file filtering mechanism, specifically concerning archive file types. This allows attackers to bypass configured AMP file filtering rules.
- CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Security Controls:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to circumvent configured AMP file filtering rules, meaning malicious archived files can pass through the WSA undetected.
- **Compromised Integrity:** While the vulnerability doesn't directly affect confidentiality or availability, it does impact integrity by allowing potentially malicious content through the security appliance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network, without any need for local access or physical access.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to carry out the attack, indicating a public-facing vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a vulnerable WSA device.
- **No Specific Privileges:** The attacker does not need to have any existing privileges or credentials to perform the attack.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs some knowledge of this vulnerability.
