The provided content relates to CVE-2017-12956.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An illegal address access occurs in the `Exiv2::FileIo::path[abi:cxx11]()` function of the exiv2 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `path()` method of a `FileIo` object is accessed.
- It leads to a crash due to a memory corruption issue (`malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a crash of the exiv2 application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted input file (`POC12` or a similar file) to the exiv2 tool.
- The exiv2 tool processes the crafted file, eventually calling the vulnerable `Exiv2::FileIo::path[abi:cxx11]()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted input file to the exiv2 tool.
- No special privileges are mentioned, so likely the attacker needs to execute the vulnerable exiv2 binary with the malicious input.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report mentions a related bug ([bug 1482423](show_bug.cgi?id=1482423)) and that the initial PoC provided was duplicated with that bug's PoC.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `exiv2-0.27.0-1.el7_6`.
- The issue is related to how exiv2 handles file paths, specifically when a certain internal structure of file information is processed during metadata extraction.
- The backtrace shows that the crash occurs during memory allocation within the standard C++ library while constructing a string representing the file path. This suggests a potential memory corruption leading to inconsistent data structures for memory allocation.
