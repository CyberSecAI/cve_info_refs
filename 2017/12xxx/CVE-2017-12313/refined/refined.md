Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-12313

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to an untrusted search path in the Cisco Network Academy Packet Tracer software. This means that the software, when executed, searches for required DLL files in locations that an attacker can control, instead of relying on specific, secure directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **DLL Hijacking/Preloading (CWE-427):** The software is susceptible to DLL hijacking because it does not properly validate the location of loaded DLLs. An attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate one in the current working directory. When the installer is executed from this directory, the malicious DLL will be loaded instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a user with administrative privileges executes the installer, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's system. The malicious DLL can contain any executable code, allowing the attacker to perform actions like installing malware, creating new accounts, or modifying system settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the targeted system. This means they must be able to log in to the system or have some form of local access, such as through a previously compromised account or system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the local user to execute the installer from the current working directory where the malicious DLL is placed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a way to write files to a location on the target system. This could be achieved by having a local user account or through some other means of file access.
*   **Ability to create/place a malicious DLL:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious DLL file and place it in the same directory where the user will execute the installer.
*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to lure an administrative user to execute the installer in the directory with the crafted malicious DLL to gain arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered a medium severity with a CVSS base score of 4.2
*   There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Kushal Arvind Shah of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs.
