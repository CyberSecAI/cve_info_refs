Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of explicit checks on the validity of EC (Elliptic Curve) public keys within the `Nimbus-JOSE-JWT` library. Specifically, the library did not verify if the provided x and y coordinates of an EC public key actually lie on the expected elliptic curve.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper validation of EC public key components against the defined curve. This allows for the possibility of using invalid public keys.
- **Reliance on Underlying Provider:** The code was implicitly relying on the underlying SUN provider to throw a `RuntimeException` if an invalid curve was used. This is not a reliable way of validation and it can have different behaviours based on the environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary risk, as implied by the linked Kudelski Security article, is that an attacker could potentially craft invalid EC public keys that would either:
    - Cause unexpected errors or exceptions, leading to denial-of-service (DoS).
    - Bypass security checks, potentially leading to signature forgery or unauthorized access.
   The exact impact can vary depending on how the library is used and the downstream operations being performed with the manipulated key.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the `Nimbus-JOSE-JWT` library with a crafted EC public key. This would likely happen through a JWT which contains the manipulated key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position where they can influence the EC public key used by the `Nimbus-JOSE-JWT` library. This typically involves situations where the attacker can control the content of a JSON Web Key (JWK) or similar structure that is then used in the signature verification.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented was to add explicit checks within the `EC JWK constructor` to ensure the x and y coordinates actually lie on the expected curve.
- The issue was resolved with commit [f3a7a80](https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-jose-jwt/commits/f3a7a80).
- This issue was tracked as issue #217 in the `Nimbus-JOSE-JWT` project.
