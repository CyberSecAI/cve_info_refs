Root cause of vulnerability:
The `admin_peers` API in cpp-ethereum's JSON-RPC server lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to access functionality intended for administrator privileges.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper authorization: The `admin_peers` API does not check for user privileges before providing access to restricted functionality.
- Default binding to 0.0.0.0: The JSON-RPC interface is exposed to the world by default, making it accessible remotely.
- Lack of Content-Type enforcement: The 'application/json' Content-Type is not enforced, making the API vulnerable to CSRF or SSRF attacks.
- Inconsistency in API implementation: The `admin_net_peers` API includes an authorization check, while `admin_peers` does not, despite providing similar functionality.
- Lack of option to change interface binding: There is no visible option to change the default JSON-RPC interface to localhost.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can bypass authorization and access functionality reserved for administrators, potentially gaining information about the network and peers.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted JSON request to the `admin_peers` API.
- Exploiting the lack of Content-Type enforcement to perform CSRF or SSRF attacks.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must be able to send JSON requests to the JSON-RPC interface.
- No credentials or prior authentication is required.
- The attacker can be remote.
