Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12331:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient signature verification of software patches within Cisco NX-OS System Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Signature Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of robust signature verification when loading software patches, allowing the bypass of this security measure.
- **Insufficient Verification:** The system fails to properly validate the authenticity and integrity of software patches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to load a crafted, unsigned software patch. This effectively allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
- **Compromise of System Integrity:** By loading malicious patches, attackers can potentially gain control of the device, modify its behavior, exfiltrate sensitive data, disrupt network operations, or cause other forms of damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials to load software patches onto the system.
- **Local Presence:** The attacker must be present at the target device or have remote access capabilities which allow local actions (e.g. CLI).

**Affected Products:**
- Multilayer Director Switches
- Nexus 7000 Series Switches
- Nexus 7700 Series Switches
- Unified Computing System Manager
