Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the upgrade process of Cisco Spark Board. Specifically, the system fails to properly verify the signature of the upgrade package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Signature Verification Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper signature verification during the upgrade process. This allows an attacker to potentially install a malicious or unverified upgrade package.
*   **CWE-16 (Configuration)**: The advisory categorizes this vulnerability as CWE-16, indicating an issue related to security configuration. This may be due to the insufficient or missing verification steps within the upgrade procedure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Integrity Impact:** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a compromise of the system's integrity. An attacker could install an unverified, potentially malicious upgrade package, leading to a compromised system that operates outside of normal parameters.
*   **No confidentiality or availability impact**: The CVSS score indicates that the vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality or availability of the affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Cisco Spark Board device. This means the attacker must have physical access or be on the local network with sufficient privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated, Local User:** The attacker needs to be a locally authenticated user with sufficient privileges to initiate the upgrade process.
*   **Ability to provide a malicious upgrade package**: The attacker must have the capability to craft or obtain a malicious upgrade package that would bypass signature verification

**Summary of findings:**
The vulnerability allows a local, authenticated attacker to bypass signature verification during the upgrade process and install an unverified package on the Cisco Spark Board, leading to a compromise of system integrity.
