**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect permission assignment for critical resources (CWE-732).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple files and folders with Access Control Lists (ACLs) that affect other users are allowed to be modified by non-administrator accounts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a low-privileged user to modify critical files and folders, potentially leading to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access is required, as the attacker needs to be able to interact with the affected system and modify the file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have low-level privileges on the system. They do not require any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
