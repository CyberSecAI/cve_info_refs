The provided content relates to CVE-2017-12450 as it describes multiple vulnerabilities found in binutils, which is the subject of the CVE.

The following vulnerabilities were identified and fixed:

*   **Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in `vms-alpha.c`
    *   **Root cause:** When parsing VMS object files, the code did not properly check the record size before reading, leading to a heap overflow when a record size is larger than the input buffer.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when parsing VMS object files. Specifically, the code reads a record size from the file and then attempts to read that many bytes from the file without validating it against the file size.
    *   **Impact:** Heap-based buffer overflow, which can cause a crash or other undefined behavior.
    *   **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted, malformed VMS object file using `objdump`.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to provide a malicious file to `objdump`

*   **Vulnerability**: Address violation errors in `rddbg.c` and `mach-o.c`
    *   **Root cause:** When concatenating symbol names in `rddbg.c`, the code did not check for empty strings. `mach-o.c` had issues with canonicalizing relocations
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of handling for empty strings, and incorrect relocation processing.
    *   **Impact:** Memory access errors and potentially a crash when parsing specific debug information or Mach-O relocations.
    *    **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted, malformed binary file using `objdump`.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to provide a malicious file to `objdump`

* **Vulnerability**: Buffer overflow in `mach-o-arm.c`
    * **Root cause**: Sanity checks for PAIR relocations were not done in one branch of a conditional.
    * **Weakness**: Missing sanity check of relocations in a particular code branch.
    * **Impact**: Buffer overflow leading to crash or undefined behavior.
    * **Attack vector**: Processing a crafted, malformed Mach-O binary file using `objdump`
    * **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to provide a malicious file to `objdump`
