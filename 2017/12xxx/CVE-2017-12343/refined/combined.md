| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: |

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThese vulnerabilities affect all releases of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software prior to the first fixed release. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug IDs at the top of this advisory.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Five vulnerabilities in Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software could allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary values into DCNM configuration parameters, redirect a user to a malicious website, inject malicious content into a DCNM client interface, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software.  The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows. Cisco Data Center Network Manager Bypass Client-Side Validation Parameters Vulnerability A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary values into DCNM configuration parameters for an affected system.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of user-supplied data in HTTP payloads that are sent to the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by bypassing server-side protections and injecting arbitrary values into certain configuration parameters for the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary values into DCNM configuration parameters.  The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12343  The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium Cisco Data Center Network Manager HTTP Header Injection Vulnerability A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco DCNM Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user of the affected interface to a malicious, attacker-controlled website.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of values in HTTP header parameters that are sent to the web interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link and injecting malicious HTTP headers into HTTP messages that are sent to or from the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user of the affected software to a malicious, attacker-controlled website.  The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12344  The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium Cisco Data Center Network Manager Content Spoofing Vulnerability A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco DCNM Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject malicious content into the content that is displayed by the affected interface.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied values in HTTP parameters that are sent to the web interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP parameter values into HTTP messages that are sent to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject malicious content into the content that is displayed by the web interface of the affected software, which could allow the attacker to persuade a user to follow malicious instructions or click a malicious link.
