**CVE-2017-12784**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   A flaw when applying ACL changes requested from the CLI exposes the `novi_process_manager_daemon` network service.
    *   This network service has a command injection vulnerability and a stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Exposure of the `novi_process_manager_daemon` network service.
    *   Command injection vulnerability.
    *   Stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker gains privileged (root) code execution on the switch device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network access to TCP port 2020.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Unauthenticated remote attacker.

**CVE-2017-12785**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow and command injection in the CLI (`novish`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Buffer overflow.
    *   Command injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Authenticated, low-privileged user can break out of the CLI and execute commands as root.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Local access via the CLI by providing an overly long string to `show log cli username`.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Authenticated low-privileged user with CLI access.

**CVE-2017-12786**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   A flaw when applying ACL changes requested from the CLI could expose `noviengine` and `cliengine` network services.
    *   These network services have a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability when unpacking serialized values.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Exposure of `noviengine` and `cliengine` network services.
    *   Stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain privileged (root) code execution on the switch device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network access to TCP ports 9090 or 12345.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Unauthenticated remote attacker.
