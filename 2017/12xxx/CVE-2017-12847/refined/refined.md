{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Nagios daemon creates its PID file after dropping privileges, leading to a potential race condition where a non-root user can replace the PID file contents with a PID of a root-owned process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure PID file handling",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service against arbitrary root processes by sending signals to the replaced PID in the tampered PID file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "Ability to write to the PID file location"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A non-root user with write access to the directory where the PID file is stored is needed. The attacker also needs to know the path to the pid file. An init script that uses the PID file is also needed to exploit the vulnerability."
