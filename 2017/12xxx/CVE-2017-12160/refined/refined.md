{
  "CVE-2017-12160": {
    "Description": "It was found that Keycloak oauth would permit an authenticated resource to obtain an access/refresh token pair from the authentication server, permitting indefinite usage in the case of permission revocation. An attacker on an already compromised resource could use this flaw to grant himself continued permissions and possibly conduct further attacks.",
    "Root cause": "Keycloak oauth permits an authenticated resource to obtain an access/refresh token pair from the authentication server, allowing indefinite usage even after permission revocation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper token handling",
      "Lack of proper permission revocation enforcement"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with control of a compromised resource can gain continued permissions by obtaining an access/refresh token pair, leading to further attacks and potential privilege escalation.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Compromised resource"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to have already compromised a resource that is authenticated with Keycloak. They also need to be able to use the oauth to gain access to the access/refresh token pair."
