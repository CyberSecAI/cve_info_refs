Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the calculation of the allocation size for `bindinfluences` array within the `modifier_mdef_compact_influences` function of Blender.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow (CWE-190):** The product of `sizeof(MDefInfluence)` and `mmd->totinfluence` can result in an integer overflow when calculating the buffer size. This leads to the allocation of a heap buffer that is smaller than required.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** When populating the `bindinfluences` array, the code can write beyond the bounds of the undersized allocated buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The heap-based buffer overflow can overwrite heap metadata and potentially be leveraged to gain arbitrary code execution within the context of the Blender application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted .blend File:** An attacker can craft a .blend file containing a `MeshDeformModifierData` object with a crafted `totinfluence` value that will trigger the integer overflow during loading of the file.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious .blend file using Blender.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a .blend file.
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the function `modifier_mdef_compact_influences`.
*   It occurs when loading old `bindcos` structures into the new format.
*   The vulnerable code multiplies the `totinfluence` field from the file with the size of a `MDefInfluence` object to determine the allocation size for `bindinfluences`.
*   A crafted `totinfluence` value can lead to an integer overflow during this multiplication, resulting in a smaller buffer being allocated.
*   The application then attempts to fill the undersized buffer, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   The provided Talos report also includes a proof-of-concept generator to create a vulnerable .blend file and demonstrates that the crash occurs during the writing beyond the allocated buffer.
*   The issue was fixed in Blender version 2.79.b+dfsg0-1~deb9u1 (Debian stable/stretch) and 2.72.b+dfsg0-3+deb8u1 (Debian 8 "Jessie" LTS).
