"response": {
"response_type": "EXTRACTED",
"data": {
"CVE_ID": "CVE-2017-12240",
"root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow condition in the DHCP relay subsystem of the affected software.",
"weaknesses": [
"Buffer Overflow"
],
"impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code and gain full control of an affected system. The attacker could also cause an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
"attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packet to an affected system.",
"attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DHCPv4 packets to a vulnerable Cisco device that is configured as a DHCP relay agent. The attacker is not required to authenticate to the device prior to exploitation.",
"other_details": "This vulnerability can be exploited only by DHCPv4 packets that are directed to an affected system. It cannot be exploited via DHCP Version 6 (DHCPv6) packets. In March 2022, Cisco became aware of additional attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild."
