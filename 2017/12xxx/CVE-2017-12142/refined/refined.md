Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-12142:

**Root Cause:**
- An invalid memory read vulnerability exists in the `SwapDWord` function within the `ytnef.c` file of the ytnef library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `SwapDWord` attempts to read memory at an invalid address, specifically address `0x000000000008`, which results in a segmentation fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to crash the application by providing a crafted file that triggers the invalid memory read.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specifically crafted TNEF file (winmail.dat).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need the ability to provide a crafted TNEF file to the ytnef library. This could be through a variety of methods, such as:
  - Email attachment (if the vulnerable software is processing email attachments)
  - Direct file processing (if the vulnerable software is processing files from user input)
  - Web service interaction (if the vulnerable software is part of a web application)
