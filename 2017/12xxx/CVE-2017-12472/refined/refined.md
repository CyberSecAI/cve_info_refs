Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-12472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from missing NULL pointer checks after calls to `ccnl_malloc` within `ccnl-ext-mgmt.c` in CCN-lite before version 2.00. The `ccnl_malloc` function is defined to be a standard `libc malloc()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing NULL pointer checks: After allocating memory with `ccnl_malloc`, the code fails to verify if the allocation was successful (i.e., if `malloc` returned a valid pointer). If `malloc` fails, it returns NULL. Dereferencing a NULL pointer results in undefined behavior, likely a crash.
- Multiple instances: The issue is present in several locations in `ccnl-ext-mgmt.c`, `ccnl-ext-nfnops.c`, `ccnl-ext-nfnkrivine.c`, `ccnl-core-util.c`, and `ccnl-uapi.c`.
- The code does not handle the scenario where memory allocation fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unspecified impact: The CVE description states that context-dependent attackers can have an "unspecified impact" due to these missing checks.
- Denial of service: If an attacker can cause `malloc` to fail (e.g., by causing the program to run out of memory), this can trigger a crash in the application, leading to a denial-of-service.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided content, a missing NULL pointer check could be a starting point for a more complex exploit chain, depending on how the allocated memory is subsequently used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited via the network since the component is part of a networking library (`CCN-lite`). The CVSS metrics also mention network as attack vector.
- Context-dependent: The vulnerability's impact is context-dependent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No privileges required: The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- No user interaction: The exploit does not require any user interaction.
- Low attack complexity: The attack can be performed without complex pre-conditions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is listed as having a "Critical" severity with a CVSS score of 9.8.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.0 of CCN-lite.
- The provided content mentions specific code snippets where the missing NULL pointer checks exist within the CCN-lite codebase, providing a more detailed insight into the vulnerable locations than the official CVE description.
- The issue was reported on the project's Github issue tracker, which allowed for identification of the vulnerable source code files and functions.

In summary, CVE-2017-12472 is a critical vulnerability in CCN-lite due to missing NULL pointer checks after memory allocations. This can lead to a denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution under certain conditions. The attacker does not need special privileges and the attack has low complexity, making it easily exploitable.
