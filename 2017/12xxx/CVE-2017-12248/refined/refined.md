Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the web framework code of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Software. Specifically, the software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The vulnerability is a reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser when they view a malicious page. This could lead to:
*   Theft of sensitive information (e.g. session cookies).
*   Redirection of users to malicious websites.
*   Defacement of the web interface.
*   Other actions that can be performed by the user with their current permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL that injects JavaScript into the vulnerable web interface. This URL is then delivered to the victim through social engineering. The user needs to click the malicious link in order to trigger the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs no authentication.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker must rely on user interaction (victim clicking the malicious link) to be successful.
*   The attacker must deliver the malicious link to the victim.
