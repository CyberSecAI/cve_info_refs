{
  "CVE-2017-12893": {
    "root_cause": "A missing bounds check in the `name_len()` function of `smbutil.c` when parsing SMB/CIFS packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A buffer over-read can lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can send a specially crafted SMB/CIFS packet to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the pointer is advanced based on the length value in the buffer, but a check is not made to ensure it points to something within the captured data. This can cause a buffer over-read."
