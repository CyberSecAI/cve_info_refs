Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12100:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the loading of old `Multires` structures from a `Mesh` into a newer format in Blender.
*   An integer overflow occurs when calculating the allocation size for base vertices, leading to an undersized buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The calculation of the buffer size for vertex mapping uses multiplication of the number of vertices by the size of an integer (4 bytes). This can overflow if the number of vertices is large enough.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  Due to the integer overflow, an undersized buffer is allocated. During the initialization of this buffer, out-of-bounds writes occur, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap-based buffer overflow allows an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Blender application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious .blend file:** An attacker crafts a malicious .blend file with specific properties (a large number of vertices in the multi-resolution mesh).
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious .blend file in Blender. This could involve sending the file via email, hosting it on a website, or any other way of enticing the user to open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious .blend file:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the contents of a .blend file to trigger the integer overflow and heap overflow.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to convince the victim to open the malicious file using the vulnerable application.

**Additional Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability resides in `multires_load_old_dm` function.
* When handling an older version of a .blend file, `blo_do_versions_250` will call `multires_load_old`.
* The `totvert` field from the loaded mesh structure is used in the vulnerable calculation.
* Specifically, the allocation happens at `MEM_callocN(sizeof(int) * totvert, "multires vvmap");`.
* The out of bounds write happens at `vvmap[totvert - lvl1->totvert + i] = src;`
* The vulnerable code is in `source/blender/blenkernel/intern/multires.c`

**CVSS Score:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a high severity.

This detailed explanation provides a good understanding of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
