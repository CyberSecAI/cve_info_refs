  "cve_id": "CVE-2017-12146",
  "description": "The driver_override implementation is susceptible to a race condition when different threads are reading vs storing a different driver override. Add locking to avoid a race condition.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `driver_override` attribute for platform devices in sysfs is susceptible to a race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in access to the `driver_override` attribute.",
      "Lack of locking mechanism to protect shared resource (pdev->driver_override)"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation if unprivileged users have access to the `driver_override` attribute.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the sysfs attribute `driver_override`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to access and manipulate the `driver_override` sysfs attribute concurrently."
