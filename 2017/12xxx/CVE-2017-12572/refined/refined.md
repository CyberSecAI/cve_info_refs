- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject malicious script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can inject and store arbitrary scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is launched through Splunk Web, where malicious scripts are injected and stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Administrative access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
