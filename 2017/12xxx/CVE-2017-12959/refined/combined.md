## [PSPP 1.0.1 has been released.](forum.php?forum_id=8936)

*Item posted by [Ben Pfaff <blp>](/users/blp) on Sun 27 Aug 2017 08:02:35 PM UTC.*

I'm very pleased to announce the release of a new version of GNU PSPP.  PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data.  It is a free replacement for the proprietary program SPSS.

This fixes a number of bugs that were reported as security vulnerabilities.  I do not think that that these are serious vulnerabilities.  I still recommend that users upgrade

Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1:

* Bug fixes, including fixes for CVE-2017-12958, CVE-2017-12959, CVE-2017-12960, and CVE-2017-12961.
