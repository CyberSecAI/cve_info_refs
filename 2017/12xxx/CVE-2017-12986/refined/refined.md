  "CVE-2017-12986": {
    "description": "The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-rt6.c:rt6_print().",
    "fixed_version": "4.9.2",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "cwe": "CWE-125",
        "root_cause": "The IPv6 routing header parser in tcpdump incorrectly handles the reserved field within the IPv6 routing header when printing, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Over-read"
        ],
        "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or possibly lead to arbitrary code execution by sending a crafted IPv6 packet with a specific routing header.",
         "attack_vectors": [
           "Network"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target machine running a vulnerable version of tcpdump.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `rt6_print()` function of `print-rt6.c`, where the code accesses and prints the reserved field of the IPv6 routing header without proper bounds checking.\nIn RFC 1883, the Type 0 routing header had a 1-byte reserved field and a 3-byte strict/loose bit map. In RFC 2460, this was changed to a 4-byte reserved field. The fix makes an `ND_TCHECK()` call to ensure the presence in the captured data of all 4 bytes of the reserved field."
