{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the calculation of buffer size, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer. Specifically, the multiplication of 'size' and 'count' overflows the 32-bit unsigned integer space, resulting in a much smaller buffer than expected being allocated.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause a crash due to memory corruption and may be exploitable for arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted image file (specifically, an ORF file in this case) using the vulnerable exiv2 library. The vulnerability is triggered in Exiv2::Image::io function when the program attempts to allocate memory based on an overflowed size.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to supply a crafted image file to the vulnerable exiv2 library. No specific user privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability if the program is run on the crafted file."
