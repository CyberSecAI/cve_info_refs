- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `SimpleSAML\Utils\Crypto` class uses AES in CBC mode without any authentication mechanism, making it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unauthenticated encryption in CBC mode.
    - Lack of integrity checks on the ciphertext.
    - Vulnerability to Padding Oracle Attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially:
    - Recover the original plaintext (session identifier) from the ciphertext.
    - Modify the ciphertext to decrypt into a different plaintext chosen by the attacker.
    - Impersonate a user by recovering the session identifier.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Eavesdropping on network traffic to capture encrypted session identifiers.
    - Exploiting the lack of authentication using padding oracle attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be in a position to eavesdrop on network traffic between the Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Provider (SP), specifically when HTTP POST requests are used over insecure channels.
    - The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate ciphertext.
