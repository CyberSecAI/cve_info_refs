                 CVE-2020-15305 CVE-2020-15306

Multiple security issues were found in the OpenEXR image library, which
could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of
arbitrary code when processing malformed EXR image files.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.0-11+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

## Binary packages built by this source

[libopenexr-dev](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/libopenexr-dev):
development files for the OpenEXR image library

OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by

Â Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.

Â .

Â OpenEXR's features include:

Â Â Â Â \* Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and

Â Â Â Â Â Â 10-bit image file formats.

Â Â Â Â \* Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.

Â Â Â Â \* Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the

Â Â Â Â Â Â included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on

Â Â Â Â Â Â images with film grain.

Â Â Â Â \* Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily

Â Â Â Â Â Â be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR

Â Â Â Â Â Â software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,

Â Â Â Â Â Â integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without

Â Â Â Â Â Â affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR

Â Â Â Â Â Â applications.

Â .

Â This package contains the header files required if you wish to

Â compile/develop applications that use OpenEXR libraries.

[libopenexr22](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/libopenexr22):

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# USN-4148-1: OpenEXR vulnerabilities

7 October 2019

Several security issues were fixed in OpenEXR.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [openexr](/security/cves?package=openexr) - command-line tools for the OpenEXR image format

## Details

It was discovered that OpenEXR incorrectly handled certain malformed EXR

image files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted EXR image file,

a remote attacker could cause a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2017-12596](/security/CVE-2017-12596))

Brandon Perry discovered that OpenEXR incorrectly handled certain malformed

EXR image files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted EXR image

file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
