- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Moxa EDR-810 device stores user credentials in plaintext within the `/magicP/cfg4.0/cfg_file/USER_ACCOUNT.CFG` file. This file mirrors the content of `/etc/shadow` but contains plaintext passwords instead of hashed ones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Plaintext storage of passwords (CWE-256).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with shell access to the device can extract user passwords in clear text.
- **Attack vectors**: Requires shell access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have shell access on the Moxa EDR-810 device.
