Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12082:

**Root Cause:**
- Integer overflow during allocation of memory for custom data layers in Blender when loading a .blend file with a specially crafted external data file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow (CWE-190):** The multiplication of `header->totlayer` and `sizeof(CDataFileLayer)` (84 bytes) is performed without proper bounds checking, which can lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller than expected allocation size.
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** Due to the undersized buffer allocation, a subsequent read from the external data file into this buffer overflows, overwriting adjacent heap memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap-based buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the Blender application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious .blend files:** An attacker can craft a malicious .blend file that includes an external custom data layer with a high `totlayer` value.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted .blend file and import a specific object which triggers the loading of the malicious external data, then attempt to edit the imported object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and distribute malicious .blend files.
- Ability to convince a user to import the malicious content into Blender.

**Technical Details:**
1.  The vulnerability is triggered during the loading of a Mesh object that uses external `CustomData` layers from a .blend file.
2.  During the loading process, the application reads the `totlayer` field from a header and multiplies it by the size of `CDataFileLayer` to determine the required buffer size.
3.  If `totlayer` is sufficiently large, the multiplication overflows, resulting in a smaller allocation.
4.  When data from the external file is read into the undersized buffer, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
5.  The application reads a structure `CDataFileLayer` which has a size of 84 bytes.
6.  The vulnerability occurs in the `cdf_read_header` function within `source/blender/blenkernel/intern/customdata_file.c`
7.  The vulnerability is triggered when editing a `Mesh` object with external `CustomData`.

**Additional notes:**
- The Talos report provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) python script to generate a malicious .blend file and a corresponding .data file.
- The crash information included in the report shows an access violation due to an out-of-bounds write.
- The Talos report also includes a CVSSv3 score of 8.8, indicating a high severity.

The Debian security advisories confirm that the vulnerability exists in the Blender package and has been fixed in the versions `2.79.b+dfsg0-1~deb9u1` (stable distribution) and `2.72.b+dfsg0-3+deb8u1` (Debian 8 "Jessie").
