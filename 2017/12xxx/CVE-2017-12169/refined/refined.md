The provided content relates to CVE-2017-12169.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficiently restrictive Access Control Instructions (ACIs) in the stage user container within IPA (Identity, Policy, Audit). This allowed users with the 'System: Read Stage Users' permission to read password hashes of stage users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: Password hashes of stage users were accessible to users with 'System: Read Stage Users' permission, violating the principle of least privilege.
- Inadequate ACI configuration: The ACIs for the stage user container were not strict enough, allowing read access to sensitive attributes like password hashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Password hash disclosure: A remote, authenticated attacker with the specified permission could retrieve password hashes of inactive/staged users.
- Potential offline attacks: The disclosed password hashes could be used for offline brute-force attacks, potentially compromising user accounts if the same passwords were used elsewhere.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The attack can be carried out remotely.
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have valid credentials and the 'System: Read Stage Users' permission in IPA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user within the IPA system.
- The attacker must have been granted the 'System: Read Stage Users' permission.
