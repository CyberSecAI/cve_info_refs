- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected Accent and Anthem pacemakers transmit unencrypted patient information via RF communications, and also store this information without encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A nearby attacker could potentially intercept and access sensitive patient data transmitted via RF. Additionally, access to stored patient information could be obtained.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through RF communications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be within sufficient proximity to the pacemaker to intercept RF communications. A high level of skill is required to exploit the vulnerability.
