Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-12282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability exists in the Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) ingress frame processing within Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of ANQP ingress frames.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the processing of ANQP frames related to Hotspot 2.0 functionality

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause an affected Cisco Wireless LAN Controller to restart unexpectedly.
- This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, disrupting wireless network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by sending crafted ANQP ingress frames to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be Layer 2 RF-adjacent to the vulnerable WLC.
- The attack is unauthenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within the radio frequency (RF) range of the target WLC.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to the network.
- Ability to craft and send specific ANQP frames.
