      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The ISAKMP parser in tcpdump contains a vulnerability in print-isakmp.c, specifically within several functions, that can lead to an infinite loop when processing a crafted notification payload.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Infinite loop vulnerability due to improper handling of ISAKMP notification payloads.",
        "Insufficient checks when parsing ISAKMP notification payloads.",
         "Incorrect interpretation of ISAKMP message structures."
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by triggering an infinite loop in the tcpdump process when it attempts to parse a specially crafted ISAKMP packet. This can lead to the tcpdump process becoming unresponsive and consuming excessive resources.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "By sending a malformed ISAKMP packet over the network.",
         "By loading a capture file containing the malicious packet."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump or provide a malicious capture file. No authentication is required. It is likely an adjacent or network based attacker."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
        "Resolution": "The vulnerability was fixed in tcpdump version 4.9.2, where changes were made to prevent the infinite loop when parsing notification payloads. The fix included not dissecting types without specific code and cleaning up printing of various ISAKMP payloads.",
        "Affected software": "tcpdump versions prior to 4.9.2.",
        "Affected products": [
            "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7",
             "macOS High Sierra 10.13, macOS Sierra 10.12.6, OS X El Capitan 10.11.6",
             "Gentoo",
             "Debian",
             "Apple macOS"
        ],
        "Credit": "The infinite loop was discovered by Forcepoint's security researchers Otto Airamo & Antti Levom√§ki."
