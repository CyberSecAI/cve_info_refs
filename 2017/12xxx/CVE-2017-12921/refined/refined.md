Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12921:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `PFileFlashPixView::GetGlobalInfoProperty` function within the libfpx library. This occurs when the function attempts to access memory via a NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to dereference a pointer that is NULL, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The application using the vulnerable libfpx library will crash due to a segmentation fault. In the provided context, the crash is shown to occur in `gm identify`, which is part of the graphicsmagick suite. This could prevent users from processing images if the application crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Image File:** An attacker can craft a specially designed FlashPIX image file that, when processed by an application using libfpx, will trigger the null pointer dereference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious FlashPIX file to a vulnerable application that uses libfpx. This could be through a file upload, email attachment, or any method that involves processing a provided image file with the affected library.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was found using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
- The affected version is libfpx 1.3.1_p6.
- There's no mention of a fixed version or a patch commit, which indicates the project is likely unmaintained, based on comments that the upstream website does not work.
- The vulnerability was triggered via the `gm identify` command line tool of GraphicsMagick.
- A reproducer is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00311-libfpx-NULLptr-PFileFlashPixView_GetGlobalInfoProperty>
