Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-12329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of command arguments within the command-line interface (CLI) parser of Cisco Firepower Extensible Operating System (FXOS) and NX-OS System Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The core weakness is a command injection vulnerability. This means that an attacker can insert malicious commands as part of the arguments passed to a vulnerable CLI command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the same privilege level as the user who is logged into the CLI.
*   **Cross-Context Execution (on multi-VDC systems):** On devices that support multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs), the vulnerability allows the attacker to potentially execute commands at the user's privilege level, but outside of their assigned virtual environment. This represents a privilege escalation or context escape.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to the affected Cisco device's CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be authenticated to the affected system via the CLI.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **No Workarounds:** The advisory explicitly states that there are no workarounds that fully mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** A wide range of Cisco products are affected, including Firepower 4100/9300 series, MDS 9000 series switches, Nexus series switches, and Unified Computing System Manager.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 (MEDIUM), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L.
*   **Internal Discovery:** This vulnerability was found during internal security testing at Cisco.
