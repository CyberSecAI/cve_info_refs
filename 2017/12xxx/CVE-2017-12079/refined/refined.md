- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability in `picasa.php` allows external access to files and directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Arbitrary file read vulnerability. The `prog_id` field in `picasa.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify files they should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can read arbitrary files on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access. By manipulating the `prog_id` field, an attacker can specify the path to a file to be read.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Photo Station instance. No authentication is required.
