  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A packaging error during the rebasing of pure-ftpd in Fedora caused the existing configuration to be ignored after an update. This resulted in the service running with default configurations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the packaging process that leads to the overriding of existing configurations with default settings.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The exploitation of this issue results in the overriding of potentially secure custom configurations with insecure default configurations.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves updating the pure-ftpd package in affected Fedora versions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to update the pure-ftpd package."
