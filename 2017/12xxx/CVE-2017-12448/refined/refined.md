The content is related to CVE-2017-12448.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of corrupt or nested archive files within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library. Specifically, when a corrupt archive is encountered, the wrong memory releasing functions are used, and pointers to freed memory are not cleared. Later, when another element is freed, these stale pointers are encountered, triggering the use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: After a memory region is freed, a stale pointer continues to reference that region. Subsequent access through this dangling pointer can lead to undefined behavior, such as crashing or execution of arbitrary code.
- Incorrect archive parsing: The code was not robust enough to handle corrupted or malformed archive files, which led to improper memory management.
- Lack of proper pointer cleanup: Pointers to freed memory were not being cleared, making them susceptible to be used later and cause a use-after-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The primary impact is a crash when processing a crafted archive file.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly mentioned, use-after-free vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution with further investigation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious archive file: An attacker can craft a malicious archive file that exploits the described vulnerability.
- Input to `objdump` or other programs: Programs such as `objdump` that use the BFD library to process archive files are vulnerable when handling the malicious input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a maliciously crafted file as an input to the vulnerable program.
- No special access privileges are required. The vulnerability is triggered by parsing the malformed input file.
