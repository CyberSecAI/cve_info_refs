| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=21787#c0)  Ned Williamson    2017-07-19 01:07:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10272](attachment.cgi?id=10272 "testcase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10272&action=edit "testcase") testcase  A heap-use-after-free is triggered when the provided file is scanned using `./objdump -x use-after-free`. All targets must be enabled; I believe the bug is in the XCOFF archive format.  I used ASAN to detect the crash. If you have trouble reproducing this (valgrind may work as well, but I haven't checked), let me know. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=21787#c1)  Ned Williamson    2017-07-19 01:08:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10273](attachment.cgi?id=10273 "crash state") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10273&action=edit "crash state") crash state  ASAN output for crashing state. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=21787#c2)  Sourceware Commits    2017-07-19 13:50:25 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Nick Clifton <nickc@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=909e4e716c4d77e33357bbe9bc902bfaf2e1af24>  commit 909e4e716c4d77e33357bbe9bc902bfaf2e1af24 Author: Nick Clifton <nickc@redhat.com> Date:   Wed Jul 19 14:49:12 2017 +0100      Fix use-after-free error when parsing a corrupt nested archive.

The problem is an interesting one because the code is actually set up to   prevent the use-after-free from happening.  In the normal course of events   when an element of an archive is no longer needed and the memory is freed,   all pointers to it will be tidied away.  But in this case, because the   archive is corrupt, the wrong set of memory releasing functions are being   used and the pointers are not tidied away.  Later on, when another element   is freed, the stale pointer is encountered and the bug triggered.    I have checked in a patch to fix the problem.  It makes the test for a    genuine archive be more aggressive when it signals that an archive is    corrupt, forcing the format matching mechanism to declare it as unrecognised   long before it can cause any memory corruption.  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=21787#c4)  Sourceware Commits    2017-09-04 15:15:54 UTC  ``` The binutils-2_29-branch branch has been updated by Nick Clifton <nickc@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;h=a541116faa5716d5c1a4bc9d1567855902b89a87>  commit a541116faa5716d5c1a4bc9d1567855902b89a87 Author: Nick Clifton <nickc@redhat.com> Date:   Mon Sep 4 16:14:19 2017 +0100      Import patch from mainline to improve reporting of corrupt archives.

With git master BFD, I get:              $ ./doit ./universal-exe         die: not an archive          Jeff Muizelaar tracked this down to the BFD change for [PR binutils/21787](show_bug.cgi?id=21787 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in bfd_cache_close").     This patch changed bfd_generic_archive_p to sometimes reset the BFD's     "format" field.          However, simply changing bfd_generic_archive_p regressed the test case     in that bug.          Debugging [PR binutils/21787](show_bug.cgi?id=21787 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in bfd_cache_close") again, what I saw is that the mach-o     universal binary support acts like a bfd_archive but does not provide     a _close_and_cleanup function.  However, if a BFD appears as an     archive member, it must always remove its own entry from its parent's     map.  Otherwise, when the parent is destroyed, the already-destroyed     child BFD will be referenced.  mach-o does not use the usual archive     member support, so simply using _bfd_archive_close_and_cleanup (as     other targets do) will not work.          This patch fixes the problem by introducing a new     _bfd_unlink_from_archive_parent function, then arranging for it to be     called in the mach-o case.          Ok?          bfd/ChangeLog     2018-07-02  Jeff Muizelaar  <jrmuizel@gmail.com>     	    Tom Tromey  <tom@tromey.com>          	[PR 13157](show_bug.cgi?id=13157 "NEW - fsf gdb x86_64-apple-darwin cannot load \"Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures\" executables")     	[PR 21787](show_bug.cgi?id=21787 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in bfd_cache_close")     	* mach-o.c (bfd_mach_o_fat_close_and_cleanup): New function.
