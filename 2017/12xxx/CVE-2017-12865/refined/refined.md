Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-12865:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `parse_response` function within `src/dnsproxy.c` of ConnMan. Specifically, the issue lies in how the function processes compressed DNS messages from external DNS servers. When expanding compressed messages recursively, a stack buffer overflow can occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The `get_name` function which is called by `parse_response` does not properly check the size of the 'name' buffer during the expansion of compressed DNS messages.  It can write beyond the allocated space on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the ConnMan service, disrupting network connectivity. If the ConnMan process isn't set to automatically restart, the affected device will lose network access.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some cases, the overflow can be exploited to achieve remote code execution with the privileges of the ConnMan process. This allows an attacker to potentially gather information, spoof, eavesdrop, or create backdoors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted DNS packets: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted DNS response to the victim device's DNS proxy.  The malicious DNS response is constructed to trigger the buffer overflow during the recursive message decompression process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the DNS server responses that the victim device receives. This means they must be able to intercept or spoof DNS traffic to the target.  
- The victim must use an unreliable network where the attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack (like a free public access point) because the victim's client should not be connected to an unreliable network.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by security consultants at NRI Secure Technologies.
- The vulnerability is referred to as "ConnManDo".
- The fix involves adding size checks to the `get_name` function to prevent writing past the end of the `name` buffer.
- The affected versions of ConnMan are 1.34 and earlier. The fix is included in version 1.35 and later.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.1 (High).
- A proof of concept (PoC) has been created, but it is not publicly available.
