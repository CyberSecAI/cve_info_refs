- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The pacemaker's authentication algorithm, involving an authentication key and a time stamp, can be compromised or bypassed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Authentication (CWE-287).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A nearby attacker may gain unauthorized access to the pacemaker and issue commands, change settings, or otherwise interfere with its intended function.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via radio frequency (RF) communications. The attacker needs to be within RF range of the target pacemaker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be physically close to the pacemaker to establish RF communication and must possess high technical skills.
