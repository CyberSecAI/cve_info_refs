The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12726.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Telnet service on the Smiths Medical Medfusion 4000 Wireless Syringe Infusion Pump utilizes hardcoded credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of Hard-coded Credentials: The Telnet service uses static, easily discoverable credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the communications module of the pump.
- Limited Impact: The impact is limited to the communications module, and it is not possible to upload files through Telnet according to the vendor. This limits the potential to directly affect the therapeutic module. However, the ability to potentially modify the communication module can have wider ranging impact not specified in the advisory

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the pump.
- Knowledge of hardcoded credentials: The attacker must know the hardcoded credentials for Telnet.
- Specific configuration: The pump must be configured to allow external communications, including the Telnet service.
- Skilled attacker: A high skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the Telnet service is only accessible if the pump is configured to allow external communications.
- The vendor assessed that it is not possible to upload files via Telnet.
- The advisory provides a CVSS v3 base score of 5.6 with the vector string (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
- The document includes recommendations to disable the Telnet service and ensure that all unused ports are closed, to include port 23/TELNET
