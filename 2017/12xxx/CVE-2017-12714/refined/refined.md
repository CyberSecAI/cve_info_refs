- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The pacemakers do not restrict or limit the number of correctly formatted "RF wake-up" commands that can be received.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper restriction of power consumption (CWE-920).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A nearby attacker can repeatedly send commands to reduce the pacemaker battery life, potentially causing it to deplete prematurely.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via RF communications by an attacker in close proximity to the pacemaker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be nearby the pacemaker to establish RF communication and possess the ability to generate correctly formatted RF wake-up commands. The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction.
