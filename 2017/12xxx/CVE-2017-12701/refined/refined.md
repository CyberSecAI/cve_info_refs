- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the Wi-Fi module of the Luna CPAP machine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the inadequate validation of input to the Wi-Fi module, which can lead to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause a denial-of-service condition by crashing the device's Wi-Fi module. The primary impact is on the communication functionality of the device, not the therapy delivery itself.
- **Attack vectors:** Adjacent network access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the CPAP machine and requires low skill to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to be authenticated.
