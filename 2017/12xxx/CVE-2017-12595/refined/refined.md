Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12595:

**1. Verification of Relevance**
   - The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3638-1) explicitly lists CVE-2017-12595 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in a QPDF update.
   - The provided github commit also refers to issue #146, which is linked in the USN.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is improper handling of malformed PDF files by QPDF. Specifically, it relates to deeply nested arrays and dictionaries within the PDF structure, leading to a stack overflow. The parser was implemented recursively which caused a stack overflow on these very deeply nested PDF structures. The fix was to implement the parser iteratively.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stack Overflow:** The recursive nature of the parsing function `QPDFObjectHandle::parseInternal` led to stack exhaustion when processing deeply nested PDF structures.
   - **Malformed File Handling:** The application did not properly validate or handle malformed PDF files leading to the above stack exhaustion vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause QPDF to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
   - **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu notice indicates the possibility of arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the other provided content. The stack corruption detected by GDB hints at this possibility.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file with deeply nested arrays or dictionaries.
   - **Remote Attack:** The Ubuntu notice specifies a "remote attacker" as someone who can provide a malicious file to the application.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to be processed by a vulnerable version of QPDF.
   - No specific position is mentioned, other than being able to provide a specially crafted PDF file.

**Additional Details:**
    - The provided GitHub commit shows that the parsing logic was changed to an iterative implementation from a recursive one to avoid stack overflow issues. This is shown in the changes in `libqpdf/QPDFObjectHandle.cc`.
   - Issue #146 mentions "stack corruption" and that GDB identified the crash as a possible "stack corruption" due to "return addresses that were not mapped in the inferior's process address space." This is additional information and strengthens the assertion that a stack overflow occurs.
   - The test case `qpdf/qtest/qpdf/issue-146.out` confirms that the crafted file results in warnings about a damaged file and inability to find the startxref.

In summary, CVE-2017-12595 arises from QPDF's inability to handle malformed PDF files with deeply nested structures, leading to a stack overflow which can cause a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution, and can be exploited by a remote attacker.
