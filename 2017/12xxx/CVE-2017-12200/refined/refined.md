Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The WordPress plugin "Product Catalog" (version 4.2.11) contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in its `Process_Ajax.php` file. The plugin uses user-supplied input from `$_POST` parameters directly within SQL queries without sanitization or proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability exists in multiple functions within `Process_Ajax.php` where data from various `$_POST` parameters (e.g., 'list-item', 'video-item', 'category-product-item') is used directly in SQL UPDATE queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The provided images suggest a separate XSS vulnerability exists, although the specific location and details of the XSS vulnerability are not included in the provided code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   An attacker could modify, delete, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   The attacker could potentially gain full control of the WordPress site by gaining access to administrator credentials.
*    **XSS**
    *   An attacker could execute malicious javascript code within the browser of a victim user.
    *   This code can be used to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors for the SQL Injection vulnerabilities are the various AJAX actions exposed by the plugin through the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. Attackers can send malicious POST requests to these endpoints with crafted parameters.
*   The attack vector for the XSS vulnerability is not detailed, but based on the images it could be through a form input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the relevant `action` parameter and a malicious payload within the associated POST parameter (e.g., `list-item`, `video-item`, etc.)
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious javascript code in to the affected form input, and trick a user to visit that page.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**

*   The provided content offers specific code snippets showing the vulnerable functions and parameters which are not in the official CVE description.
*   The content provides details on the different vulnerable AJAX actions/parameters.
*   The provided content details the SQL injection impact and provides SQLMap PoC.
*   The content provides a PoC for XSS exploit, but not its location in the code.
