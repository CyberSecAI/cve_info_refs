Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12366:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The core weakness is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing a remote attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application.
*   The specific injection point isn't specified in the provided text, but it is an XSS vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Phishing attacks by redirecting to malicious sites
    *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction; the user must click a link or visit a page with the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate to the Cisco WebEx system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code through an input field or a URL parameter.
*   The attacker needs to persuade a user to interact with their crafted request to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The CVSS score is 6.1 with vector: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`
*   This indicates that the attack vector is Network, attack complexity is Low, no privileges are required, user interaction is Required, scope is Changed, confidentiality impact is Low, integrity impact is Low and availability impact is None.
*   Cisco has assigned bug IDs [CSCvf78635](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvf78635) and [CSCvg52440](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg52440) for this vulnerability which can provide additional information.
*   No workarounds are available. The fix requires updating the Cisco WebEx software.
