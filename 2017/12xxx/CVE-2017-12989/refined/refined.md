  "CVE-2017-12989": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple Sources",
      "CWE": "CWE-835",
      "Description": "The RESP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 could enter an infinite loop due to a bug in print-resp.c:resp_get_length()."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "A bug in the `resp_get_length()` function within the RESP parser of tcpdump.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Infinite loop vulnerability due to improper handling of invalid length strings in RESP protocol.",
         "The function doesn't handle invalid characters in the length field correctly, leading to an infinite loop if such characters are encountered."
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of Service. The vulnerability can cause the tcpdump application to enter an infinite loop, rendering it unresponsive and consuming system resources.",
        "Attack Vectors": [
         "Network traffic containing a malformed RESP length field."
        ],
        "Attacker Capabilities": "An attacker can send a crafted network packet with a malformed RESP length field to trigger the infinite loop. No special privileges are needed.",
       "Required Attacker Position": "The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the system running tcpdump and be able to send malformed RESP traffic. This could be a man-in-the-middle position, or sending traffic towards a system running tcpdump."

    },
    "Affected Systems": [
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (multiple architectures)",
      "macOS High Sierra 10.13",
      "macOS Sierra 10.12.6",
        "OS X El Capitan 10.11.6",
        "Debian (jessie, stretch)",
      "Gentoo (net-analyzer/tcpdump < 4.9.2)"
   ],
    "Technical Details": {
        "Code Modification": "The fix involves modifying the `resp_get_length()` function in `print-resp.c` to ensure that it advances the pointer past any invalid characters in the length string and returns an error code, preventing the infinite loop.",
        "Code Location": "`print-resp.c`",
        "Affected Function": "`resp_get_length()`"
    },
        "Additional Information": {
         "Fix Details": "The fix ensures that the function always advances the pointer before returning and handles invalid length characters by moving the pointer past the invalid character, to avoid an infinite loop."
