- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication when writing a program to the memory module of an Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 PLC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is an unauthenticated file write to the PLC's memory module. This allows an attacker to overwrite the PLC's program without any form of authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can write a malicious program to the PLC's memory module. This can be used as a backup, loaded when errors occur, or loaded every time the device is powered on. This can lead to complete control over the PLC's functionality and potentially cause physical damage to the system controlled by the PLC.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is sending a specially crafted packet over the network. The exploit uses EtherNet/IP protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the PLC and have the capability to send crafted packets. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
