Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12427:

**1. Verification:**

The Gentoo Security Advisory explicitly lists CVE-2017-12427 as one of the multiple vulnerabilities found in ImageMagick. The advisory also mentions that the vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service condition or have unspecified impacts. Thus, the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a memory leak in the `WriteMSLImage` function, specifically when processing MSL (Magick Scripting Language) files. This is further substantiated by the github issue #636 and the related commit.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak within the `ProcessMSLScript` and `WriteMSLImage` functions in `coders/msl.c`. Specifically, memory allocated in `ProcessMSLScript` was not being released under certain conditions.
   - **Unreleased Memory:** The code was allocating memory using `AcquireMagickMemory` within `ProcessMSLScript` but it was not being deallocated which causes a leak. This can be seen in the stack traces from the issue report.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leaks can lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing a denial-of-service condition. This is mentioned in the Gentoo Security Advisory as one of the potential impacts.
   - **Resource Exhaustion:** The attacker can cause the application to exhaust available memory, eventually leading to failure.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Specially Crafted File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted MSL file. The attacker would need to entice a user or an application to process this file using ImageMagick.
   - **Command Line:** As shown in the github issue report, the vulnerability is triggered by using `magick convert` to convert the crafted MSL file.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this remotely by sending or making a user process a crafted file.
   - **Ability to Craft Files:** The attacker needs the ability to craft or modify the msl files to trigger the memory leak.
   - **Target Must Process File:** The target system must process the crafted MSL file using a vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The GitHub issue #636 provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) file and command to reproduce the memory leak.
*   The stack trace included in the GitHub issue report shows the exact location of the leak within the `ProcessMSLScript` and `WriteMSLImage` functions, specifically in `coders/msl.c`.
*   The fix, as seen in the commit `e793eb2`, involves ensuring memory is released using `RelinquishMagickMemory` after use, within `ProcessMSLScript`.

**Summary of changes from the commit:**

The commit message links the fix to the identified issue. The commit primarily includes changes to `coders/msl.c`:
  -  Adding multiple `RelinquishMagickMemory` calls to free memory allocated within the function including image and drawing related data.

This vulnerability is a memory leak caused by improper resource management during the processing of MSL files in ImageMagick. The impact of exploitation could range from a denial of service to more severe effects. It can be triggered by a remote attacker by having a target process a crafted MSL file using ImageMagick. The fix is to properly deallocate the allocated memory when processing MSL files.
