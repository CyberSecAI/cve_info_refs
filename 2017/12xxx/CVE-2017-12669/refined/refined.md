Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory leak in the `WriteCALSImage` function within the `cals.c` file of the ImageMagick library. Specifically, a cloned image info structure is not being deallocated when an error occurs during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak: The code allocates memory for an image info structure using `AcquireImageInfo` which is cloned with `CloneImageInfo`, but it fails to free this cloned structure in all error paths within the `WriteCALSImage` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeated exploitation of this memory leak could lead to memory exhaustion, potentially crashing the application or the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input file processing: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file that will cause the `WriteCALSImage` function to fail. The issue is triggered when writing out a CALS image format, so any file that is converted to that format using ImageMagick could trigger this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to process images using ImageMagick, which is a common task in many applications. They need to be able to control the input file processed by ImageMagick.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided github issue and commit link indicate that the vulnerability was reported and fixed, with the fix being adding an additional `DestroyImageInfo` call to release the memory allocated with the clone.
- The code snippet shows where the fix was implemented, deallocating the `write_info` structure before returning on error from `WriteCALSImage`.
- The `AddressSanitizer` output shows a direct leak of 13024 bytes.
- The vulnerability is present in ImageMagick version 7.0.6-2 Q16 x86_64 and was fixed with the commit `73b6c35cede48ccb2e29dbe62c2d77488e5e70b7`
