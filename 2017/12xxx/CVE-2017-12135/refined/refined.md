Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-12135:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from two main issues within the handling of transitive grants in the Xen hypervisor:
1. **Unbounded Recursion:** The code for handling copy operations on transitive grants employs a retry mechanism by recursively calling the same function with unchanged parameters. This assumes the compiler will translate this into a tail call, which isn't always the case, leading to potentially unbounded nesting of function calls and stack exhaustion.
2. **Broken Reference Counting and Locking:** The reference counting and locking mechanisms for transitive grants are flawed. Concurrent usage can result in reference leaks on the transitively-referenced grant.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper use of recursion without ensuring tail call optimization.
- Incorrect locking discipline for shared resources.
- Faulty reference counting leading to memory leaks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A malicious or buggy guest can crash the Xen hypervisor. They can also cause a DoS against the grantee by leaking references on grants.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Privilege escalation is not definitively confirmed but cannot be ruled out.
- **Information Leaks:** Information leaks also cannot be ruled out.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or buggy guest can manipulate grant tables in a specific manner to trigger the vulnerable code paths.
- Concurrent usage of transitive grants can also be leveraged.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a guest domain within a Xen environment.
- The guest needs access to transitive grants.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Xen.
- The provided information indicates that the issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE. Amazon also helped identify the depth of the problem.
- The initial mitigation was to disable transitive grants but later patches provided fixes for the underlying issues.
- Debian security advisory DSA-3969-1 also lists this CVE along with others affecting xen package.
- Red Hat bugzilla indicates that this is a security issue, tracked with bug ID 1477655, which is closed as 'WONTFIX'.
- The vulnerability was also referenced in Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 201801-14, which advised users to upgrade their Xen packages to version 4.9.1-r1 or later.
