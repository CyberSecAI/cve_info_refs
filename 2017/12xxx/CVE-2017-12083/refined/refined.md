- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition in the `apid` daemon of Circle with Disney devices. This occurs due to the reuse of the `add_to_request` function for handling both HTTP headers and body parameters. Specifically, the `realloc` function within `add_data` can return a different memory location, invalidating pointers to HTTP header values that were previously stored.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Use-After-Free (UAF):** Pointers to HTTP header values like 'Origin', 'User-Agent', 'Host', 'Cookie', and 'Authorization' become dangling pointers when the underlying buffer is reallocated, due to how `realloc` can change the address of the allocated memory.
    - **Improper memory management:** The code does not properly handle the scenario where `realloc` returns a new memory address, causing previously set pointers to point to freed memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the device's memory by controlling the size of the HTTP request, which results in a heap memory overwrite with contents of `/mnt/shares/usr/bin/configure.xml` which contains sensitive data like phone numbers, emails and device names. Specifically, the 'Origin' header, which is returned in the HTTP response, can be exploited to leak data from the heap after the UAF is triggered.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests (POST) with a specific size and content-length parameters to the `/api/USERINFO` endpoint. This causes the server to reallocate the request buffer, invalidating pointers to header values.
    - The attacker pads the HTTP method line to land the strdup in the same heap bin as the request.
    - The attacker induces the allocation of sensitive data (`configure.xml`) into the heap slot previously used by the HTTP header buffer.
    - By triggering the UAF, the attacker retrieves the sensitive data in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header of the response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs network connectivity to the internet in order to reach the device running `apid` daemon.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    - No special capabilities are needed beyond the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
    - The attacker has to be able to cause a realloc and free of the initial http request memory buffer.
