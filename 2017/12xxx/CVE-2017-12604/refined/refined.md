Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-12604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause lies in vulnerabilities within the OpenCV library when handling image data, specifically during the reading process.
- Early versions of OpenCV have problems while reading data, which might result in buffer overflows, out-of-bounds errors, or integer overflows.
- Specifically, a malformed image file read using the `cv::imread` function can trigger these issues.
- Incorrect integer casts can also lead to assertion errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A heap-based buffer overflow can occur due to an invalid size calculation or insufficient buffer allocation when processing image data. This results in writing beyond the allocated memory boundary.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** Out-of-bounds write errors occur when the program attempts to write data to a memory location outside of the allocated buffer.
- **Integer overflow:** Integer overflows can occur when performing calculations related to image dimensions, leading to incorrect memory allocation sizes and subsequent buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes.
- **Assertion errors**: Incorrect integer casts can lead to assertion errors, which may also lead to crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerabilities can lead to crashes (segmentation faults), effectively causing a denial of service.
- **Memory Corruption:** Successful exploitation can corrupt memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in some cases.
- **Unspecified impact**:  The Debian advisory also mentions that the issues "may lead to a denial-of-service or other unspecified impact."
- The Github issue mentions that the bugs "may be potential security threat."

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed Image Files:** Attackers can craft malicious image files with specific properties to trigger the vulnerabilities when processed by `cv::imread`.
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerabilities are present during the parsing of image data, particularly in the BMP format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file to the application using OpenCV.
- The attacker needs to get the vulnerable application to process the malicious image file. This might involve tricking a user into opening such a file.

**Additional details:**
* The Github issue #9309 provides specific examples of crashes, including valgrind outputs, when processing malformed BMP files. It also points to a repository with test cases for further analysis.
* The gentoo security advisory mentions "other memory corruption attacks" as a possible impact.
