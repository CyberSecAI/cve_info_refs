Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12103:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `BKE_vfont_to_curve_ex` function within Blender. This function is responsible for converting text rendered as a font into a curve. When allocating memory for the wide-character representation of the text, the code calculates the required buffer size by adding 1 to the length of the text and multiplying by the size of a `wchar_t`.  If the text length is close to the maximum value of a signed integer, the multiplication can cause an integer overflow which results in an undersized buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The calculation `(slen + 1) * sizeof(wchar_t)` can result in an integer overflow when `slen` (text length) is a large value, leading to an undersized buffer allocation.
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** After the undersized buffer is allocated, the `BLI_strncpy_wchar_from_utf8` function attempts to convert a UTF-8 string to wide characters, and writes the converted characters into the undersized buffer, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not adequately validate the length of the text before allocating memory, making it susceptible to this integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Blender application. An attacker can gain control over the user's system by crafting a malicious .blend file.
- **Denial of Service:** A crash occurs, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious .blend files:** An attacker can create a malicious .blend file that contains specially crafted text data with a length that will trigger the overflow.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker can then convince a victim to open the malicious .blend file, either directly or indirectly (e.g., importing it as a library).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create a malicious .blend file:** The attacker needs to be able to create a file that contains the specific data structures that trigger the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open the malicious file using standard social engineering techniques.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs when converting text to a `Curve` object specifically when the `ob->type` is `OB_FONT(4)`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted .blend file, using it as a library, or passing it as an argument to the Blender executable.
- The vulnerable code is located in `source/blender/blenkernel/intern/font.c` in the `BKE_vfont_to_curve_ex` function and the `source/blender/blenlib/intern/string_utf8.c` in the `BLI_strncpy_wchar_from_utf8` function.
- The Talos report includes a crash dump and exploit proof-of-concept.
