Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The CSRF prevention mechanism in Keycloak used a cookie that was not unique to each user session. This allowed an attacker to potentially reuse a valid CSRF token from one session in another.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate CSRF protection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper session-specific CSRF token generation.
- Session fixation: The reuse of a single CSRF token across sessions leads to session fixation vulnerabilities

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to an authenticated user's session.
- Information disclosure: With access to a user session, sensitive information could be exposed.
- Further attacks: The compromised session could be used as a stepping stone for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack likely involves tricking a user into performing a state changing action on the application via a crafted request that uses a valid CSRF token from another user.
- The attacker would need to have acquired a CSRF token.
- The attacker does not need to be a valid user of the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker would have to send a crafted request via a browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malicious requests
- Knowledge of the target system's CSRF handling mechanism.
- Ability to get a valid CSRF token from the target system.
