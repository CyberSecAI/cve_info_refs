Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12267:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists in the Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) accelerator feature of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS). This vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow (CWE-119).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow (CWE-119):** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the ICA accelerator feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Partial Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation causes an ICA application optimization-related process to restart, leading to a partial DoS condition. This restart disrupts the application optimization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
- No authentication is needed.
- The attacker needs the ability to send a specific network request that will trigger the buffer overflow within the ICA Accelerator.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability affects both Cisco WAAS and Cisco vWAAS.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability other than applying the software fix provided by Cisco.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 5.8.
- According to the advisory, Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public exploits or malicious use of the vulnerability as of the date of the advisory (October 4, 2017).
