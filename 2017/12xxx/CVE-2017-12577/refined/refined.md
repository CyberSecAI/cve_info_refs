Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the presence of a hardcoded credential ("admin:password") within the PLANEX CS-QR20 device's mobile application. This credential is used to control the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The application uses a fixed, unchangeable "admin:password" combination, which cannot be modified by the user.
- **Insecure Permissions:** The hardcoded credentials can be used to access hidden APIs and execute commands with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the device with root permissions by leveraging the hardcoded credentials through a hidden API URL.
- **Full Device Control:** The hardcoded credentials allow an attacker to fully control the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be conducted remotely.
- **Predefined Default Password:** Attackers exploit the predefined default password to gain access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must know the hardcoded credential ("admin:password").
- The attacker must be able to access the device's web management UI or the mobile application's API.
