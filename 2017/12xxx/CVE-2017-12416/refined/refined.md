- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because PAN-OS does not properly validate specific request parameters in the GlobalProtect internal and external gateway interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary Javascript or HTML, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-based and requires user interaction, as the attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with the crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special privileges but must trick a user into interacting with the malicious link or request parameters.
