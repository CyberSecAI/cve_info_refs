Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue present in the Cisco Unified Intelligence Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-352:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This means the application doesn't properly validate requests originating from a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute unwanted actions on the Cisco Unified Intelligence Center. The severity is rated as "Medium".
* The impact includes potential for limited loss of confidentiality and integrity. The CVSS score reflects low confidentiality and integrity impact. Availability is not affected

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N):** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
*   **User Interaction (UI:R):** The attacker needs the victim to perform some action to initiate the attack, like clicking a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated (PR:N):** The attacker doesn't need any user credentials to initiate the attack.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be located remotely, needing network access to reach the vulnerable system.
*   Attacker needs to craft a malicious request that the victim's browser will then submit to the vulnerable server.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N**
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The attack vector is through the network.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low, requiring minimal effort from the attacker.
    *   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
    *  **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required for successful exploitation
    *   **S:C (Changed):** The vulnerability impacts beyond the affected component.
    *  **C:L (Low):**  Confidentiality impact is low.
     *   **I:L (Low):**  Integrity impact is low.
    *   **A:N (None):** There is no impact on availability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing.
*   There are no known workarounds.
*   Cisco has released fixed software to address this issue.
*   The Cisco Bug ID associated with this vulnerability is CSCve76872.
