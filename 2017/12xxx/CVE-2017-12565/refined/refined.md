The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12565.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `ReadOneJNGImage` function within `png.c` due to improper resource management when handling crafted JNG image files. Specifically, memory allocated within the `ReadOneJNGImage` function is not properly freed in certain scenarios, resulting in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: Unreleased memory in the `ReadOneJNGImage` function leading to resource exhaustion over time.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By repeatedly processing crafted JNG files, an attacker can cause the application to exhaust available memory, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted Image Files: The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted JNG image file to the `convert` utility (or a similar tool) from the ImageMagick suite.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted JNG file to the ImageMagick library. This may occur over different interfaces, like a user providing a file to a web service, or an attacker having direct access to the system.
