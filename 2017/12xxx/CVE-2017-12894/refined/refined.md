{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing length check in the `lookup_bytestring()` function within the `addrtoname.c` file of tcpdump. During a hash table search, the code doesn't properly account for the length of byte strings, potentially reading beyond the allocated memory when encountering a shorter string than the one being searched for.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service due to a buffer over-read. Arbitrary code execution is also possible, although less likely based on the information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network traffic"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic that tcpdump will process. No special privileges are required."
