  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenCV, including a denial of service via excessive CPU or memory consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Excessive CPU consumption",
       "Excessive memory consumption"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service condition, either by exhausting CPU resources or memory, or conduct other memory corruption attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The specific attack vectors are not detailed in this document but are referenced in the linked github issue and code examples. The vulnerability can likely be triggered by processing a crafted image file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file to OpenCV for processing"
  },
  "affected_packages": [
    {
      "name": "media-libs/opencv",
      "affected_versions": "< 2.4.13-r3",
      "unaffected_versions": ">= 2.4.13-r3"
    }
  ],
    "additional_notes": "The provided information references multiple CVEs. It is likely that CVE-2017-12600 refers to one of the DoS bugs described in the github issue, which involve excessive CPU or memory use, but the exact nature of the vulnerability is not detailed in this document. The github issue #9311 mentions two DoS bugs, one of which exhausts CPU and another which exhausts memory. The specific functions or image codecs vulnerable to the denial of service are not provided in this document but referenced in external links."
