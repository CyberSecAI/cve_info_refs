Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-12785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a combination of a buffer overflow and command injection within the `novish` CLI (Command Line Interface).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  A buffer overflow occurs when a long string is provided as input to the `show log cli username` command. This overflow can overwrite memory and potentially allow the attacker to control the program execution.
*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability also mentions command injection which suggests that the overflow could be used to inject arbitrary code that can be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A low-privileged user with access to the CLI can escalate their privileges to root. This allows the attacker to execute commands with the highest level of privileges on the system.
*   The exploitation causes the CLI to crash and the session to end, which could be used for denial of service, but the primary impact is privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local, and the user has to be logged in to the appliance via SSH.
*   The attack is triggered by executing a specific CLI command with a long string that causes the buffer overflow in `novish`.
    `noviswitch# show log cli username AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the NoviFlow device's command-line interface (CLI).
*   The user does not need to be a root user initially to exploit this vulnerability.
