The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12576.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a hidden and undocumented management page, `/admin/system_command.asp`, intended for debugging purposes, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   Insecure Permissions: The hidden page does not enforce adequate access controls.
-   Lack of input sanitization: The system allows execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker, after successful authentication to the device, can execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker needs to connect to the hidden and undocumented management page (`/admin/system_command.asp`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to reach the hidden management page and has to authenticate to the device first.
