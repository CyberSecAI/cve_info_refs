- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server of Moxa EDR-810 device lacks proper server-side input validation for the IP address parameter in the ping functionality. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into a system command executed by the server using `sprintf` and `system` functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78) is present due to the lack of server-side input sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary commands via the `ip` parameter within the `/goform/net_WebPingGetValue` URI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges, leading to privilege escalation, potentially gaining full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable URI `/goform/net_WebPingGetValue`, injecting malicious OS commands into the `ip` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the device's web interface, requiring prior authentication. The attacker also needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
