{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Epson EasyMP protocol lacks lockout or throttling functionality after multiple failed password attempts, making it susceptible to brute force attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of lockout or throttling after multiple failed password attempts.",
    "Small keyspace of 10,000 possible 4-digit PIN combinations."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access to the Epson projector, including remote streaming of the attacker's screen over wifi.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based brute force attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the projector and have the ability to send network packets to the projector."
