## Details

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Jan H. Schönherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle

block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm

could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2017-12134](/security/CVE-2017-12134))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-13220](/security/CVE-2017-13220))

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device

driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18079](/security/CVE-2017-18079))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18221](/security/CVE-2017-18221))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.

                               version 3

            linux: Fix Xen block IO merge-ability calculation

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The block layer in Linux may choose to merge adjacent block IO requests.
When Linux is running as a Xen guest, the default merging algorithm is
replaced with a Xen-specific one.  When Linux is running as an x86 PV
guest, some BIO's are erroneously merged, corrupting the data stream
to/from the block device.

This can result in incorrect access to an uncontrolled adjacent frame.

IMPACT
======

A buggy or malicious guest can cause Linux to read or write incorrect
memory when processing a block stream.  This could leak information from
other guests in the system or from Xen itself, or be used to DoS or
escalate privilege within the system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All x86 Xen systems using pvops Linux in a backend role (either as
dom0, or as a disk device driver domain) are affected.  This includes
upstream Linux versions 2.6.37 and later.  Systems using the older
classic-linux fork are not affected.

All PV x86 domains doing block IO on behalf of a guest, including dom0
and any PV driver domains, are vulnerable.  (Any HVM driver domains
running are not vulnerable.)  This includes Xen vbd backends such as
blkback, but also direct IO performed for the guest via eg qemu.

ARM systems are not affected.

The vulnerability is only exposed if the underlying block device has
request merging enabled.  See Mitigation.

The vulnerability is only exposed to configurations which use grant
mapping as a transport mechanism for the block data.  Configurations
which use exclusively grant copy are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Disable bio merges on all relevant underlying backend block devices.
For example,
  echo 2 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan H. Schönherr of Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

$

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1477656#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-02 14:43:09 UTC  ``` ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The block layer in Linux may choose to merge adjacent block IO requests. When Linux is running as a Xen guest, the default merging algorithm is replaced with a Xen-specific one.  When Linux is running as an x86 PV guest, some BIO's are erroneously merged, corrupting the data stream to/from the block device.  This can result in incorrect access to an uncontrolled adjacent frame.  IMPACT ======  A buggy or malicious guest can cause Linux to read or write incorrect memory when processing a block stream.  This could leak information from other guests in the system or from Xen itself, or be used to DoS or escalate privilege within the system.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All x86 Xen systems using pvops Linux in a backend role (either as dom0, or as a disk device driver domain) are affected.  This includes upstream Linux versions 2.6.37 and later.  Systems using the older classic-linux fork are not affected.  All PV x86 domains doing block IO on behalf of a guest, including dom0 and any PV driver domains, are vulnerable.  (Any HVM driver domains running are not vulnerable.)  This includes Xen vbd backends such as blkback, but also direct IO performed for the guest via eg qemu.  ARM systems are not affected.  The vulnerability is only exposed if the underlying block device has request merging enabled.  See Mitigation.  The vulnerability is only exposed to configurations which use grant mapping as a transport mechanism for the block data.  Configurations which use exclusively grant copy are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  Disable bio merges on all relevant underlying backend block devices. For example, echo 2 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges  External References:  <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-229.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1477656#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-15 12:33:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Xen project Upstream: Jan H.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3655-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added mitigations in the Linux

kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding

updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

14.04 LTS for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Jan H. Schönherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle

block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm

could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2017-12134](/security/CVE-2017-12134))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-13220](/security/CVE-2017-13220))

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device

driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18079](/security/CVE-2017-18079))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18221](/security/CVE-2017-18221))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.149.140](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-149.199~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.149.140](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-149.199~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-149.199~precise1)

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact

the cloud provider to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated

to expose the new CPU features to virtual machines.

 IO merge-ability calculation

Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2017-12134 / XSA-229
                               version 3

            linux: Fix Xen block IO merge-ability calculation

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The block layer in Linux may choose to merge adjacent block IO requests.
When Linux is running as a Xen guest, the default merging algorithm is
replaced with a Xen-specific one.  When Linux is running as an x86 PV
guest, some BIO's are erroneously merged, corrupting the data stream
to/from the block device.

This can result in incorrect access to an uncontrolled adjacent frame.

IMPACT
======

A buggy or malicious guest can cause Linux to read or write incorrect
memory when processing a block stream.  This could leak information from
other guests in the system or from Xen itself, or be used to DoS or
escalate privilege within the system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All x86 Xen systems using pvops Linux in a backend role (either as
dom0, or as a disk device driver domain) are affected.  This includes
upstream Linux versions 2.6.37 and later.  Systems using the older
classic-linux fork are not affected.

All PV x86 domains doing block IO on behalf of a guest, including dom0
and any PV driver domains, are vulnerable.  (Any HVM driver domains
running are not vulnerable.)  This includes Xen vbd backends such as
blkback, but also direct IO performed for the guest via eg qemu.

ARM systems are not affected.

The vulnerability is only exposed if the underlying block device has
request merging enabled.  See Mitigation.

The vulnerability is only exposed to configurations which use grant
mapping as a transport mechanism for the block data.  Configurations
which use exclusively grant copy are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Disable bio merges on all relevant underlying backend block devices.
For example,
  echo 2 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan H. Schönherr of Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

xsa229.patch           Linux

$ sha256sum xsa229*
5f96c72c8c5a971d52f5540475a3fc6f4fef2071ec772ef21392fdc238eda858  xsa229.patch
$

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

                 CVE-2017-1000380
Debian Bug     : 866511 875881

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-7518

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that KVM is prone to an incorrect debug
    exception (#DB) error occurring while emulating a syscall
    instruction. A process inside a guest can take advantage of this
    flaw for privilege escalation inside a guest.

CVE-2017-7558 (stretch only)

    Stefano Brivio of Red Hat discovered that the SCTP subsystem is
    prone to a data leak vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read
    flaw, allowing to leak up to 100 uninitialized bytes to userspace.

CVE-2017-10661 (jessie only)

    Dmitry Vyukov of Google reported that the timerfd facility does
    not properly handle certain concurrent operations on a single file
    descriptor.  This allows a local attacker to cause a denial of
    service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-11600

    Bo Zhang reported that the xfrm subsystem does not properly
    validate one of the parameters to a netlink message. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this to cause a denial
    of service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-12134 / #866511 / XSA-229

    Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon discovered that when Linux is running
    in a Xen PV domain on an x86 system, it may incorrectly merge
    block I/O requests.  A buggy or malicious guest may trigger this
    bug in dom0 or a PV driver domain, causing a denial of service or
    potentially execution of arbitrary code.

    This issue can be mitigated by disabling merges on the underlying
    back-end block devices, e.g.:
        echo 2 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges

CVE-2017-12146 (stretch only)

    Adrian Salido of Google reported a race condition in access to the
    "driver_override" attribute for platform devices in sysfs. If
    unprivileged users are permitted to access this attribute, this
    might allow them to gain privileges.

CVE-2017-12153

    bo Zhang reported that the cfg80211 (wifi) subsystem does not
    properly validate the parameters to a netlink message. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace with a
    wifi device) can use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-12154

    Jim Mattson of Google reported that the KVM implementation for
    Intel x86 processors did not correctly handle certain nested
    hypervisor configurations. A malicious guest (or nested guest in a
    suitable L1 hypervisor) could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-14106

    Andrey Konovalov discovered that a user-triggerable division by
    zero in the tcp_disconnect() function could result in local denial
    of service.

CVE-2017-14140

    Otto Ebeling reported that the move_pages() system call performed
    insufficient validation of the UIDs of the calling and target
    processes, resulting in a partial ASLR bypass. This made it easier
    for local users to exploit vulnerabilities in programs installed
    with the set-UID permission bit set.

CVE-2017-14156

    "sohu0106" reported an information leak in the atyfb video driver.
    A local user with access to a framebuffer device handled by this
    driver could use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2017-14340

    Richard Wareing discovered that the XFS implementation allows the
    creation of files with the "realtime" flag on a filesystem with no
    realtime device, which can result in a crash (oops). A local user
    with access to an XFS filesystem that does not have a realtime
    device can use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-14489

    ChunYu Wang of Red Hat discovered that the iSCSI subsystem does not
    properly validate the length of a netlink message, leading to
    memory corruption. A local user with permission to manage iSCSI
    devices can use this for denial of service or possibly to execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-14497 (stretch only)

    Benjamin Poirier of SUSE reported that vnet headers are not
    properly handled within the tpacket_rcv() function in the raw
    packet (af_packet) feature. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW
    capability can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service (buffer overflow, and disk and memory corruption) or have
    other impact.

CVE-2017-1000111

    Andrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition in the raw
    packet (af_packet) feature. Local users with the CAP_NET_RAW
    capability can use this for denial of service or possibly to
    execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000112

    Andrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition flaw in the
    UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) code. A local user can use this
    flaw for denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000251 / #875881

    Armis Labs discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem does not
    properly validate L2CAP configuration responses, leading to a
    stack buffer overflow. This is one of several vulnerabilities
    dubbed "Blueborne". A nearby attacker can use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code on a
    system with Bluetooth enabled.

CVE-2017-1000252 (stretch only)

    Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon reported that the KVM implementation
    for Intel x86 processors did not correctly validate interrupt
    injection requests. A local user with permission to use KVM could
    use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-1000370

    The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument or
    environment list can result in ASLR bypass for 32-bit PIE binaries.

CVE-2017-1000371

    The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument
    orenvironment list can result in a stack/heap clash for 32-bit
    PIE binaries.

CVE-2017-1000380

    Alexander Potapenko of Google reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) timer driver, leading to an information leak. A local user
    with permission to access sound devices could use this to obtain
    sensitive information.

Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they
are enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl) then
CVE-2017-11600, CVE-2017-14497 and CVE-2017-1000111 can be exploited
by any local user.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u5.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
