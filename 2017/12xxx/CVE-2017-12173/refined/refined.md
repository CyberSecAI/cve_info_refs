  "CVE-2017-12173": {
    "description": "The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) service stores cached data in an LDAP-like local database file using libldb. To lookup cached data LDAP search filters like '(objectClass=user)(name=user_name)' are used. However, in sysdb_search_user_by_upn_res(), the input is not sanitized and allows to manipulate the search filter for cache lookups. This would allow a logged in user to discover the password hash of a different user. The password hash would be cached after a successful authentication of the corresponding user.",
    "vulnerability": "Unsanitized input in sssd's sysdb_search_user_by_upn_res() when querying local cache.",
    "impact": "A logged-in user can discover the password hash of a different user if the password hash was previously locally cached.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access by an authenticated user.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be an authenticated user on the local system."
