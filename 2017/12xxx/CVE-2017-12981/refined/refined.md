Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12981:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw.
*   The `$_POST['sort']` parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input validation or sanitization of the `$_POST['sort']` parameter before including it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration: Accessing and stealing sensitive information from the database.
    *   Data modification: Modifying or deleting database records.
    *   Complete system takeover: In some cases, gaining control of the underlying operating system via database functions.
    *  Information disclosure: The provided exploit uses `updatexml` to extract the database name.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via an HTTP POST request to the `forummanage.php` script.
*   **Manipulated `sort` parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `sort` parameter of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `forummanage.php` script.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** To craft the injection payload, the attacker must have some understanding of SQL syntax.
*   **No authentication required**: The code snippet does not show any authentication checks before the SQL query, implying that the vulnerability could be triggered by an unauthenticated user.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `/nexusphp.v1.5.beta5.20120707/forummanage.php` at line 63.
*   The provided exploit uses `updatexml` to extract the database name demonstrating information disclosure.
