Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Summary**
The provided text describes multiple vulnerabilities in libgig version 4.0.0, a C++ library used for handling various audio sampler file formats. All vulnerabilities are triggered by crafting malicious .gig files, leading to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions by crashing the application.

**Vulnerabilities**

1.  **CVE-2017-12950: Null Pointer Dereference in `gig::Region::Region`**
    *   **Root Cause:** A crafted GIG file can cause a null pointer dereference when accessing `file->pWavePoolTable` within the `gig::Region::Region` function.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper handling of potentially null `pWavePoolTable` pointer.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash leading to denial of service.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Processing a crafted GIG file using `gigdump` tool.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious GIG file.

2.  **CVE-2017-12951: Stack Buffer Overflow in `gig::DimensionRegion::CreateVelocityTable`**
    *   **Root Cause:** A crafted GIG file leads to a stack buffer overflow in the `gig::DimensionRegion::CreateVelocityTable` function, specifically when writing to the `table` array.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when creating the velocity table, causing the write operation to go beyond the allocated stack memory for the `table`.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash due to memory corruption, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Processing a crafted GIG file using `gigdump`.
     *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious GIG file.

3.  **CVE-2017-12952: Null Pointer Dereference in `LoadString` (helper.h)**
    *   **Root Cause:** A crafted GIG file triggers a null pointer dereference within the `LoadString` function in `helper.h`, specifically when trying to access `str[len]`. This happens in the context of loading DLS information.
    *   **Weakness:** The `LoadString` function doesn't handle the case where it receives a null or invalid string pointer, causing a crash when trying to access its content.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, leading to denial of service.
     *   **Attack Vector:** Processing a crafted GIG file using `gigdump`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious GIG file.

4. **CVE-2017-12953: Invalid Memory Write in `gig::Instrument::UpdateRegionKeyTable`**
    *   **Root Cause:** A crafted GIG file causes an invalid memory write within `gig::Instrument::UpdateRegionKeyTable`, resulting in memory corruption and application crash. The vulnerability occurs when writing to the `RegionKeyTable` array, exceeding bounds.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of bounds checking before writing to the `RegionKeyTable` array.
    *  **Impact:** Application crash due to an invalid memory write, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Processing a crafted GIG file using `gigdump`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious GIG file.

5.  **CVE-2017-12954: Invalid Memory Read in `gig::Region::GetSampleFromWavePool`**
    *   **Root Cause:** A crafted GIG file can cause an invalid memory read in the `gig::Region::GetSampleFromWavePool` function, when accessing `file->pWavePoolTable[WavePoolTableIndex]`.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation of the `WavePoolTableIndex` before accessing the `pWavePoolTable`.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash due to accessing invalid memory, leading to a denial of service.
   *   **Attack Vector:** Processing a crafted GIG file using `gigdump`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft a malicious GIG file.

**Commonalities**
* **Affected Version:** libgig 4.0.0
* **Attack Vector:** All vulnerabilities are triggered by processing a crafted `.gig` file using the `gigdump` tool.
* **Impact:** Denial of service due to application crash.
* **Attacker Requirement:** Ability to craft malicious GIG files.
