Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Relates to CVE:** No. The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Appointment" component of Joomla, but does not correspond to CVE-2017-12758.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Joomla "Appointment" component, specifically in the `ser_id` and `emp_id` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries. The component is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `ser_id` and `emp_id` parameters within the "service-list" view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially:
    *   Retrieve sensitive information from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain further access to the system, depending on the database user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request Parameters:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending malicious SQL code through the `ser_id` and `emp_id` parameters in the URL when accessing the `/index.php/service-list` page of the Joomla application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla application. This indicates a remote attack scenario, and no special authentication is noted as a requirement for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Technical Details (from exploit-db.com):**

*   The exploit targets the Joomla component "Appointment" version 1.1.
*   Specific vulnerable parameters are `ser_id` and `emp_id`.
*   The proof of concept includes example URLs:
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php/service-list?view=allorder&ser_id=[SQL]`
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php/service-list?view=allorder&emp_id=[SQL]`
*   An example of a SQL injection payload is provided:
    *   `-84+/*!11111union*/+/*!11111select*/+(sELECT+eXPORT_sET(0x35,@:=0,(sELECT+cOUNT(*)fROM(iNFORMATiON_sCHEMA.cOLUMNS)wHERE@:=eXPORT_sET(0x35,eXPORT_sET(0x35,@,tABLE_nAME,0x3c6c693e,2),cOLUMN_nAME,0xa3a,2)),@,0x32))--+-`
