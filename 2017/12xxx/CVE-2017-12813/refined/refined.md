- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the comments section.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution (likely in the context of the victim's browser session)
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can post a comment containing an XSS payload. When other users view the file and its comments, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to post comments to the file sharing script.
