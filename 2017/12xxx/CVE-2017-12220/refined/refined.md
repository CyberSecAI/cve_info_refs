Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center. Specifically, the interface doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, which enables the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means that malicious scripts are injected into a request and then reflected back to the user, executing in the context of the user's browser. The vulnerability falls under CWE-79.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Execution of Arbitrary Scripts:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
* **Compromise of User Accounts:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
* **Defacement:** An attacker might modify the displayed content of the vulnerable application.
* **Redirection:** The user may be redirected to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely, targeting a user of the web interface.
* **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to interact with a crafted malicious link/request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication to the vulnerable system.
* **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link or visit a crafted URL, thus triggering the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS v3 score of 6.1 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
