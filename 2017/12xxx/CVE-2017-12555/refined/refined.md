Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-12555:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal flaw in the `fileDownload` endpoint of the HPE Intelligent Management Center (iMC) Service Operation Management (SOM) Software Module. Although HPE attempted to patch a previous vulnerability (CVE-2017-5797) by adding authentication and file download restrictions, the patch failed to address path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided file paths, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directories and access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `filePath` parameter is vulnerable to path traversal sequences such as `../`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An authenticated attacker can download any file from the server that the application user has permissions to access. This can expose sensitive data, configuration files, or other critical information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `fileDownload` endpoint with a manipulated `filePath` parameter.
- **URL Manipulation:** Specifically, modifying the `filePath` parameter within the URL to include path traversal sequences. Example: `filePath=c2VydmljZWRlc2tcV0VCLUlORlxwcm9jZXNzXC4uXC4uXC4uXC4uXC4uXC4uXC4uXC4uXC4uXC4uXC4uXFdpbmRvd3Ncd2luLmluaQ==` which is the base64 encoded version of `servicedesk\WEB-INF\process\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Windows\win.ini`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to access the `fileDownload` endpoint.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable iMC server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous patch for CVE-2017-5797.
- Tenable's analysis indicates that HPE incorrectly assessed the severity of this vulnerability, giving it a higher CVSS score by considering it unauthenticated and capable of file modification. Tenable scores it lower as authentication is required and no file modification is possible.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSSv2 base score of 6.8 and a CVSSv3 base score of 6.5.
- The affected product is HPE iMC Service Operation Management (SOM) Software Module 7.3 E0501.
- The fix is to upgrade to iMC SOM Software Module 7.3 E0501P01.
