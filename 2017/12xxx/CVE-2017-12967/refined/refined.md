Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect check in the `getsym` function within the `tekhex.c` file of the Binutils library. This function is responsible for parsing tekhex binary files. Specifically, the check for a source pointer walking off the end of the input buffer was flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stack buffer overflow:** When parsing a malformed tekhex file, the `getsym` function could read beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, causing a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the `objdump` tool due to the stack buffer overflow, causing a denial of service. This can occur when a user attempts to analyze a specially crafted tekhex binary file.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious file:** An attacker can create a specially crafted tekhex file designed to trigger the stack buffer overflow in the `getsym` function when processed by `objdump` or other tools that use the affected binutils library.
- **File analysis:** The vulnerability can be exploited by enticing a user to analyze a malicious tekhex file using a vulnerable version of `binutils`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted tekhex file to the target user.
- The target system must use a vulnerable version of the binutils library.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found in `binutils-2.29`, specifically in the `bfd/tekhex.c` file.
- The issue was identified with the help of AddressSanitizer output that detected the stack buffer overflow.
- The fix for the vulnerability was a simple check to ensure the source pointer does not walk off the end of the input buffer.
- Patches were applied to both the master branch and the 2.29 branch of the binutils repository.
