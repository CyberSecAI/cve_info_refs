- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Moxa EDR-810 web server uses a weak cryptographic method (MD5 hash) to store and transmit user passwords after initial login. This hash is not salted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak cryptography for passwords. The use of unsalted MD5 hashes makes it easy to crack the passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can intercept the weakly encrypted password hash, crack it, and obtain the device's password, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: By intercepting HTTP requests containing the password hash in the `PASSWORD` parameter within the Cookie header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment to intercept the HTTP request. No special privileges required since login credentials would have been obtained by the user.
