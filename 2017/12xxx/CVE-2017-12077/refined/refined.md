- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption in SYNO.Core.PortForwarding.Rules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the SYNO.Core.PortForwarding.Rules component of Synology Router Manager (SRM), which allows for uncontrolled resource consumption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can exhaust the memory resources of the machine, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Synology Router Manager (SRM).
