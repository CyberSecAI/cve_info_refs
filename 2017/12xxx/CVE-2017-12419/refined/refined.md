{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the combination of two factors: the presence of the `admin` directory after installation and the MySQL client's `local_infile` setting enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `install.php` script within the `admin` directory remains accessible after a successful installation, which is a security risk.",
      "The application allows the use of  `mysqli` driver which  can be configured to enable `local_infile`, which allows for reading local files if a rogue MySQL server is used."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to remotely read arbitrary files on the MantisBT server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the `install.php` script, controlling the `hostname` parameter to point to a rogue MySQL server.",
      "The rogue MySQL server uses the 'connect file read' feature to request specific files on the MantisBT server."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MantisBT server.",
      "The attacker needs to set up and control a rogue MySQL server.",
      "The attacker needs the target MantisBT instance to have `mysqli.allow_local_infile` enabled in php.ini or the MySQL client config."
    ],
     "additional_information": [
        "The vulnerability affects all MantisBT versions 1.x and 2.x.",
        "There is no code patch for this vulnerability; the advised mitigation steps include removing the `admin` directory and disabling `mysqli.allow_local_infile`."
