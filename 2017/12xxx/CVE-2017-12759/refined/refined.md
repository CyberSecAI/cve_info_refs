Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically in the parameters `id`, `student_id`, `fee_id`, and `session_id`, `invoice` within the following PHP files:
    *   `drivers/jquery/usersession_exam.php`
    *   `drivers/jquery/session_exam.php`
    *   `Assignment.php`
    *   `Fee.php`
    *   `YearBook.php`
    *  `Transaction.php`
    *  Potentially other endpoints within the application

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other application data.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation**: If the database user has sufficient permissions, the attacker could potentially gain further access to the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable through manipulating the query string parameters in HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to send HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to have a working knowledge of SQL injection techniques in order to craft malicious payloads.

**Exploit Examples:**
The provided content includes example SQL injection payloads. Examples include:
   *  `1'+/*!44444union*/+/*!44444select*/+1,2,(sELECT+eXPORT_sET(0x35,@:=0,(sELECT+cOUNT(*)fROM(iNFORMATiON_sCHEMA.cOLUMNS)wHERE@:=eXPORT_sET(0x35,eXPORT_sET(0x35,@,tABLE_nAME,0x3c6c693e,2),cOLUMN_nAME,0xa3a,2)),@,0x32)),4,5--+-` - This payload is intended to extract column names from the database
    *   `1'+/*!44444union*/+/*!44444select*/+1,2,concat(username,0x3a,password),4,5+from+users--+-` - This payload is intended to extract usernames and passwords from the users table.
   * `7'and+(select+0x31+from (select+count(*),concat((select(select concat(cast(database() as char),0x7e))+from information_schema.tables+where table_schema=database()+limit 0,1),floor(rand(0)*2))x from+information_schema.tables+group+by+x)a)+AND ''='` - This payload is intended to extract the database name.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content is from Exploit Database and is not the official CVE description.
*   The exploit examples and vulnerable endpoints are specific and provide more detail than a typical CVE description.
*   The lack of proper input sanitization is a common web application vulnerability and is easily exploited by attackers with the required knowledge.
