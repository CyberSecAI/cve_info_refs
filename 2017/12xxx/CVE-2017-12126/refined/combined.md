# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2017-0478

## Moxa EDR-810 Web Server Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability

##### April 13, 2018

##### CVE Number

CVE-2017-12126

### Summary

An exploitable cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in the web server functionality of Moxa EDR-810 V4.1 build 17030317. A specially crafted HTTP packet can cause cross-site request forgery. An attacker can create malicious HTML to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Moxa EDR-810 V4.1 build 17030317

### Product URLs

<https://www.moxa.com/product/EDR-810.htm>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Details

In order to trigger the CSRF a logged in user needs to visit a page with malicious code on it. The malicious code will be able to do anything the logged in user can do. For example the malicious code could add a user, modify firewall rules, etc. This could also be chained with a command injection to get a root shell on the device. This problem is compounded by the fact that users cannot log out of the device, meaning that a user’s session will remain valid long after they’ve stopped interacting with the device.
