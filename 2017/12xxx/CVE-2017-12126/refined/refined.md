- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Moxa EDR-810 web server is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The web application does not properly validate the origin of requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), lack of user logout functionality compounds the issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform any action the logged-in user can perform, such as adding a new user, modifying firewall rules, or potentially chaining this with a command injection to gain a root shell on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts malicious HTML which, when visited by a logged-in user, triggers an unintended action on the Moxa device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a logged-in user to visit a page with malicious HTML. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the Moxa device, only that the victim is logged into the web interface of the device.
