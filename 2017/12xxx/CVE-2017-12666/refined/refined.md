The provided content relates to CVE-2017-12666.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `WriteINLINEImage` function within the `inline.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unfreed memory allocated for `ImageInfo` structure

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory leak, potentially leading to denial of service if the vulnerability is repeatedly triggered

**Attack Vectors:**
- Converting an image to the `inline` format using the `magick` command-line tool with a specially crafted input file
- Specifically, the issue arises when an `ImageTypeNotSupported` error is thrown within the `WriteINLINEImage` function, causing allocated memory to leak due to the use of `ThrowWriterException` prior to calling `DestroyImageInfo`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to supply an image file to be converted
- Ability to execute the `magick` tool with specified command line arguments
