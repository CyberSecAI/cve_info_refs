Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2017-12699: Incorrect Default Permissions**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions assigned to application files within AzeoTech's DAQFactory software.
*   **Weakness:** Local, non-administrative users can modify or replace original application files with malicious ones due to insufficient access controls.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows a local, non-administrative user to escalate privileges by replacing legitimate application files with malicious ones, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Requires local access to the system where DAQFactory is installed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have user-level privileges on the system.

**CVE-2017-5147: Uncontrolled Search Path Element**

*   **Root Cause:** The software does not restrict the locations from which it loads DLL files.
*   **Weakness:** The software is vulnerable to DLL hijacking attacks, where a malicious DLL is placed in the search path and loaded instead of the intended one.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location that DAQFactory searches.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Requires local access to the system where DAQFactory is installed and the ability to place files in the system's DLL search path.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have user-level privileges on the system and to trick a user into triggering the execution path.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory states that both vulnerabilities are not remotely exploitable.
*   The advisory mentions that the newer version (17.1) of DAQFactory resolves these issues by restricting write access to administrators and by not searching for DLLs outside the application directory.
