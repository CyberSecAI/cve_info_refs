{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `delreport` parameter before using it in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In a specific scenario where the database user has root privileges, the attacker could potentially write malicious files to the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `takeupdate.php` with a crafted `delreport` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. The exploit requires staff privileges."
