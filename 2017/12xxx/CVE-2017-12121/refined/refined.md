- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server of the Moxa EDR-810 device does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `rsakey_name` parameter when generating an RSA key. This allows for OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The application executes user-controlled input as an OS command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the device, potentially leading to full system compromise. The example given in the proof of concept starts a reverse shell, which would allow remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/net_WebRSAKEYGen` URI, targeting the `rsakey_name` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged in to the device's web interface to be able to send the malicious request.
