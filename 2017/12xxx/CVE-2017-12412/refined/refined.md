Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12412:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `ccn-lite-ccnb2xml` utility within the CCN-lite software. Specifically, it is triggered by a crafted file that causes infinite recursion during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Infinite recursion: The program enters an infinite recursive loop when processing a specially crafted file.
- Stack overflow: Due to the infinite recursion, the program eventually exceeds the stack limit, causing a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a denial of service as the stack overflow leads to program termination and prevents the utility from functioning correctly.
- Potential for other impacts: While the direct impact is a DoS, the high confidentiality, integrity and availability scores from CVSS indicate other potential negative impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted file: The attack vector is a maliciously crafted file that is passed as input to the vulnerable `ccn-lite-ccnb2xml` utility.
- Local: The attack vector is local because the attacker needs to provide the crafted file directly to the vulnerable binary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted file as input to `ccn-lite-ccnb2xml`.
- User interaction is required, as the user must execute the utility with the malicious file.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in CCN-lite versions prior to 2.0.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Eric Sesterhenn from X41 D-SEC GmbH.
- The issue was tracked internally as issue #128 in the `cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite` repository.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-835, which indicates a problem related to infinite loops.
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.8, indicating a high severity.
