Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12099:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `customData_add_layer__internal` function within Blender. This occurs when the size of a custom data layer is calculated by multiplying the number of elements by the size of each element. A large enough number of elements can cause this multiplication to overflow, resulting in a smaller-than-expected allocation size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation or handling of the multiplication result in `customData_add_layer__internal`. This leads to a size calculation that wraps around due to integer overflow.
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The undersized allocation is then used in subsequent memory operations. When the data from the deprecated `tface` is copied over, it overflows the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the heap buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent heap metadata, potentially corrupting other data and leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Blender application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious .blend Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious `.blend` file that contains a Mesh object with a large `totface` value, which, during the versioning process, will trigger the integer overflow when the deprecated tface attribute is being handled..
- **Library Use:** An attacker could also embed a malicious object inside a library and convince a user to load the library in a blender project.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **File Creation/Modification:** The attacker must be able to create or modify a `.blend` file with a crafted Mesh object.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious `.blend` file or load the compromised library within Blender.

**Additional Details:**

- **Specific Function:** The vulnerability occurs in the `customData_add_layer__internal` function, called via the `CustomData_add_layer` function in `blenkernel/intern/customdata.c`.
- **Affected Versions:** Blender v2.78c was specifically tested and found to be vulnerable.
- **Exploit Proof of Concept:**  A python script is mentioned as a proof of concept, creating malicious `.blend` files.
- **CVSS Score:** A CVSS v3 score of 8.8 is given, indicating a high severity.

In short, the vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious `.blend` file that triggers an integer overflow during legacy data conversion, leading to a heap buffer overflow and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution when the user opens the file within Blender.
