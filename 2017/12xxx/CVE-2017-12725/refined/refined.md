- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Medfusion 4000 Wireless Syringe Infusion Pump uses hard-coded credentials to automatically establish a wireless network connection when the default network configuration is used.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and impact the intended operation of the pump. Specifically, an attacker could potentially compromise the communications module and the therapeutic module of the pump.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation through a wireless network connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be within range of the pump's wireless network and have knowledge of the hard-coded credentials. The attacker does not require any privileges on the pump prior to exploitation.
