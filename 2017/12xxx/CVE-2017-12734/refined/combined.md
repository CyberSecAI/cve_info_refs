//support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/109741041)

• Apply cell protection concept (see https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-

security)

• Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells

• Apply Defense-in-Depth (see http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/industrial-security/

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siemens LOGO! BM (Base Module) devices are used for basic small-scale automation tasks.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-12734

An attacker with network access to the integrated web server on port 80/tcp could obtain the session
ID of an active user session. A user must be logged in to the web interface. Siemens recommends to
use the integrated webserver on port 80/tcp only in trusted networks.
