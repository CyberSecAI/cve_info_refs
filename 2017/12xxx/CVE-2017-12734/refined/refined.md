- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an issue in the integrated web server of Siemens LOGO!8 BM devices, specifically how it handles user session IDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Leak. An attacker with network access can obtain the session ID of an active user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can hijack existing web sessions. The vulnerability allows for unauthorized access and control of the web interface.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker needs network access to the web server of the LOGO! device, typically on port 80/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device and must exploit the vulnerability while a user is logged into the web interface.
