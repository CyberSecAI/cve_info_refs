      "The communication channel is accessible by non-endpoints, which allows for potential decryption and modification of network traffic."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can decrypt and modify network traffic, potentially leading to unauthorized control or data manipulation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-Middle attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack between the LOGO! BM device and other communicating devices."
