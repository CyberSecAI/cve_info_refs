Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in multiple vulnerabilities within the OpenCV library when processing image files, specifically when using the `cv::imread` function.  These vulnerabilities include issues in the BMP decoder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** When reading malformed BMP images, an out-of-bounds write error occurs in the `FillColorRow4` function.
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs, leading to an invalid write during the BMP header reading process, specifically in the `cv::RLByteStream::getBytes` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerabilities can cause segmentation faults and crashes due to memory corruption, leading to a denial of service.
*  **Potential arbitrary code execution**: Memory corruption issues could potentially be leveraged for more serious attacks depending on the context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image Files:** The primary attack vector involves processing specially crafted or malformed image files (e.g., BMP files) using the `cv::imread` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the image files that are processed by an application using the vulnerable OpenCV library.

**Additional Details:**

* The identified vulnerabilities were found in OpenCV versions 3.3 and potentially also affect earlier 2.x releases.
* The issue was reported with specific Valgrind outputs showing invalid memory accesses and crashes during the BMP decoding process.
*  Specific test cases that trigger the vulnerabilities have been provided and located in this repository: `https://github.com/xiaoqx/pocs/tree/master/opencv`.
