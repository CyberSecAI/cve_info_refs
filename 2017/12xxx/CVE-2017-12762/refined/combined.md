## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3620-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel

attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715))

It was discovered that the netlink 802.11 configuration interface in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from

userspace. A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privilege could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-11089](/security/CVE-2017-11089))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ioctl handling code

in the ISDN subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-12762](/security/CVE-2017-12762))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a

task's default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-144-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-144.193~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.144.135](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-144-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-144.193~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.144.135](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

This isn't correct.  There is a 'count' variable that decrements to zero, yes,
but that's not what is used to index the strings.  'res' is used for that, and
it increments from zero as you'd expect.

Regarding OOB, there is the read-by-word trickery, but it's safe and won't
trip up KASAN for the max 7 bytes it can end up reading past bounds, and won't
in any instance cross a page boundary.

Since 'param' is guaranteed to be NUL-terminated from the fix (the isdn_common.c
change), so is 'p', so the strscpy is fine here, especially since the later
use of the buffer (coming from the netdev netname) uses strlen as the length
for the buffer copy to userland here:
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_common.c?id=9f5af546e6acc30f075828cb58c7f09665033967#n1385>
So strscpy_pad() wasn't necessary in this instance, despite it often being
needed for kernel work (and the better defensive choice, unless performance
is critical and you can guarantee the remaining part of the buffer never gets
copied to userland or used in any way).

This wasn't due to a revert, the fix was just never backported to 3.16.
Happens all the time.  There's never a guarantee that just because a
security fix is backported to some newer kernel version that it'll be
backported to all affected versions.  If the patch doesn't apply cleanly
and no one fixes it up, it just never gets fixed.

For this instance, you can confirm it by looking at the git log for that tree:
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/log/drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c?h=linux-3.16.y>

The 3.16 kernel has a different maintainer than others listed on kernel.org:
<https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html>
so there may be different critera for what's selected for backporting there.

Thanks,
-Brad

Subject: Potential regression and/or incomplete fix for CVE-2017-12762

Hello,
I stumbled upon CVE-2017-12762 which has a CVSS score of 10 and I think the
patch is incomplete and it might have regressed in the stable version. I am
probably wrong hence this email to see if anyone familiar with this CVE and
the fix and tell me if I am wrong.

## Incomplete patch
The patch can be found in
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9f5af546e6acc30f075828cb58c7f09665033967>

This is the vulnerable piece of code
```
char *
isdn_net_newslave(char *parm)
{
    char *p = strchr(parm, ',');
    isdn_net_dev *n;
    char newname[10];

    if (p) {
        /* Slave-Name MUST not be empty or overflow 'newname' */
        *if (strscpy(newname, p + 1, sizeof(newname)) <= 0)*
            return NULL;
        *p = 0;
        /* Master must already exist */
        if (!(n = isdn_net_findif(parm)))
            return NULL;
        /* Master must be a real interface, not a slave */
        if (n->local->master)
            return NULL;
        /* Master must not be started yet */
        if (isdn_net_device_started(n))
            return NULL;
        return (isdn_net_new(newname, n->dev));
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

I think it is incomplete and can lead to reading out of bound since it does
*not* check if the src buffer (p) in this case has 10 bytes at least. The
fix assumes p has 10 bytes and copies that into newname. The fix
uses strscpy (
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cc12071ff39060fc2e47c58b43e249fe0d0061ee/lib/string.c#L180>)
which
based on its code it starts copying from count and decrements to zero.
which in this case if param is a string similar to "aa,", then p will point
to the last byte of the string, strscpy will copy from p+1+sizeof(newname)
= p+1+10 -[to]-> p+1 which would allow reading 10 bytes after the buffer p

I do not know if param can end with "," or if there is any validation
checks that it does not end with "," hence this might not be a bug but only
bad practice.

## Regression
I looked quickly into latest version for the kernel v3.16.81 and it seems
that the patch was probably reverted as the code matches exactly to the
vulnerable version to the CVE (
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c?id=v3.16.81#n2646>
)
Not sure if the fix was reworked but wanted to surface that issue as well

Ibrahim
