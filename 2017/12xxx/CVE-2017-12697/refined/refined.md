The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12697.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper protection of the communication channel between the Shanghai OnStar iOS client and the server, which makes it susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint ('Man-in-the-Middle') (CWE-300): The application does not properly protect the communication channel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to intercept sensitive information exchanged between the client and the server. This can lead to the attacker gaining full control of the Shanghai OnStar iOS client, enabling remote vehicle command execution and the viewing or editing of account data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker can intercept the communication between the iOS client and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept the communication between the client and the server. User interaction is required as the user must connect to the server.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate network traffic.
