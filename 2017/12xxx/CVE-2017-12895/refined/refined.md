  "CVE-2017-12895": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple Sources",
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The ICMP parser in tcpdump has a buffer over-read in print-icmp.c:icmp_print(). This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling ICMP extension headers, specifically when processing the checksum.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer Over-Read"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
          "Network"
      ],
     "Required Capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted ICMP packet with a malformed extension header."
     ]
    }
  }
}
