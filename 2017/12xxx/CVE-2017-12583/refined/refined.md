The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12583.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of the `at` field in the `msg` error message within the `doku.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The main weakness is the presence of a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application takes user-supplied input from the `at` parameter and directly embeds it into an error message without proper encoding, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the error message which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie stealing, redirection to malicious websites, and defacement, among other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `at` query parameter in the `doku.php` URL. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with the `at` parameter containing the malicious JavaScript code and trick users to open the link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript in the `at` parameter. The attacker doesn't need access to the server or the victim's machine, only the ability to lure the victim to open the crafted malicious URL.
