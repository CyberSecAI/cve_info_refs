#### Description

We want the ability to configure whether or not jelly files can be declared such that the doctype definition at the beginning of the XML can call out to external entities under the parsing by SAX in the xerces project.

The suggested fix is to add

```
if (!allowDtdToCallExternalEntities) {
    reader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
    reader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
    reader.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
}

```
