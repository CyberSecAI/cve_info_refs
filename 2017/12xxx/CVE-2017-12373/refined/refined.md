Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12373:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack in the TLS protocol implementation of affected Cisco products, specifically for cipher suites relying on RSA for key exchange.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Vulnerable to a variation of the classic Bleichenbacher attack against RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption.
- The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of TLS messages, causing the affected device to act as an oracle.
- This oracle allows the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.
- Affected products with 2048 bit RSA keys are particularly vulnerable

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker could access sensitive information.
- The attacker can recover the plaintext for a given TLS session by crafting specific TLS messages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack via crafted TLS messages.
- The attacker exploits a side-channel leak through the device's response to malformed TLS messages

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges.
- They need to be able to send crafted TLS messages to the vulnerable device.
- They need to be able to observe and interpret the server's responses to these messages.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities stemming from the "Return of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat" research paper.
- The vulnerability affects specific legacy Cisco ASA 5500 series devices, but it is not limited to those alone.
- Mitigation involves disabling the use of TLS ciphers that rely on RSA for key exchange, however this may impact interoperability with older clients.
- This vulnerability is associated with CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
- The specific Cisco products affected include: Cisco ASA 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540, and 5550
- The vulnerability was reported by Hanno BÃ¶ck, Juraj Somorovsky, Craig Young, and Dirk Wetter.
- A CVSS base score of 5.3 is associated with this vulnerability.
