| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 5.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 5.3 |

For reference, see the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/application-networking-services/ace-4700-series-application-control-engine-appliances/eol_C51-728944.html).   2 Cisco ACE30 Application Control Engine Module entered the end-of-life cycle on July 26, 2013. For reference, see the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/interfaces-modules/services-modules/eol_C51-728979.html).   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.         Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following products:         *Cisco Cloud Hosted Services*   + Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS)   + Cisco Spark   + Cisco Umbrella   *Network Application, Service, and Acceleration*   + Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS)   *Network and Content Security Devices*   + Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) - All models not listed in the Vulnerable Products section   + Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall Services   + Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA)   + Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)   + Cisco Firepower 2100 Series   + Cisco Firepower 4100 Series   + Cisco Firepower 7000 Series   + Cisco Firepower 8000 Series   + Cisco Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)   + Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)   *Routing and Switching - Enterprise and Service Provider*   + Cisco VPN Internal Service Module for ISR (VPN ISM)  Details  * Bleichenbacher's attack is an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack against RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption block formatting. Daniel Bleichenbacher originally performed this attack against the RSA key exchange on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Version 3.0.      The attack relies on the presence of a side channel indicating, for any chosen ciphertext, whether the corresponding plaintext has the correct format according to the RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 standard. An attacker could exploit this side channel as an oracle, iteratively constructing crafted TLS messages. Eventually the attacker might be able to recover the plaintext for a given TLS session.      The new research focused on identifying current TLS implementations affected by the classic Bleichenbacher attack or those affected by newly introduced variations. These new variations use the overall TCP connection state as a possible side channel and use a nonstandard, abbreviated TLS message flow.      The following vulnerabilities were identified based on this research:**Cavium SSL SDK Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of Cavium SSL Software Development Kits (SDKs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-17428.  **Legacy Cisco ASA 5500 Series Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of legacy Cisco ASA 5500 Series (ASA 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540, and 5550) devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.      This vulnerability affects the listed ASA models when they are using a 2048-bit RSA key.      This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-12373.  **SSL Visibility Bleichenbacher Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of Cisco SSL Appliance (Bluecoat SSL Visibility OEM appliance) could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures   against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for   key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending   crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and   allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack.  This vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-15533.  Workarounds  * Disabling use of TLS ciphers that rely on RSA for key exchange is a possible mitigation for these vulnerabilities. It is applicable only to products that support other types of ciphers, such as those based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This mitigation may have an impact on interoperability with legacy clients that do not support these ciphers. This mitigation is not applicable to Cisco Application Control Engine (ACE).      For potential workarounds on a specific Cisco product, refer to the relevant Cisco bug, which is available from the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID).  Fixed Software  * For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory. Questions concerning the WebEx environment can be directed to the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco TAC or their contracted maintenance providers.
