Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12940:

**Root Cause:**

The primary root cause lies in multiple vulnerabilities discovered in UnRAR, stemming from insufficient input validation and boundary checks during the processing of RAR archives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass UnRAR's directory traversal protections by using specially crafted symbolic links within the archive. This allows an attacker to write files outside of the intended extraction directory.
*   **Out-of-bounds Read (Archive::ReadHeader15 / EncodeFileName::Decode):**  The `EncodeFileName::Decode` function can read beyond the bounds of the `FileName` buffer if the `NameSize` is larger than the buffer's allocated size, due to a missing length check.
*   **Out-of-bounds Read (Unpack::Unpack20):** The `Unpack::Unpack20` function attempts to access an array out-of-bounds due to an unchecked index `DistNumber`.
*   **Buffer Overflow (Unpack::LongLZ):** The `Unpack::LongLZ` function accesses the `ChSetB` array with an out-of-bounds index `DistancePlace`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** Allows an attacker to write files outside the intended extraction directory leading to potential overwriting of existing files, arbitrary code execution, or privilege escalation.
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** Could lead to program crashes, denial of service (DoS), information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution if the data is controlled by the attacker.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Could lead to program crashes, denial of service (DoS), or potentially arbitrary code execution by overwriting memory and hijacking control flow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted RAR archive, which contains malicious symlinks and triggers the described vulnerabilities when processed by UnRAR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious RAR archive.
*   The attacker needs to entice a victim to open this malicious RAR file using the vulnerable version of UnRAR.
*   The attacker does not need local access but instead needs the victim to use the software to extract the file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes Proof-of-Concept (PoC) files for each vulnerability which were used for verifying the vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in UnRAR version 5.5.7 and RAR 5.5.0_p20170811.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA) classifies the severity as "normal" with remote exploitability, indicating the potential for significant impact.
