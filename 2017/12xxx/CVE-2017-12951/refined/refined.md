```
Root cause of vulnerability:
Multiple vulnerabilities are present in libgig version 4.0.0 due to improper handling of crafted gig files.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
1.  Null pointer dereference in `gig::Region::Region` function.
2.  Stack buffer overflow in `gig::DimensionRegion::CreateVelocityTable` function.
3.  Null pointer dereference in `LoadString` function.
4.  Invalid memory write in `gig::Instrument::UpdateRegionKeyTable` function.
5.  Invalid memory read in `gig::Region::GetSampleFromWavePool` function.

Impact of exploitation:
Denial of service due to application crashes.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerabilities are triggered by processing a specially crafted gig file using the `gigdump` utility.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted gig file to be processed by the vulnerable application.
