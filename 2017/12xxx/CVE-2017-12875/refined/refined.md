Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-12875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from "memory handling problems and cases of missing or incomplete input sanitizing" within ImageMagick. Specifically, it's related to how ImageMagick handles certain malformed image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Handling Issues:** The core of the problem lies in the way ImageMagick manages memory when processing image files. This suggests potential issues like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption flaws.
*   **Missing or Incomplete Input Sanitizing:** The vulnerability is also attributed to inadequate sanitization of input data. This implies that malformed data within image files isn't being correctly validated or handled before processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A primary impact is the possibility of a denial of service, where the application becomes unavailable due to resource exhaustion or crashes.
*   **Memory or CPU Exhaustion:** The vulnerability can lead to excessive memory consumption or CPU usage, which can cause performance issues or system instability.
*  **Information Disclosure:** There is a possibility of information disclosure.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In the most severe case, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the system, granting them full control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Image Files:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system using ImageMagick into opening a specially crafted, malformed image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** An attacker needs to provide the target system with a malicious image file. This could be via user upload, processing of a malicious file from the internet or other methods of file ingestion.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates this vulnerability affects multiple versions of ImageMagick across various operating systems, including Debian and Ubuntu.
*   The github issue link `#659` provided shows a case of a specific vulnerability that can lead to denial of service by exhausting the cpu in the WritePixelCachePixels function, which is a consequence of the memory issues described for CVE-2017-12875.
*   The ubuntu advisory lists a very large number of CVEs fixed in the same patch.
