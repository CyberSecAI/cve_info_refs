- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server crashes due to a null pointer dereference when processing HTTP requests if the first character of the URI is not a forward slash (/).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation (CWE-20). The web server fails to properly validate the HTTP URI, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted HTTP URI, crashing the web server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a URI that does not begin with a forward slash to the vulnerable web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the Moxa EDR-810 device to send the crafted HTTP request. No authentication is required.
