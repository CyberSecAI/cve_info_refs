Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Blender converts curves to polygons, specifically during the allocation of a `BevList` structure.
*   Integer overflow occurs during an arithmetic operation used to calculate the required buffer size for the `BevList`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The application multiplies values from a .blend file to determine the size of the allocation. A large enough value will cause this calculation to overflow, resulting in a smaller-than-expected allocation.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** When the application writes data into the undersized buffer, it overflows into adjacent memory on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** The heap overflow can be leveraged to overwrite data, including function pointers. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Blender application.
*   **Application Crash:** As demonstrated in the provided crash information, the overflow can lead to an access violation (crash) as the application attempts to write to an invalid memory location.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious .blend File:** An attacker crafts a malicious .blend file that contains specially formed curve data (specifically, `Nurb` structures) designed to trigger the integer overflow during `BevList` allocation.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to open the malicious .blend file in Blender, either by directly opening it, using it as a library (importing the curve object), or passing it as an argument to the Blender executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify .blend files.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the specially crafted file, which could involve tricking the user into thinking it's a legitimate file, or using other social engineering tactics.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `BKE_curve_bevelList_make` function, specifically during allocation for `BevList`. The code uses fields within the Nurb struct, such as `nu->pntsu`, `nu->resolu` and `segcount` to calculate the buffer size.
*   The vulnerability can occur when processing curves of types `CU_POLY`, `CU_BEZIER` and `CU_NURBS`.
*   The provided exploit proof of concept is a python script that can create malicious .blend files.
*   The vulnerability affects Blender v2.78c, but was also patched in Debian versions of Blender (2.79.b+dfsg0-1~deb9u1 and 2.72.b+dfsg0-3+deb8u1).
