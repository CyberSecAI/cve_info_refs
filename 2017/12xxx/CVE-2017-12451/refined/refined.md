The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12451.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `_bfd_xcoff_read_ar_hdr` function (and similar functions) within the `{coff,coff64}-rs6000.c` files. This occurs because the code uses `strtol` (or `strtoll`) on strings extracted from COFF archive headers which are not guaranteed to be null-terminated. These fields in the header are ASCII text strings left justified and padded with spaces, without null terminators, so `strtol` can read past the end of the buffer allocated for these fields on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: Reading beyond the bounds of a stack-allocated buffer due to lack of null termination.
- Use of potentially unsafe string conversion function: using `strtol` or `strtoll` on non null-terminated strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The stack-buffer-overflow allows for arbitrary code execution by overwriting stack contents or program termination by corrupting stack content.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted COFF archive files with malformed headers can trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious crafted file to a vulnerable program that will process the COFF archive file.
