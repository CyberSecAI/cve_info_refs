Abstract

We present practical poisoning and name-server block-
ing attacks on standard DNS resolvers, by off-path,
spooﬁng adversaries. Our attacks exploit large DNS
responses that cause IP fragmentation; such long re-
sponses are increasingly common, mainly due to the use
of DNSSEC.

In common scenarios, where DNSSEC is partially or
incorrectly deployed, our poisoning attacks allow ‘com-
plete’ domain hijacking. When DNSSEC is fully de-
ployed, attacker can force use of fake name server; we
show exploits of this allowing off-path trafﬁc analy-
sis and covert channel. When using NSEC3 opt-out,
attacker can also create fake subdomains, circumvent-
ing same origin restrictions. Our attacks circumvent
resolver-side defenses, e.g., port randomisation, IP ran-
domisation and query randomisation.

The (new) name server (NS) blocking attacks force re-
solver to use speciﬁc name server. This attack allows
Degradation of Service, trafﬁc-analysis and covert chan-
nel, and also facilitates DNS poisoning.

We validated the attacks using standard resolver soft-
ware and standard DNS name servers and zones, e.g.,
org.

Introduction

The correctness and availability of information in the Do-
main Name System are crucial for the operation of the
Internet.
In particular, DNS poisoning is a signiﬁcant
threat to Internet security, and can be used for phishing,
credentials stealing (e.g., XSS), sending spam and phish-
ing emails, eavesdropping, and more. Due to its wide
use and universal availability, the DNS is also abused in
other ways for different goals, including Denial of Ser-
vice, fast-ﬂux, covert botnet communication, and more.
Most DNS (poisoning and other) attacks ‘in the wild’,
as well as most research, considered an off-path adver-

1

sary that is able to send spoofed packets (but not to inter-
cept, modify or block packets). The most well known
is Kaminsky’s DNS poisoning attack [21], which was
exceedingly effective against many resolvers at the time
(2008). Kaminsky’s attack, and most other known DNS
poisoning attacks, allows the attacker to cause resolvers
to provide incorrect (poisoned) responses to DNS queries
of the clients, and thereby ‘hijack’ a domain name. We
refer to this type of attack as Domain-hijacking DNS poi-
soning, to distinguish between it and two other variants
of DNS poisoning, to which we also present off-path at-
tacks; more below (and see Table 1).

The increased awareness to the risks of DNS poison-
ing, following the publication of Kaminsky’s attack, was
one of the factors helping to speed-up the (long-overdue)
adoption of the DNSSEC standard [2–4]. DNSSEC uses
digital signatures to prevent poisoning of the DNS re-
sponses, and is hence secure even against man-in-the-
middle (MitM) adversaries. DNSSEC had a long and
thorough design and evaluation process, and its secu-
rity is based on extensive evaluation by many experts,
as well as on results of formal analysis, e.g., by Bau and
Mitchell [5]. (There are also alternate proposals for se-
curity against MitM, e.g., DNS Curve [7]).

However, deployment of DNSSEC is challenging and
would take considerable time. Hence, as a more im-
mediate response to Kaminsky’s attack, resolvers were
rapidly ‘patched’ to protect against it, mostly following
RFC5452 [19]. The ‘patches’ include source port ran-
domisation, source and destination IP randomisation,
and query randomisation: case toggling (‘0x20 encod-
ing’, [9]) and addition of a random preﬁx to queries [30].
‘unpre-
dictable’ ﬁelds copied from DNS requests to DNS re-
sponses, and hence are trivially insecure against MitM
attackers. However, these patches are considered ‘best
practice’, since they are believed to provide sufﬁcient se-
curity against off-path attackers (which is considered as
sufﬁcient defenses for many systems).

increase the entropy of

These ‘patches’

We show that, under common scenarios - which seem
likely to become even more common in the future, an
off-path attacker can efﬁciently circumvent all of these
mechanisms. Namely, an off-path attacker can perform
effective ‘domain-hijacking’ DNS poisoning attack, cir-
cumventing all the ‘patches’, and with even better efﬁ-
ciency than Kaminsky’s poisoning technique. However,
our domain-hijacking attack fails when DNSSEC is cor-
rectly and fully deployed. This attack works in scenarios
where DNSSEC is partially or incorrectly deployed, such
as permissive resolvers and islands of trust; currently,
such scenarios are rather common.

We also present three other attacks, which apply even

if DNSSEC is correctly and universally deployed:

Subdomain Injection,
is a poisoning attack which
causes resolvers to accept, cache and provide to clients
a mapping for a non-existing (child) domain, of a
DNSSEC-protected parent domain. As [5] observed,
when the parent zone supports NSEC3 opt-out, the at-
tacker can create fake (non-existing) sub-domains; this
can lead to attacks on Same Origin Policy such as XSS,
phishing and cookie stealing. We show how an off-path
attacker can achieve the same effect.

Name Server (NS) Hijacking,
is a poisoning at-
tack which causes resolvers to cache and use incorrect
name servers for a DNSSEC-protected domain, typically,
pointing them to name servers belonging to the attacker.
We show how this attack provides new, efﬁcient off-path
methods for trafﬁc analysis, covert channels and Denial
of Service; notice the attack and its applications are vi-
able, even if DNSSEC is universally and correctly de-
ployed, since the delegation NS and A resource records
(RRs) are not signed.

Name Server (NS) Blocking,
allows the attacker to
force resolvers to query name servers of his choice, and
stop using other name servers, by corrupting fragmented
responses from those name servers. This is not a poison-
ing attack, since it does not involve a resolver accepting
fake resource records. In fact, one application of this at-
tack is to facilitate poisoning, by causing resolvers to use
speciﬁc name servers, possibly known to be vulnerable;
this provides an effective mechanism to deploy the attack
of [32], which was, so far, considered impractical. Under
certain situations, this attack can also be used for off-path
Degradation of Service and trafﬁc analysis.

We summarise all our attacks, with their requirements,
in Table 1. The requirements are explained in Section 2;
for now, it sufﬁces to mention that they all reﬂect com-
mon situations in the current DNS, many of which are not
expected to change, even if DNSSEC is fully, universally

and correctly deployed. The main exception is attacks
which require partial or incorrect DNSSEC deployment;
however, not only is this requirement currently often sat-
isﬁed, but it is also required only for the ‘domain hijack-
ing’ attack.

In fact, ironically, the use of DNSSEC is often what
provides necessary requirements for our attacks to work.
Speciﬁcally, all of our attacks require ‘Fragmentable
zone’, implying fragmented DNS responses; and three of
the attacks require ‘Poisonable zone’, implying that the
second fragment contains complete resource record(s),
from the ‘authority’ and/or ‘additional’ sections. More
details on the requirements are presented within.

DNSSEC requires long resource records (RRs) which
results in long DNS responses. Long DNS responses
(i.e., above 512 byte) require support of the EDNS exten-
sion mechanism, [35], and often fragmented when sent
over UDP, since their size exceeds the path MTU. It is ex-
actly this fragmentation that facilitates our attacks; e.g.,
we show that off-path attackers can often replace the sec-
ond fragment of a packet, resulting in a seemingly-valid,
yet fake, DNS response, or ‘merely’ causing corruption
of the DNS response.

Fragmentation is known to be problematic or ‘harm-
ful’, mainly due to the negative impact on performance;
see the seminal paper of Kent and Mogul [23]. As a
result, fragmentation is usually avoided, e.g., by use of
path MTU discovery [28, 29], mainly for connection-
based transport protocol (TCP). However, DNS trafﬁc is
usually sent over UDP; while several signiﬁcant name
servers, e.g., com, edu, send long responses over TCP,
this may not be a good long-term solution, since the use
of TCP results in signiﬁcant overhead.

Related Work.

Our work builds upon previous disclosures of vulnera-
bilities due to the design or implementations of the frag-
mentation mechanism; we next mention few of the most
relevant. Zalewski [37] suggested that it may be possi-
ble to spoof a non-ﬁrst fragment of a (fragmented) TCP
packet. However, using such non-ﬁrst-fragment injec-
tions to TCP packets seems challenging. Furthermore,
currently almost all TCP implementations use path MTU
discovery [28, 29] and avoid fragmentation.

Several vulnerabilities related to IP fragmentation, and
speciﬁcally to predictable fragment identiﬁers (IP-ID)
values, are covered in [14, 15]. Later, predictable IP-
ID values were shown [12] to allow interception and in-
jection of fragments, as well as dropping of fragmented
packets. While for our purposes, a simple, randomised
modiﬁcation of fragments sufﬁces, we modify the tech-
nique from [12] to improve the efﬁciency of the attack in
some scenarios; details within.

Attacker Capabilities.

The required attacker capabilities include an arbitrary
off-path, spooﬁng-only adversary, that controls a ‘pup-
pet’, i.e., malicious (but sandboxed) script which can
query the resolver; see Figure 1.

Figure 1: Simpliﬁed network topology and attacker capabilities. The
spooﬁng attacker uses a puppet to invoke the query.

Contributions.

Incremental DNSSEC Deployment is Vulnerable We
show that incremental deployment of DNSSEC is
risky, and exposes resolvers to cache poisoning at-
tacks. We present techniques which allow efﬁcient
and effective Kaminsky-style [22] cache poisoning
attacks, using off-path spooﬁng adversaries. Our
techniques (exploiting fragmentation) allow to
circumvent the entropy (randomisation of query,
source port and IP) in DNS responses, as those
entropy ﬁelds remain in the ﬁrst fragment. This
exact technique of circumventing the entropy ﬁelds
allows us to revive the Kaminsky attack, and to
replace the authentic records in a DNS response
with spoofed records.

Subdomain Injection We show that an off-path at-
tacker can perform the attack that was believed to
be feasible for MitM.

Unsigned Delegation We suggest attacks exploiting un-
signed NS and A delegation records, breach-

3

ing privacy and anonymity, and inﬂicting de-
nial/degradation of service.

Name Server (NS) Blocking We introduce the name
server blocking technique, which allows an attacker
to force the resolver to stop using a particular name
server, and eventually, to query a name server of at-
tacker’s choice, e.g., a compromised name server,
when resolvers strictly follow RFC 4697 [25].

We performed an experimental evaluation of our attacks
against standard resolver software and issuing queries
to real TLD name servers, such as org, and against
the name server of the domain of our university, i.e.,
sec.cs.biu.ac.il.

Organisation.

In Section 2 we outline the assumptions which are re-
quired for our attacks and in Section 3.1 we provide the
basic mechanisms for our attacks. Then, in Section 3.2,
we show techniques for name server blocking, and in
Section 4 we present the poisoning attacks. We then con-
clude and propose defenses in Section 5.

2 Attacks Requirements

In this section we describe the requirements of the differ-
ent attacks that we introduce in this work. See Table 1 for
the requirements of each attack. Below, we dedicate one
subsection to the ‘Fragmentable zone’ and ‘Poisonable
zone’ requirements, and another one to the ‘Permissive
or Island’ requirement. We initiate with a brief descrip-
tion of three technical requirements: IP-ID, NSEC3 opt-
out and RFC 4697.

2.1 Technical Requirements

The IP-ID requirement is that attackers have ‘reasonable’
probability of success in guessing the IP-ID in the re-
sponses from the name servers. In IPv4, the IP-ID ﬁeld

2.2 Fragmentable Zone and Poisonable

Zone Requirements

We now describe our two fragmentation requirements:
‘Fragmentable zone’ and ‘Poisonable zone’. The ‘Frag-
mentable zone’ requirement is necesssary to all of our
attacks, and essentially amounts to the ability of the at-
tacker to cause fragmentation of a response from a name
server. As can be seen in Figure 2, long second frag-
ments are rather common, and responses are fragmented
from most top level domains (which deploy DNSSEC),
e.g., in the gov top-level domain, which is the top-level
domain with maximal adoption of DNSSEC so far.

Note that fragmentation can also occur even if the
resolver does not deploy DNSSEC, e.g.,
it relays a
query for a DNSKEY from the client, or due to other
types of records which can be long, e.g., different TXT
records, and/or when fragmentation occurs at relatively
low packet length l, due to success in sending fake ICMP
fragmentation-required alerts (see Section 2.2).

consists of only 16 bits; considering that fragment re-
assembly can usually hold a signiﬁcant number of frag-
ments for speciﬁc senders, typically at least 64, this im-
plies a good success probability even if attacker just
guesses the IP-ID values. Furthermore, many systems,
and in particular most name servers, authoritative for ma-
jor TLD zones, e.g., mil, use operating systems where IP-
ID is generated sequentially, either globally (for all des-
tinations) or with per-destination counters. In both cases,
we can signiﬁcantly improve the probability for a correct
match. We optimised the IP-ID prediction, in the per-
destination case, by adapting the technique of [12] to be
used with resolver. Note that in IPv6, it is harder to pre-
dict the IP-ID, since it is 32 bits and is sent only in frag-
mented trafﬁc; however, IPv6 speciﬁcally recommends
the use of sequential IP-ID, and hence can be guessed
with good chance of success. The bottom line is that the
IP-ID requirement is almost always satisﬁed.

is that

The NSEC3 opt-out requirement

the zone
uses NSEC3 DNSSEC record with opt-out option [26].
This allows attackers to create fake (non-existing) sub-
domains, and thereby facilitate XSS, phishing and cookie
stealing attacks. Sub-domain injection attack was pro-
posed in [5], that carried it out by a MitM attacker. In
fact, [5], also suggested that the attack could be carried
out by an off-path attacker, assuming that only the trans-
action ID in DNS packets is randomised. However, this
assumption does not hold for most DNS resolvers, as
they (at the very least) support source port randomisa-
tion. In Section 4.2 we show that such an attack can be
effectively carried out by an off-path attacker, that does
not intercept and inspect packets, and against patched
DNS resolvers, i.e., supporting source port randomisa-
tion, IP randomisation and DNS query randomisation.

In spite of the publication of this potential abuse by
MitM [5], NSEC3 opt-out is still widely used, and often
even recommended, since it improves performance (esp.
as long as DNSSEC is deployed only in small fraction of
the domains).

The RFC 4697 requirement is that resolvers adhere
to (one of) the recommendations in RFC 4697 [25, 36],
speciﬁcally, that a resolver will refrain from sending
queries to a name server after (few) failures, i.e., timeout
queries, within a predeﬁned time interval, and to lame
name servers, i.e., those that provide DNS responses
where (some of) the DNSSEC records, e.g., signatures,
are missing or corrupted. We show in Section 3.2 that
this allows an attacker to cause resolvers to stop using
speciﬁc name server(s), facilitating poisoning attacks, as
well as other attacks, including off-path trafﬁc analysis
and covert channel attacks. We validated this behaviour
in popular and standard DNS resolvers, see Section 3.2.

Figure 2: Length of ANY and NXDOMAIN responses of gov do-
mains. Domains taken from [10]

The ‘Poisonable zone’ requirement is necessary for
our poisoning attacks, and requires that at least one com-
plete record is present in the second fragment so that the
attacker can modify the second fragment and replace the
authentic resource record with a spoofed one, which gets
accepted and cached by the resolver. Details follow.

The ability to cause the required fragmentation de-
pends both on the records in the zone ﬁle, as well as
on the properties of the name server (including the route
from the name server to the resolver). In particular, frag-
mentation typically depends on the smallest MTU en-
route on the path from the name server to the resolver;
packets larger than 1500 bytes will normally be frag-
mented. The attacker may also sometimes be able to
‘trick’ the name server into fragmenting (even) shorter
packets before sending them. The attacker can inﬂict

4

fragmentation by sending a spoofed ICMP ‘fragmenta-
tion needed’ packet, similar to attacks in [13]. Let l
denote the size of packets, above which attacker can
cause fragmentation - the minimal MTU along the path,
or the minimal length that the attacker can ‘force’ the
name server to use by issuing fake ICMP fragmentation-
needed alerts.

In principle, name servers could be conﬁgured to
never allow fragmentation of responses, by sending re-
sponse packets of length up to (some bound of) l bytes
with the DF (do not fragment) bit set, and send longer
responses only via TCP, relying on TCP’s path MTU
discovery mechanism. However, the use of TCP for
DNS requests and responses has signiﬁcant performance
penalty, in addition to the overhead and complexity of
handling fragmentation-required ICMP alerts received
due to sending packets with the DF set, which reach
a network whose MTU is smaller than the packet size.
Hence, we do not expect name servers to send packets
with DF bit set (and indeed have not seen this behavior,
e.g., com, edu).

Note that for the ‘Fragmentable zone’ requirement to
hold, any fragmentation sufﬁces, e.g., of 1 byte, and there
is no requirement on the contents or length of the sec-
ond fragments. Hence, we only require existence of a
response whose length is greater than l.

A ‘Poisonable zone’ requirement is a stronger assump-
tion, since it also implies that the attacker is able to in-
clude a (fake) resource record in the response, such that
the response - and in particular the fake record - would
pass validation at the resolver and get cached. This re-
quires that the second fragment is predictable1 (to allow
attacker to avoid corrupting the checksum), and that it
contains at least one modiﬁable record - typically, an
NS record in the authority section, or an A (‘glue’)
record in the additional section. The challenge here
is mainly to ﬁnd queries which will result in second frag-
ments containing the necessary record(s) which the at-
tacker will replace with its own.

CACHING AND TIME TO LIVE (TTL). The DNS re-
solvers will not issue queries at all, if there is a corre-
sponding cached response. The TTL ﬁeld of each DNS
resource record indicates how long it may be cached by
resolvers.

The majority of TTLs of DNS records range between
one hour to one day, [20]. However, many records have
very low or even zero TTLs, e.g., records of content dis-
tribution networks (CDNs). Furthermore, some queries,
most notably for non-existent domain, always or usu-
ally would not be in cache. In fact issuing queries for
non-existent domain is similar to Kaminsky style attack,
and allows to initiate the attack as frequently as required

1The (off-path) attacker can query the victim name server itself to

select the query whose response it will poison.

since the attacker simply prepends a new random string
to the query. We demonstrated attacks exploiting frag-
mented non-existent domain2 or no-data3, [1], DNSSEC-
enabled responses. We also found that often DNSSEC
public veriﬁcation key (DNSKEY) records, which typ-
ically exceed MTU and get fragmented, have relatively
short TTL e.g., 15 minutes in org domain; they also of-
ten indicate short expiration time in the signatures.

Hence, caching would usually not prevent the attack,
and the expiration time of some record from the cache
can be anticipated by the attacker; there may be some
impact on length of attack and possibly on its commu-
nication costs too, but this would not make the attack
infeasible. Usually, successful poisoning happens within
reasonable time.

2.3

‘Permissive or Island’ requirement

The ‘Permissive or Island’ requirement is that DNSSEC
validation is either not used or is not correctly used, and
thus ignored by the resolver; ‘Island’ means that not
all the zones from the root to the target zone deploy
DNSSEC correctly, and ‘Permissive’ means that resolver
does not fail even DNSSEC-enabled responses do not
validate. In either of this cases, DNSSEC does not of-
fer protection, although deployed.

Figure 3: The DNSSEC deployment, in the list from [10] of 1500
subdomains of gov.

Permissive Resolvers. A permissive resolver is one
that supports DNSSEC, however, ignores DNSSEC val-
idation failures, e.g., if the signatures are missing or in-
valid; Unbound DNS resolver has an explicit ‘permis-
sive’ mode to support such operation. Obviously, for

2Non-existent domain DNS response contains an error bit in the
DNS header, i.e., RCODE=‘name error’, and indicates that the re-
quested name does not exists in the zone ﬁle.

3No data DNS response does not contain an error, i.e., RCODE=‘no
error’, and it means that the requested name exists in the zone ﬁle but
does not have the type requested in the DNS query.

such resolvers, DNSSEC does not provide added secu-
rity; yet, there appears to be a signiﬁcant number of such
resolvers [8,16], apparently due to concerns about loss of
connectivity due to interoperability and other problems
upon enforcing DNSSEC. Such implementors deploy
DNSSEC incorrectly or possibly via an ‘incremental de-
ployment’, aiming to preserve DNS functionality with
intermediate Internet devices, e.g., ﬁrewalls, and legacy
resolvers which may discard DNSSEC enabled DNS re-
sponses or strip DNSSEC signatures. This approach ap-
parently assumes that permissive use of DNSSEC can
provide evidence on whether the network can deploy
DNSSEC fully without problems or not, while not harm-
ing their security; unfortunately, this is not the case and
such resolvers are open to poisoning.

Island of Security. When the parent zone returns an
NSEC or NSEC3 (indicating that the child does not sup-
port DNSSEC), while the child does, the resolver can-
not establish a ‘chain-of-trust’ to the target zone and thus
cannot validate the DNSKEY of the zone. This holds for
many second level domains, e.g., children of gov TLD
(Figure 3), and even for some TLDs, e.g., mil. As a re-
sult, the resolver falls back to non-validating mode, and
ignores the signatures in a DNS response.

3 Fragment Overwriting and NS-Blocking

In this section, we present the Name Server blocking (NS-
blocking) attack, allowing attackers to cause resolvers
to avoid querying a name server. This attack requires
much weaker assumptions than the poisoning attacks,
Section 4, and only assumes that the responses get frag-
mented. Both NS-blocking and the poisoning attacks,
rely on Fragment Overwriting.

Fragment Overwriting, explained next, allows attack-
ers to modify fragmented packets.
In Section 3.2 we
explain how fragment overwriting allows an attacker to
cause standard-conforming resolvers to avoid a particular
name server, i.e., to perform NS-blocking. Then, in Sec-
tion 3.3, we discuss potential exploits of NS-blocking.

3.1 Fragment Overwriting

We now present a simple technique, allowing an attacker
to replace (overwrite) second fragments of (fragmented)
IP packets, in particular, of DNS responses sent to the
resolver; this basic technique is applied in all of our at-
tacks.

Suppose the original packet has payload x, and, after
fragmentation, it is sent as two IP packets y1, y2. Then,

the defragmentation process, running at the resolver4 on
inputs < y1, y2 > reproduces x.

To overwrite the second fragment, the attacker sends a
fake second fragment y(cid:48)
2 so that it arrives at the defrag-
mentation module before the authentic fragments y1, y2
of the DNS response. The defragmentation mechanism
in the IP layer will cache y(cid:48)
2, in anticipation of the rest
of the packet. By default, an unmatched fragment is kept
in the cache for 30 seconds or so, hence, ‘planting’ such
fake fragments is easy; we now explain how the attacker
can ensure a match with the original packet. Note that
it is easy to adjust this technique for the (less common)
case where fragments are sent in a reverse order: attacker
removes the authentic second fragment y2 from the re-
assembly buffer by sending an arbitrary y(cid:48)
1 (whose val-
idation ﬁelds match those of the y2), and the rest is the
same as above.

According to [18, 31] the fragments of a datagram are
associated with each other by their protocol number, the
value in their IP-ID ﬁeld, and by the source/destination
IP address pair. Thus both the ﬁrst authentic fragment
y1 and the second spoofed fragment y(cid:48)
2 must have the
same destination IP address (of the resolver that sent the
query), the same source IP address (of the responding
DNS server), the same protocol ﬁeld (UDP) and the same
fragment identiﬁer (IP-ID). In addition, the spoofed sec-
ond fragment should have the correct offset (as in the
authentic second fragment). The fragment reassembly
process, applied to the pair < y1, y(cid:48)
2 >, returns either a
failure or a different packet x(cid:48) (cid:54)= x.

Matching most of these parameters is not difﬁcult. In
particular, path MTU changes infrequently, and can be
found by attacker easily, e.g., by trace-route. In many
scenarios, the resolver has a single, known IP address;
zones typically have 6 IP addresses on average. The at-
tacker may sometimes also have some knowledge on the
likely name servers since the server selection algorithms
of many resolvers can be predicted [36], e.g., based on
latency, and may even use our attacks to disable some
name servers; in the worst case, the attacker can launch
the attack for each name server in parallel. In this work
we show techniques which often allow the attacker to
simply block the name servers of its choice.

It remains to ensure a match between the value of the
fragment identiﬁer (IP-ID) ﬁeld in the fake fragment y(cid:48)
2,
and the IP-ID in the authentic fragment y1 of the orig-
inal response x. There are several possible options for
IP-ID prediction, depending on the version of the IP pro-
tocol (IPv4 or IPv6), the method that the name server’s
OS uses to select IP-IDs, and on the receiver implemen-
tation.

In the most common case the communication is over

4Alternatively, defragmentation may happen and at intermediate de-

vice such as a ﬁrewall or NAT; there is no impact on the attack.

6

IPv4, where the IP-ID ﬁeld is 16 bits; and the host per-
forming the defragmentation process, i.e., the resolver or
ﬁrewall, has cache of 64 (or more) fragments per partic-
ular <source IP, destination IP, protocol> combination;
note that when more than 64 fragments (for the same tu-
ple) arrive, the oldest fragment is evicted from cache and
is replaced with the new one. Assuming that the attacker
has no knowledge on the process according to which
the IP-ID is incremented, and assuming the IP-ID in the
packet and in the fake fragment are selected indepen-
dently, it sufﬁces for the attacker to send 64 spoofed sec-
ond fragments, to ensure success probability of roughly
1/1000 of replacing the second fragment of a packet in
a single attempt. A much better probability of success
(as we discuss next) can typically be achieved, however,
even this attack can be sufﬁciently efﬁcient for many sce-
narios.

Most systems select the IP-ID sequentially. Of these,
many use a single counter for all destinations (globally-
sequential), as in Windows and by default in FreeBSD.
Other systems, e.g., Linux, use per-destination IP-ID
In both of these cases, the attacker can ef-
counters.
ﬁciently predict the IP-ID, achieving high probability
of success (certainly compared to 1/1000). In particu-
lar, for globally-incrementing IP-ID, which appears to
be more widely used, e.g., mil, the attacker can simply
learn the current value, and the rate of propagation, by
querying the name server directly. The technique we use
to achieve improved success probability in the case of
per-destination IP-ID, is an improvement of the methods
of [12]. These techniques ensure feasibility of the attack
even for most implementations of IPv6, in spite of its use
of 32-bits IP-ID ﬁeld.

3.2 Name-Server Blocking

In this subsection, we present the NS-blocking attack,
allowing an off-path attacker to dissuade resolvers from
querying particular name server(s); this can have multi-
ple goals, including denial/degradation of service, trafﬁc
analysis and more (see next subsection).

As indicated in Table 1, the NS-blocking attack has
two main requirements: the ability of the attacker to gen-
erate a DNS query from the resolver, that will result in
fragmented response from the ‘victim’ name server; and
that the resolver follows a behaviour recommended in
RFC 4697 [25, 36], namely, of avoiding a name server if
there are two or more failures within some time interval
(the time interval depends on the resolver implementa-
tion). We ﬁrst describe how the attacker is able to block
responses to a particular query, which does not rely on
the behaviour recommended in [25].

To block responses to a query from a particular name
server to the resolver, the attacker needs to send an ar-

bitrary fake second fragment y(cid:48)
2 with the anticipated IP-
ID and other parameters, to match a legitimate response,
as described above. The reassembly process using the
legitimate ﬁrst packet and the fake second fragment usu-
ally fails, and both fragments are silently dropped, by the
UDP layer or by the DNS resolver itself, due to incor-
rect checksum. The resolver will resend the query after
a timeout, but the timeout periods are known to the at-
tacker, who can easily send appropriate fake fragments
to cause loss of each of the responses, until the resolver
gives up. The number of attempted retransmissions de-
pends on the number of name servers that the zone uses;
if the zone uses one name server, the resolver gives up
in about 5 to 7 retransmissions, e.g., Bind9 after 7 time-
outs, and Unbound 1.4.10 after 5 timeouts, if the zone
uses more name servers then after one to two timeouts
the resolver queries the next name server.

We show how to apply this technique, in order to per-
form NS-blocking, i.e., block a speciﬁc name server, in-
stead of blocking just one particular packet. For this,
we need the assumption that the resolver avoids querying
unresponsive name servers, as per the recommendations
in [25, 36]. We exploit the fact that when the target name
server is not responsive, i.e., two or few queries times-
out, the resolver does not send5 any more queries to it.

The attack is illustrated in Figure 4. The idea is for
the attacker to send a spoofed fragment, e.g., one byte
long, which ruins the DNS response from the speciﬁc IP
address. After repeating the attack few times (depending
on the resolver software), e.g., twice in every 15 minute
interval for Unbound, the resolver marks the name server
(or rather the IP of the name server) as non-responsive
and does not send queries to it for the speciﬁed interval
of time which depends on the resolver implementation.

It is important to notice, that with most resolvers, NS-
blocking is effective against a speciﬁc name server IP,
and not limited to a speciﬁc domain. Namely, we can use
NS-blocking to dissuade a resolver from using a speciﬁc
name server, e.g., at IP address 38.103.2.1, using queries
(with fragmented responses) to one domain isi-sns.info,
and as a result the resolver will also avoid this name
server for all the other domains which that server serves,
e.g., paypal.com. This can be very useful, as name
servers often host multiple domains, and some of these
may use DNSSEC (and have fragmented responses), or
be owned (or corrupted) by the attacker (who can put
some other record with fragmented response), while oth-
ers may only have short (unfragmented) responses, in ad-
dition, some domains are much less frequently queried,

5Resolvers may send periodical probes, to detect when the target
server becomes responsive, however, the period is so long that we can
ignore it, e.g., for the Unbound name server, the period is 15 minutes.
A similar behaviour of avoiding non-responsive name servers was ob-
served by [36] in PowerDNS and WindowsDNS.

7

Figure 4: The Name-Server blocking attacks.

e.g., info, than popular domains, e.g., paypal.com, that
use the same name server, allowing to match the IP-ID
with little effort; e.g., [32] show that a typical domain
name depends on 46 name servers on average which also
serve other domains.

As illustrated in Figure 4, we performed the attack
against a 404.gov domain, whose non-existing domain
responses exceed 1500 bytes and thus get fragmented en-
route. This phase, of forcing the resolver to use a speciﬁc
IP, requires a puppet, i.e., a script conﬁned in a browser,
which issues DNS requests via the local caching DNS
resolver, at IP 1.2.3.4 in Figure 4.

In steps 1 and 2 the puppet coordinates with the
attacker and issues a DNS request for $123.404.gov
(where $123 is a random preﬁx). In steps 3 and 4, the
spoofer sends a forged second fragment, for all the possi-
ble name servers (i.e., a total of 2 spoofed fragments) ex-
cept one which the attacker wants the resolver to use for
its queries during the poisoning phase; the 404.gov do-
main has three name servers. This ensures that only one
IP address will result in a valid response, and the other
two result in a malformed DNS packets. The spoofed
second fragment is incorrect, and contains a single arbi-
trary byte (in addition to headers). In step 5, the spoofed
second fragment is reconstructed with the authentic ﬁrst
fragment resulting in a malformed DNS packet which
leaves the fragments reassembly buffer. This malformed
DNS response is then discarded by the resolver, and the
IP of the name server is marked6 as ‘non-responsive’.
When the authentic second fragment arrives, it does not
have a match and is discarded after a timeout. As a re-
sult the resolver does not receive the response, and after
a timeout it resends the DNS request to the next DNS
server, step 6. The same procedure applies here, and the

two unsuccessful responses; this is handled by sending two spoofed
fragments with consecutive IP-ID in IP headers.

from IP 162.138.183.11. This way, by wrecking the re-
sponses from all name servers except one, we forced the
resolver to direct all its queries for 404.gov domain to
162.138.183.11.

The IP-ID allocation algorithm does not have a signif-
icant impact on our attacks against such resolvers (e.g.,
Unbound), since ‘misses’, i.e., valid responses arriving
to the resolver from some IP, do not prevent the attack;
e.g., two failed (timed-out) queries sufﬁce for Unbound
to mark the server as non-responsive for 15 minute inter-
val.

The Wireshark capture, in Figure 5, that was run on the
resolver, demonstrates the experimental evalutation, i.e.,
the DNS packets entering/leaving the network card of the
resolver. During the course of the experiment the puppet
issued 6000 queries7 to the resolver. The spoofer initiates
the attack by sending three spoofed fragments to each IP
address except 162.138.183.11. For simplicity, the cap-
ture presents only the packets exchanged between the re-
solver and the name server of 404.gov at 162.138.191.23
(by adjusting a corresponding ﬁlter in wireshark); the
complete capture contains queries/responses from other
name servers too. Packets numbered 18-20 are the forged
fragments sent by the spoofer, with sequentially incre-
menting IP-IDs. Then puppet triggers a DNS request,
packet 29. The response from the name server contains
two fragments, packets 33 and 34. The ﬁrst fragment
is reassembled with spoofed fragment 18, resulting in a
malformed packet which is discarded by the resolver.

The second fragment is discarded after a timeout. In
packet 48 the resolver requests a public veriﬁcation key
of the 404.gov zone. The response contains three frag-
ments 49-51; the ﬁrst fragment is reconstructed with the
spoofed fragment in packet 20, which also results in a

7Note that our goal was to test the behaviour of the resolver, and
to check the frequency of the queries to non-responsive servers; in real
attack, once the IP-ID is known it is sufﬁcient to issue two queries to
mark the server as non-responsive.

malformed DNS response and is discarded. Note that
this request, in packet 48, was sent at 19:28. Based
on our tests it can be seen that when Unbound encoun-
ters a timeout twice for the same destination IP, it stops
sending further packets to that destination for 15 min-
utes.
Indeed, the next packet that is sent to that IP is
packet number 6848, at time 19:43. The same scenario
was observed with IP 162.138.191.11. The queries be-
tween 19:28 and 19:43 were sent only to 162.138.183.11,
avoiding 162.138.191.11 and 162.183.191.23. Note that
even if some of the responses (between packets 33 and
49) were valid and accepted by resolver, e.g., if they were
not fragmented, it did not make a difference, and two
timed-out responses in a 15 minute interval were sufﬁ-
cient for Unbound to stop querying those IP addresses;
this fact shows that the success probability of the attack
does not depend on the IP-ID selection mechanism.

3.3 NS-Blocking: Applications

NS-blocking is rarely a goal by itself; more often, it can
serve as a mechanism for other goals. We discuss three
such goals: facilitation of DNS poisoning; degradation
of service, and trafﬁc analysis.

Facilitate DNS poisoning In [32], Ramasubramanian
and Sirer conducted a survey showing that a typical do-
main name depends on 46 servers on average, and names
belonging to countries depend on a few hundred servers.
They note that compromising a server can lead to domain
hijacks and postulate that it is possible to hijack 30% of
the domains in Yahoo and DMOZ.org directories; DNS
servers are known to have vulnerabilities [11, 24]. How-
ever, [32] did not suggest a technique which can be used
to force a resolver to query a speciﬁc name server. NS-
blocking can provide exactly the necessary mechanism.
Also note that NS-blocking can assist in other DNS
cache poisoning attacks, including these in the next sec-
tion of this paper, as it allows the attacker to reduce the
number of servers that the resolver can query, possibly to
only one.

Off-path Degradation of Service By blocking ‘good’
name servers, an attacker can cause resolvers to send
their trafﬁc to speciﬁc, ‘bad’ name servers. In particu-
lar, resolvers may resort to name servers with very high
latency, causing unnecessary delays. Note that the zone
administrators often deploy techniques to distribute the
load between several physical servers sharing the same
IP, e.g., using load balancing or Anycast [17]. Typically
not all the name servers of a domain deploy such optimi-
sations, e.g., 6 out of 13 root servers, [27]. Our technique
allows the attacker to block those servers and to ‘force’
the resolver to query a name server which does not sup-
port such load balancing.

Off-path Trafﬁc Analysis and Covert Channel
Many names servers provide side-channels allowing an
attacker to learn or estimate the rate of requests handled
by the server. In particular, one simple and effective side-
channel is the IP-ID used by the name server.

We next show how an off-path attacker can use this
side channel, in conjunction with NS-blocking, to esti-
mate (analyse) the rate of requests from some resolver
r, to a particular domain foo.bar. NS-blocking can fa-
cilitate such off-path trafﬁc analysis in several ways; as
we later explain, this side-channel can even allow covert
communication (between a bot using the resolver, and an
attacker which is not controlling the name server).

First consider the case that one (or more) of the name
servers of foo.bar, say ns.foo.bar, is using globally-
incrementing IP-IDs (this is common). By using NS-
blocking, we can direct all or most of the DNS re-
quests from r to ns.foo.bar; by periodically querying
ns.foo.bar, the attacker can measure the rate of progress
of the IP-ID (and hence of responses sent by ns.foo.bar).
To further improve the measurement, the adversary may
use NS-blocking to cause other major resolvers to avoid
using ns.foo.bar.

This mechanism also allows off-path covert channel,
between an agent, say a bot b, which can use the resolver
r, and an off-path attacker o, which can make queries to
the name server ns.foo.bar. The bot can, e.g., encode in-

9

formation by signaling via the queries to ns.foo.bar (or
possibly, signaling using distinct queries to several do-
mains, each mapped to a speciﬁc, distinct name server).
The attacker can communicate to the bot by signaling via
loss of DNS responses.

The trafﬁc analysis attack is applicable also if none of
the name servers of foo.bar use globally-incrementing
IP-ID, provided at least one of them, say ns.foo.bar, uses
per-destination incrementing IP-ID. In this case, the at-
tacker will also need the ability to use the resolver r, e.g.,
via a puppet (malware such as script, in a sandbox). At-
tacker will use the puppet to keep track of the IP-ID used
by ns.foo.bar to send packets to r.

4 DNS Response Poisoning

The main idea behind our DNS cache poisoning attacks
is to apply Second-fragment Overwriting technique to
change the content of a DNS response by replacing au-
thentic resource records (RRs) with spoofed A or NS
RRs either for the existing domain or for a new subdo-
main. Speciﬁcally, the off-path attacker triggers a DNS
request to some victim domain, e.g., using a puppet (ma-
licious script conﬁned in a browser), and then spoofs
the second fragment. Depending on the section (of the
DNS response) which the second fragment contains, i.e.,
authority or additional, the attacker replaces au-
thentic records with his fake records8.

The main difference between the attacks is related to
the two intertwined issues: (1) frequency at which the
attack can be repeated, and (2) the queries which the at-
tacker can request. Both these issues depend on the free-
dom of the attacker over the (suitable) queries which it
can request.

NXDOMAIN or No-Data Responses. To evade
caching of the resolver the attacker can issue DNS re-
quests for ‘non-existing domain names’, i.e., responses
containing an RCODE with name error, or responses in-
dicating that the domain name exists but with a different
type, i.e., with ‘no data no error’ responses. Such re-
sponses exist in every domain. We found that domains
that use NSEC3 (which is currently the majority of the
domains) to indicate nxdomain (and no data) responses,
to be most suitable for our attacks as those responses
get fragmented in the authority section, such that
the second fragment contains at least one complete RR
(not including the EDNS RR). This technique is simi-
lar to Kamisky attack, as it allows the attacker to repeat
the attack as frequently as required, by selecting a differ-

8The attacker can also replace the RRs in the answer section, e.g.,
if it can issue DNS requests for ANY type RR, and if the DNSSEC is
either incorrectly, or not at all, deployed.

ent random name (prepended to the real domain name)
in each query. However, nxdomain responses may not
always get fragmented, e.g., if the zone does not use
NSEC3.

‘Existing Domain’ Responses.
If the attacker triggers
the attack with queries for existing domain names (with
a non-zero TTL) that get fragmented, e.g., responses to
DNSKEY, then it can trigger the attack only if the record
is not in cache. If the attack fails the ﬁrst time, it has
to wait till the record expires from cache, i.e., the TTL
reaches 0 or sinature expires.

Records with zero TTL, e.g., used for CDN networks,
can be requested repeatedly, thus allowing to launch
the attack as frequently as required, since they are not
cached. Such DNS responses with (zero TTL) records in
the answer section also contain (among others) NS and
A records (in authority and additional sections
respectively) with a cache-able TTL, which the attacker
can replace. However, the zero TTL records may not ex-
ist in every domain, and in particular, may not exist in a
domain which the attacker wishes to poison.

Thus the typically query choice of the attacker is be-
tween ‘nxdomain/no-data’ or ‘exiting domain’ (with a
non-zero TTL).

Poisoning the Cache.
Inserting spoofed records into
the cache is not straight forward, and merely changing
the records in a DNS response will not necessarily result
in resolver accepting and (then) caching them. In par-
ticular, the forged DNS response must comply with the
caching (and other) conditions which the resolvers im-
pose on DNS responses: the forged packet p(cid:48) must be a
valid DNS response; the ‘poisonous’ resource record r(cid:48)
must be valid for the speciﬁc response and section of the
response; and the resolver must cache r(cid:48).

The choice of forged DNS records, which we ap-
ply when modifying the DNS response, and semantics
and values of each ﬁeld in a DNS record, essentially
follow the known rules for DNS cache poisoning and
were investigated and studied (most notably) by Kamin-
sky [22] and Son and Shmatikov [33], and by Bau and
Mitchell [5] for DNSSEC enabled DNS responses.

4.1 Domain Hijacking

Domain hijacking can be performed when the ‘Permis-
sive or Island’ requirement is satisﬁed in tandem with
‘Poisonable zone’, i.e., either the resolver is permissive
or zone is an island of security and there is at least one
RR in the second fragment. In this case the attacker can
replace the RR(s) in the authentic second fragment of a
DNS response with (spoofed) NS or A RR(s) pointing at

10

his name server; the TTL in those spoofed RRs has to
match the TTL of the other RRs in that RRset.

Note that our domain hijacking techniques (below)
trivially apply to (fragmented) DNS responses which
are not protected with DNSSEC, we show such attack,
exploiting queries for TXT RRs and the correspond-
ing responses that get fragmented in full paper (the at-
tack course is essentially similar to the attacks presented
next).

We tested the domain hijacking attack in two scenar-
ios (as elaborated above): (1) nxdomain/no-data and (2)
existing domain. The ‘nxdomain/no-data’ (NSEC33) re-
sponse is often fragmented in the authority section,
and the additional section contains an9 EDNS RR.
This allows replacing the authority records in the
second fragment with fake NS RRs; we show this at-
tack in Section 4.1.1 replacing an NSEC3 record with
a spoofed NS record in the authority section in re-
sponse to a request for some non-exiting domain within
sec.cs.biu.ac.il, i.e., the (DNSSEC-enabled) domain of
the security group of the computer science department
within our university.. The ‘existing domain’ response,
e.g., DNSKEY or TXT, is also often fragmented. Such
responses typically contain records in the additional
section too, and allow changing the IP of name server
with IP of the attacker. We show this attack in Sec-
tion 4.1.2.

4.1.1 Injecting NS RR to NSEC3 Response

Typically, responses of type ‘non-existing domain (nxdo-
main) name error’ or ‘no data no error’, in domains that
support NSEC3, are of size between 1700 to 2000 bytes
on average, and when fragmented, at least one record
from the authority section appears in the second frag-
ment. This allows the attacker to replace the authen-
tic NSEC3 or RRSIG RR(s) with a NS RR for a new
name server; Figure 6. If the response does not contain
any other NS RRs then the attacker can set an arbitrary
high TTL, e.g., 6 days, to ensure that his RR stays in
cache even when the authentic NS RRs for that domain
expire. The attacker triggers a DNS request (via a pup-
pet) and synchronises (steps 1 and 2, Figure 6). Then
(step 3) the attacker sends a spoofed second fragment
containing an NS RR for domain sec.cs.biu.ac.il. This
spoofed fragment is combined with the authetic ﬁrst frag-
ment (step 3) and enters the cache; the authentic second
fragment is discarded after a timeout (step 5). Note that
the attacker can provide any arbitrary NS RR, in par-
ticular, one that is not in the same domain as the vic-
tim; in this attack we spoofed the response with name

9This is not a requirement, and according to [1] an A RR can ap-
pear in the additional section too. In this case, the attacker simply
replaces the A RR (instead of NS).

Figure 6: Poisoning an nxdomain (or no data) response, by replacing
the NSEC3 RR with an NS RR.

for a new NS RR, i.e., ams.sec.cs.biu.ac.il, in our do-
main, i.e., sec.cs.biu.ac.il, for testing purposes to ob-
serve that the subsequent queries of the resolver to do-
main sec.cs.biu.ac.il are sent to ams.sec.cs.biu.ac.il
and responses get cached. To ﬁnd the IP of the new NS
the resolver initiates a request for the A RR, and receives
and caches the IP supplied by the attacker (who controls
that name server).

The wireshark capture of the resulting poisoned DNS
response is in Figure 7. The authentic fragment con-
tained part of the RRSIG and two complete records,
i.e., NSEC3 and a corresponding RRSIG. The spoofed
fragment contained the authentic part of the RRSIG,
spanning the ﬁrst and second fragments, and two fake
NS records which replaced the authentic NSEC3 and
RRSIG. Note that since the RRSIG (as well as NSEC3)
are much larger than NS RRs, the attacker has to pad the
packet (with zeros) to the required length; the checksum
is adjusted in the padded area after the EDNS RR. For a
comparison, see the authentic DNS response in Figure 8.

When the second fragment contains at least one complete

IP for the name server of org domain, in a DNS response
for a DNSKEY of org domain.

In Figure 9 the resolver issues a DNS request for
the DNSKEY of org; this is an indirect way to trig-
ger a query, i.e., the resolver asks for the DNSKEY of
some domain automatically, when the DNSKEY expires
from cache, or when it needs to validate records for that
domain, e.g., to be able to validate an A record or a
non-existing domain (NSEC3) record; an attacker may
also be able to cause a resolver, which does not support
DNSSEC, to issue such a query, by sending an appropri-
ate request to the resolver. This query type is useful if
the response to an nxdomain query is not fragmented.

Figure 9: DNS poisoning attack of name server IP of org domain.
The resolver issues a query for a DNSKEY (e.g., when it expires from
cache, 15 minutes for org), and the spoofer sends a poisoned second
fragment containing the forged entries of org. The query for DNSKEY
of org can also be triggered indirectly by issuing a query for non-
existing (or for some other) domain within org.

protocol=UDP)). In the next line (133), the resolver
sends the DNS query to the name server.

of

Next line (134) is the ﬁrst fragment of authentic re-
sponse to the query, sent by the name server of org (at IP

12

199.249.112.1). This response matches the fake second
fragment already in the defragmentation cache, hence it
appears as a complete DNS response packet. The con-
tents of this packet are described in the lower panes; in
particular, see the two forged resource records in the ad-
ditional section, which contain incorrect (adversarial) IP
addresses for two of the name servers of the org domain.
Finally, notice that the authentic second fragment,
received in line 135, has no matching ﬁrst fragment
(since the one received was already reassembled with the
spoofed second fragment). Hence, it is entered into the
defragmentation cache, where it is likely to remain until
discarded (typically, after maximal lifetime of about 30
seconds).

4.2 Subdomain Injection

The delegation records, NS (name server) and A (IP ad-
dress), located in authority and additional sec-
tions, are not signed, [3]. This allows the attacker to
change the IP address (in the additional section) of
the name server of some victim domain, to its own ad-
dress, or to add a new name server (in authority sec-
tion) for the victim domain. Such NS and A records are
usually cached and used, for queries to the speciﬁed do-
main; see [33]. At this point, the attacker managed to
cause queries for the victim subdomain to be sent to a
machine controlled by the attacker.

This vulnerability, of redirecting DNSSEC enabled
DNS requests to malicious server by a man-in-the-
middle, was pointed out by Bernstein [6], yet with-
out a speciﬁc application for such an exploit. Bau and
Mitchell, [5], refute Bernstein’s claim of this being a vul-
nerability, by proving that it does not enable a man-in-
the-middle attacker any additional capabilities, and con-
clude that it does not pose a signiﬁcant threat. Indeed,
not signing the delegation records does not break the de-
sign requirements deﬁned for DNSSEC, [3]. However,
it exposes to NS Hijacking (leading to a range of other
attacks), Section 4.3, and to subdomain injection (as we

for

Resource records in the answer section of DNSSEC-
enabled domains are signed, hence, if the resolver per-
forms strict validation of DNSSEC, it should not ac-
cept unsigned records in the answer section. How-
ever since the delegation records in the authority
and additional sections are not signed, the attacker
can create a new subdomain, e.g., secure.bank.com
under bank.com, by creating an NS record (in the
authority section)
the new subdomain se-
cure.bank.com mapping it to the name server which
the attacker controls. This attack is only applicable to
DNSSEC protected domains that use NSEC3 opt-out:
the attacker may be able to use legitimate NSEC3 re-
sponses, e.g., for non-existing sub-domain, or other type
responses, e.g., DNSKEY, and turn them into what ap-
pears to be a legitimate referral to an unprotected sub-
this can be used for phishing attacks. Fur-
domain;
thermore, as [5] show, domains which deploy NSEC3
opt-out records are vulnerable to browser cookie theft
by a man-in-the-middle attacker, as they allow the at-
tacker to insert insecure delegations into DNS responses.
This is in contrast to the recommendations in [26] which
suggest that NSEC3 opt-out does not pose a signiﬁcant
threat. Bau and Mitchell performed the attack with a
man-in-the-middle attacker, using our techniques an off-
path spooﬁng attacker can perpetrate such attacks, see
Figure 7.

to save space, we performed the addition of a new subdo-
main as part of the name server hijacking attack, see Fig-
ure 7. The record: www.sec.cs.biu.ac.il is a new (non-
existing) subdomain under sec.cs.biu.ac.il and it points
at the name server ams.sec.cs.biu.ac.il controlled by
the attacker.

4.3 NS Hijacking

Using ‘server blocking’ the attacker can ‘ﬁx’ the target
name server. If the attacker compromised that server then
the attack is very damaging. Server ﬁxing can be useful
for other attacks too, e.g., to degrade efﬁciency (if the
target server is the slowest), for trafﬁc analysis, e.g., if
the attacker has man-in-the-middle capabilities but only
on the path to that ‘ﬁxed’ server, but not to other servers
for that domain.

Server ﬁxing in tandem with DNS poisoning can allow
the attacker to force the resolver to use a malicious name
server which the attacker controls, we call this ‘NS hi-
jacking’. This attack is most relevant when DNSSEC is
properly deployed. If the DNSSEC is not deployed cor-
rectly, then the attacker can simply hijack the domain.
The attack is combined of two phases: (1) poisoning the
A (or respectively NS) record in the DNS response (by
changing the authentic IP to the IP controlled by the at-
tacker), then (2) applying server blocking by ruining re-
sponses from all other name servers so that the resolver
marks those authentic servers as non-responsive.

The attack is similar to the attack in Section 4.1.1, thus

jacking. This is due to the fact that the TTL of the poi-
soned RR is higher than the TTL of the records cached
from previous responses, therefore, once those authentic
records expire from cache, the resolver will not request
them and will use the poisoned cached NS RR.

As a result of this attack the resolver will only query
the server of the attacker (as it is the only one that re-
sponds). However, the attacker cannot produce valid sig-
natures for the records that it returns, and therefore it
responds to resolver’s queries with records that are not
protected with DNSSEC. This attack has the ‘cache-or-
crash’ effect, i.e., the resolver will either cache those re-
sponses, or will timeout and not be able to provide re-
sponses (since this is the only name server that the re-
solver has for the victim domain). The response depends
on the speciﬁc resolver in question, e.g., Unbound 1.4.1
in permissive mode caches such responses, while Bind9
times-out and does not.

5 Conclusions and Defenses

We showed how an off-path attacker can efﬁciently ex-
ploit fragmented DNS responses to poison DNS caches.
Most DNS responses are short, and hence not frag-
mented; our attacks exploit DNSSEC records, which of-
ten result in fragmented responses.

We also showed that fragmented responses can be ex-
ploited by off-path attackers to force the resolvers to
query name servers of attacker’s choice.

The attacks are effective against valid implementation
of the DNS and IP speciﬁcations; furthermore, we have
conﬁrmed effectiveness against several domains, using
real network scenarios and common resolvers (Unbound
1.4.1 and Bind9).

We want to caution against drawing the conclusion
that DNSSEC should not be used. In fact, the best de-
fense is to apply DNSSEC correctly in all resolvers and
domains (without using NSEC3 opt-out); this will cer-
tainly prevent many of our poisoning attacks, and even
defend against more powerful Man-in-the-Middle adver-
saries. However, incremental DNSSEC deployment is
vulnerable to our cache poisoning attacks, and complete
adoption of DNSSEC may take considerable time, since
it depends on adoption by both name server and resolver.
Furthermore, this will not prevent the server blocking
attacks. Hence, we also discuss some other defenses,
which can be utilised by only one of the parties (unilat-
erally), and can also prevent the DNS response blocking
attacks.

The vulnerability which allowed us to launch the poi-
soning attacks against recursive resolvers, is due to the
fact that the resolver advertises a large EDNS buffer,
which is usually larger than the MTU, e.g., 1500 bytes.

Although support of large DNS responses is critical to fa-
cilitate DNSSEC enabled DNS responses, or public-key
certiﬁcates [34], such long responses can be (temporar-
ily) sent over TCP, using path MTU discovery and avoid-
ing fragmentation - unfortunately, at signiﬁcant perfor-
mance costs. Another countermeasure, possible at re-
solver, name server or even at intermediate gateway (ﬁre-
wall), is to set a maximal EDNS buffer value to at most
1500, or even less, to avoid fragmentation. In fact, re-
solvers may implement a simple protocol similar to path
MTU discovery, then set the value of the EDNS buffer
accordingly to the minimal MTU en route between the
resolver and the DNS server. When sending responses,
the name server should also set the DF bit in the IP
header to 1, i.e., do not fragment.

Another short-term defense, which administrators of
resolvers can apply, is to reduce the maximal number of
fragments cached; e.g., currently 64 by default in Linux
(per (source IP , dest IP , protocol) triplet). Of course,
reduction in this parameter may also increase packet loss.
Yet another possible defense for name servers, is to al-
ways add a random RR to any packet over certain size
(i.e., which may be fragmented). A simple type A re-
source record, containing random IP address for some
ﬁctitious domain name, would sufﬁce. The TTL of such
an RR should be set to zero to prevent the resolver from
caching that record. This would prevent the attacker from
being able to predict and (correctly) adjust the checksum
value. If there are multiple vulnerable fragments, such a
random RR should appear in each fragment.

Finally, we suggest to be careful when deploying the
proposal in [25, 36] (for server selection) which recom-
mends to avoid querying non-responsive servers. Re-
solvers that do not conform to that recommendation, e.g.,
Bind9, are not vulnerable to our server-pinning attacks.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1482988#c0)  Florian Weimer    2017-08-18 14:15:34 UTC  ``` Upstream glibc writes this:  * The “ip6-dotint” and “no-ip6-dotint” resolver options, and the   corresponding RES_NOIP6DOTINT flag from <resolv.h> have been removed.   “no-ip6-dotint” had already been the default, and support for the   “ip6-dotint” option was removed from the Internet in 2006.  Lack of Internet support means that we can safely remove this from our glibc as well.  Relevant upstream commit:  commit 7ec47a85d865e7bc43358633a0f960921dbfc373 Author: Florian Weimer <fweimer> Date:   Fri Oct 7 13:55:47 2016 +0200      resolv: Remove RES_NOIP6DOTINT and its implementation   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1482988#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-10 14:00:52 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=21361#c0)  Florian Weimer    2017-04-07 14:30:37 UTC  ``` When ENDS0 is enabled, glibc currently requests large DNS responses over UDP (up to 65536 bytes).  This is problematic because the randomized transaction ID and source port randomization both protect only the first fragment in a response.  As a partial countermeasure, the stub resolver should lower the advertised buffer size to 1200 bytes (IPv6 minimum MTU of 1280 minus some tunnel overhead).  With some cooperation from the server, this should avoid fragmentation. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=21361#c1)  Sourceware Commits    2017-04-13 11:11:57 UTC  ``` This is an automated email from the git hooks/post-receive script.

The GNU C Library is used as *the* C library in the GNU system and in GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel.  The GNU C Library is primarily designed to be a portable and high performance C library.  It follows all relevant standards including ISO C11 and POSIX.1-2008.  It is also internationalized and has one of the most complete internationalization interfaces known.  The GNU C Library webpage is at <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>  Packages for the 2.26 release may be downloaded from:         <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libc/>         <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/>  The mirror list is at <http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>  NEWS for version 2.26 =====================  Major new features:  * A per-thread cache has been added to malloc. Access to the cache requires   no locks and therefore significantly accelerates the fast path to allocate   and free small amounts of memory. Refilling an empty cache requires locking   the underlying arena. Performance measurements show significant gains in a   wide variety of user workloads. Workloads were captured using a special   instrumented malloc and analyzed with a malloc simulator. Contributed by   DJ Delorie with the help of Florian Weimer, and Carlos O'Donell.  * Unicode 10.0.0 Support: Character encoding, character type info, and   transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 10.0.0, using   generator scripts contributed by Mike FABIAN (Red Hat).   These updates cause user visible changes, especially the changes in   wcwidth for many emoji characters cause problems when emoji sequences   are rendered with pango, see for example:   <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=780669#c5>  * Collation of Hungarian has been overhauled and is now consistent with "The   Rules of Hungarian Orthography, 12th edition" ([Bug 18934](show_bug.cgi?id=18934 "RESOLVED FIXED - hu_HU: collate: fix multiple bugs and add tests")).  Contributed by   Egmont Koblinger.  * Improvements to the DNS stub resolver, contributed by Florian Weimer:    - The GNU C Library will now detect when /etc/resolv.conf has been     modified and reload the changed configuration.  The new resolver option     “no-reload” (RES_NORELOAD) disables this behavior.    - The GNU C Library now supports an arbitrary number of search domains     (configured using the “search” directive in /etc/resolv.conf);     previously, there was a hard limit of six domains.  For backward     compatibility, applications that directly modify the ‘_res’ global     object are still limited to six search domains.    - When the “rotate” (RES_ROTATE) resolver option is active, the GNU C     Library will now randomly pick a name server from the configuration as a     starting point.  (Previously, the second name server was always used.)  * The tunables feature is now enabled by default.  This allows users to tweak   behavior of the GNU C Library using the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable.  * New function reallocarray, which resizes an allocated block (like realloc)   to the product of two sizes, with a guaranteed clean failure upon integer   overflow in the multiplication.  Originally from OpenBSD, contributed by   Dennis Wölfing and Rüdiger Sonderfeld.  * New wrappers for the Linux-specific system calls preadv2 and pwritev2.   These are extended versions of preadv and pwritev, respectively, taking an   additional flags argument.  The set of supported flags depends on the   running kernel; full support currently requires kernel 4.7 or later.  * posix_spawnattr_setflags now supports the flag POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID, to   create a new session ID for the spawned process.  This feature is   scheduled to be added to the next major revision of POSIX; for the time   being, it is available under _GNU_SOURCE.  * errno.h is now safe to use from C-preprocessed assembly language on all   supported operating systems.  In this context, it will only define the   Exxxx constants, as preprocessor macros expanding to integer literals.  * On ia64, powerpc64le, x86-32, and x86-64, the math library now implements   128-bit floating point as defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (IEEE   754-2008) and ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015.  Contributed by Paul E. Murphy,   Gabriel F. T. Gomes, Tulio Magno Quites Machado Filho, and Joseph Myers.    To compile programs that use this feature, the compiler must support   128-bit floating point with the type name _Float128 (as defined by TS   18661-3) or __float128 (the nonstandard name used by GCC for C++, and for   C prior to version 7).  _GNU_SOURCE or __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__   must be defined to make the new interfaces visible.    The new functions and macros correspond to those present for other   floating-point types (except for a few obsolescent interfaces not   supported for the new type), with F128 or f128 suffixes; for example,   strtof128, HUGE_VAL_F128 and cosf128.  Following TS 18661-3, there are no   printf or scanf formats for the new type; the strfromf128 and strtof128   interfaces should be used instead.  Deprecated and removed features, and other changes affecting compatibility:  * The synchronization that pthread_spin_unlock performs has been changed to   now be equivalent to a C11 atomic store with release memory order to the   spin lock's memory location.  Previously, several (but not all)   architectures used stronger synchronization (e.g., containing what is   often called a full barrier).  This change can improve performance, but   may affect odd fringe uses of spin locks that depend on the previous   behavior (e.g., using spin locks as atomic variables to try to implement   Dekker's mutual exclusion algorithm).  * The port to Native Client running on ARMv7-A (--host=arm-nacl) has been   removed.  * Sun RPC is deprecated.  The rpcgen program, librpcsvc, and Sun RPC headers   will only be built and installed when the GNU C Library is configured with   --enable-obsolete-rpc.  This allows alternative RPC implementations, such   as TIRPC or rpcsvc-proto, to be used.  * The NIS(+) name service modules, libnss_nis, libnss_nisplus, and   libnss_compat, are deprecated, and will not be built or installed by   default.    The NIS(+) support library, libnsl, is also deprecated.  By default, a   compatibility shared library will be built and installed, but not headers   or development libraries. Only a few NIS-related programs require this   library.  (In particular, the GNU C Library has never required programs   that use 'gethostbyname' to be linked with libnsl.)    Replacement implementations based on TIRPC, which additionally support   IPv6, are available from <<https://github.com/thkukuk/>>.  The configure   option --enable-obsolete-nsl will cause libnsl's headers, and the NIS(+)   name service modules, to be built and installed.  * The DNS stub resolver no longer performs EDNS fallback.  If EDNS or DNSSEC   support is enabled, the configured recursive resolver must support EDNS.   (Responding to EDNS-enabled queries with responses which are not   EDNS-enabled is fine, but FORMERR responses are not.)  * res_mkquery and res_nmkquery no longer support the IQUERY opcode.  DNS   servers have not supported this opcode for a long time.  * The _res_opcodes variable has been removed from libresolv.  It had been   exported by accident.  * <string.h> no longer includes inline versions of any string functions,   as this kind of optimization is better done by the compiler.  The macros   __USE_STRING_INLINES and __NO_STRING_INLINES no longer have any effect.  * The nonstandard header <xlocale.h> has been removed.  Most programs should   use <locale.h> instead.  If you have a specific need for the definition of   locale_t with no other declarations, please contact   libc-alpha@sourceware.org and explain.  * The obsolete header <sys/ultrasound.h> has been removed.  * The obsolete signal constant SIGUNUSED is no longer defined by <signal.h>.  * The obsolete function cfree has been removed.  Applications should use   free instead.  * The stack_t type no longer has the name struct sigaltstack.  This changes   the C++ name mangling for interfaces involving this type.  * The ucontext_t type no longer has the name struct ucontext.  This changes   the C++ name mangling for interfaces involving this type.  * On M68k GNU/Linux and MIPS GNU/Linux, the fpregset_t type no longer has   the name struct fpregset.  On Nios II GNU/Linux, the mcontext_t type no   longer has the name struct mcontext.  On SPARC GNU/Linux, the struct   mc_fq, struct rwindow, struct fpq and struct fq types are no longer   defined in sys/ucontext.h, the mc_fpu_t type no longer has the name struct   mc_fpu, the gwindows_t type no longer has the name struct gwindows and the   fpregset_t type no longer has the name struct fpu.  This changes the C++   name mangling for interfaces involving those types.  * On S/390 GNU/Linux, the constants defined by <sys/ptrace.h> have been   synced with the kernel:      - PTRACE_GETREGS, PTRACE_SETREGS, PTRACE_GETFPREGS and PTRACE_SETFPREGS       are not supported on this architecture and have been removed.      - PTRACE_SINGLEBLOCK, PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER, PTRACE_PEEKUSR_AREA,       PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA, PTRACE_GET_LAST_BREAK, PTRACE_ENABLE_TE,       PTRACE_DISABLE_TE and PTRACE_TE_ABORT_RAND have been added.    Programs that assume the GET/SETREGS ptrace requests are universally   available will now fail to build, instead of malfunctioning at runtime.  Changes to build and runtime requirements:  * Linux kernel 3.2 or later is required at runtime, on all architectures   supported by that kernel.  (This is a change from version 2.25 only for   x86-32 and x86-64.)  * GNU Binutils 2.25 or later is now required to build the GNU C Library.  * On most architectures, GCC 4.9 or later is required to build the GNU C   Library.  On powerpc64le, GCC 6.2 or later is required.    Older GCC versions and non-GNU compilers are still supported when   compiling programs that use the GNU C Library.  (We do not know exactly   how old, and some GNU extensions to C may be _de facto_ required.  If you   are interested in helping us make this statement less vague, please   contact libc-alpha@sourceware.org.)  Security related changes:  * The DNS stub resolver limits the advertised UDP buffer size to 1200 bytes,   to avoid fragmentation-based spoofing attacks (CVE-2017-12132).  * LD_LIBRARY_PATH is now ignored in binaries running in privileged AT_SECURE   mode to guard against local privilege escalation attacks (CVE-2017-1000366).  * Avoid printing a backtrace from the __stack_chk_fail function since it is   called on a corrupt stack and a backtrace is unreliable on a corrupt stack   (CVE-2010-3192).  * A use-after-free vulnerability in clntudp_call in the Sun RPC system has been   fixed (CVE-2017-12133).

# RHSA-2018:0805 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: glibc security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0805)

## Topic

An update for glibc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the name service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

Security Fix(es):

* glibc: realpath() buffer underflow when getcwd() returns relative path allows privilege escalation (CVE-2018-1000001)
* glibc: Buffer overflow in glob with GLOB\_TILDE (CVE-2017-15670)
* glibc: Buffer overflow during unescaping of user names with the ~ operator (CVE-2017-15804)
* glibc: denial of service in getnetbyname function (CVE-2014-9402)
* glibc: DNS resolver NULL pointer dereference with crafted record type (CVE-2015-5180)
* glibc: Fragmentation attacks possible when EDNS0 is enabled (CVE-2017-12132)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank halfdog for reporting CVE-2018-1000001. The CVE-2015-5180 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer (Red Hat Product Security).

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the glibc library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.
