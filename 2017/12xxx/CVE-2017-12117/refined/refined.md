- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `miner_start` API in cpp-ethereum's JSON-RPC server lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to trigger functionality that should be restricted to administrators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization (CWE-285) in the `miner_start` API, absence of privilege checks, default binding of the interface to 0.0.0.0 exposing it to the world, lack of enforcement of the 'application/json' Content-Type which can be abused via CSRF/SSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authorization and start the miner, potentially leading to unauthorized resource usage and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON request to the exposed JSON-RPC interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the exposed JSON-RPC interface. No authentication is required. The vulnerability is exploitable even if the server is behind a NAT due to lack of Content-Type checking.
