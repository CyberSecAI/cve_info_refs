# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

### @sbooth **[sbooth](/sbooth)** commented [Jul 23, 2017](#issue-244912993)

If TDRC is encrypted, FrameFactory::createFrame() returns UnknownFrame

which causes problems in rebuildAggregateFrames() when it is assumed

that TDRC is a TextIdentificationFrame

Fixes [#829](https://github.com/taglib/taglib/issues/829)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Is this sufficient to fix [#829](https://github.com/taglib/taglib/issues/829) or should all uses of `static_cast` be replaced in the event a frame is encrypted? |
