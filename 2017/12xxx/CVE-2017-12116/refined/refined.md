- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization checks in the implementation of the `miner_setGasPrice` API in cpp-ethereum's JSON-RPC server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of authorization checks for the `miner_setGasPrice` API, which is intended for administrator use.
    - The JSON-RPC interface is bound to 0.0.0.0 by default, making it accessible from the outside world.
    - The server does not enforce the 'application/json' Content-Type, enabling CSRF or SSRF attacks.
    - There is no apparent option to limit the JSON-RPC interface to localhost.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can remotely trigger functionality reserved for administrator privileges without any authentication, allowing them to set the gas price for mining operations.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a JSON request to the `miner_setGasPrice` API. This can be achieved by sending a POST request to the server if accessible remotely, or via CSRF/SSRF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the JSON-RPC server, which is exposed by default. No credentials are required.
