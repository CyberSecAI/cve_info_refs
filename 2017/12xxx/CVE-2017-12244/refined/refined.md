Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper input validation of fields within the IPv6 extension header packet. Specifically, the detection engine parsing of IPv6 packets in Cisco Firepower System Software is flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper input validation of IPv6 extension header fields.
-  Failure to handle maliciously crafted IPv6 packets correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause high CPU utilization and unexpected restarts of the Snort process.
- **Traffic Inspection Bypass or Drop:** The restart of the Snort process can lead to either traffic inspection being bypassed, or traffic being dropped, depending on the platform and configuration.
    - **Firepower Platforms**: Passive and bypass interfaces bypass Snort, while routed, switched and non-bypass interfaces drop the traffic. FTD drops the traffic.
    - **ASA 5500-X with FirePOWER**: If `sfr fail-open` is configured, traffic bypasses Snort and is not dropped.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Remote network-based attack.
-   Attacker sends a malicious IPv6 packet to the detection engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   Unauthenticated, remote attacker.
-   Ability to send network traffic (malicious IPv6 packets) to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic.
-   The issue affects Cisco Firepower System Software Releases 6.0 and later when file action policies are configured.
-   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds.
- The provided CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H` gives a base score of 8.6, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
