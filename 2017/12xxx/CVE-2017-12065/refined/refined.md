Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12065:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The content from `security.gentoo.org` explicitly mentions CVE-2017-12065 in relation to multiple vulnerabilities found in Cacti that could lead to remote code execution or access restriction bypass. Therefore, the content is directly relevant to the specified CVE. The github issue report #877 also shows it relates to the CVE since it states "the uncorrected fix to isue847([CVE-2017-11163](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pv4g-wvg2-f292 "CVE-2017-11163"))"
The commit from github indicates it is addressing issue #877.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **XSS Vulnerability:** The primary XSS vulnerability stems from the improper use of `htmlspecialchars()` in `./lib/html_form.php` at line 1153. Specifically, the function was not using the `ENT_QUOTES` flag which means it was not encoding single quotes (`'`). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code through the `$cancel_url` parameter.
    *   **Path Traversal:** The path traversal vulnerability originates from the ability of an authenticated user to modify the path for Cacti log files. The `path_cactilog` parameter is read from the config and then used without sanitization which allows an attacker to read any file from the server that the webserver has access to.
    *   **Code Execution:** The code execution vulnerability is a result of the `path_php_binary` parameter in `spikekill.php` being editable by an authenticated user and then passed into shell_exec without sanitization or validation. This allows for command injection and arbitrary code execution.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Path Traversal
    *   Remote Code Execution

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which could lead to session hijacking, cookie stealing, or other client-side attacks. As stated by the researcher in the github issue, this can be used to obtain the cookie of an authenticated user and escalate attacks.
    *   **Path Traversal:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the system, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **XSS:** The XSS attack vector is through the `cancel_url` parameter. The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL that contains javascript in the url itself.
    *  **Path Traversal:** An authenticated user can modify the path of the log file through the UI. The attacker would need to modify the `path_cactilog` setting to point to the desired file.
    *   **Code Execution:** An authenticated user can modify the path of the php binary through the UI. The attacker would need to modify the `path_php_binary` setting to point to the desired command. Then a request is made to `spikekill.php`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **XSS:** No authentication required directly. However, a social engineering attack or other means to deliver a crafted link to a privileged user is needed.
    *   **Path Traversal/Code Execution:** Requires an authenticated user with access to edit Cacti settings (path variables).
    *   The github issue report mentions combining XSS to steal cookies and then gain access for path traversal and code execution.
