Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12469:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in `util/ccnl-common.c`.
- The `calloc()` function is used to allocate memory for a `struct key_s` pointer, but the size of the structure itself is not allocated. This causes a write to unallocated memory when the structure's members are accessed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect memory allocation:** The code allocates memory for a pointer to a `struct key_s` instead of allocating the memory for the actual structure itself.
- **Buffer overflow**: Writing to the unallocated memory results in a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The vulnerability allows context-dependent attackers to have an unspecified impact. The provided data does not specify the exact impact, however, based on the type of vulnerability, it may lead to code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a key is present and the key length is greater than zero.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path by providing a key. No specific privileges are mentioned, however, the CVSS score indicates "None".

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Eric Sesterhenn / X41 D-Sec.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in the CCN-lite V2 release.
- The issue was tracked in issue #135 on the github repository.
