…t().

IVs must be random and one-time (never reused). Additionally, by deriving it from the key, the key length was effectively reduced to 128 bits.

**Incorrect IV generation for encryption**

### Background

Block ciphers make use of random, unique values in order to initialize the algorithm when there is a feedback from one
round to the next. Those values are commonly known as *Initialization Vectors* or *IV*s. IVs are public (they are
attached to the resulting ciphertext) and therefore they must never be reused, and must be generated by a proper
*Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generator* (CSPRNG) in order to be secure.

### Description

An issue with IV generation has been discovered in the `SimpleSAML\Utils\Crypto::_aesEncrypt()` method, where the IV
is not generated randomly but based on the first 16 bytes of the SHA256 hash of the secret given as a parameter. This
unfortunate bug has two direct implications:

* The security of the secret key is downgraded effectively from 256 bits to 128, given that the first 16 bytes were
  made public in the resulting IV.
* The security of the encryption is compromised due to the fact that IVs are reused if the same secret is used twice,
  as it happens by default in the `SimpleSAML\Utils\Crypto::aesEncrypt()` method, which uses the salt configured as the
  secret.

### Affected versions

All **SimpleSAMLphp** versions from **1.14.0** to **1.14.11**, both included.

### Impact

The issue described here undermines the security of the encryption offered by the
`SimpleSAML\Utils\Crypto::aesEncrypt()` method, and therefore any secrets encrypted with it might be compromised by an
attacker with enough knowledge or resources.

### Resolution

Upgrade to the [latest version](/download).

### Credit

This security issue was discovered and reported on March 29, 2017 by Chris Czub (Duo Security).
