Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12225:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the web functionality of Cisco Prime LAN Management Solution. This allows a remote attacker to hijack another user's administrative session. The vulnerability is related to session handling, specifically a session fixation issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Session Fixation:** The application does not properly handle session IDs, allowing an attacker to potentially force a user to use a session ID known to the attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated attacker to hijack an existing user's administrative session.
- This could result in an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the system with the hijacked user's privileges and perform administrative actions.
- The integrity of the system may be compromised due to unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires some form of user interaction to initiate the hijacking of the session. The user must be tricked into using a session ID controlled by the attacker, likely through a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cisco Prime LAN Management Solution
- The attacker needs to trick another user to use a session ID controlled by them.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 4.3 with the vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N` which translates to:
    -   **AV:N (Attack Vector: Network)**
    -   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)**
    -   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None)**
    -  **UI:R (User Interaction: Required)**
    -   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged)**
    -   **C:N (Confidentiality Impact: None)**
    -   **I:L (Integrity Impact: Low)**
    -   **A:N (Availability Impact: None)**

- There are no known workarounds.
- Cisco has released fixed software to address this vulnerability, referenced in the associated bug ID (CSCvf58392).
-  The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
