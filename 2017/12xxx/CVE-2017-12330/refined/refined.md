Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12330:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient input validation of command arguments to the CLI parser in Cisco NX-OS System Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Command Injection: The vulnerability allows for command injection through crafted command arguments passed to the CLI parser.
*   Inadequate Input Validation: The CLI parser doesn't properly validate or sanitize command arguments, enabling injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary Command Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands at the privilege level of the user logged in to the CLI.
*   Privilege Escalation (in VDC): On devices supporting multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs), an attacker could potentially execute commands outside the user's current VDC environment, essentially escalating privileges.
*   Compromise of Device: The ability to execute arbitrary commands could result in a complete compromise of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the device's CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Authenticated User: The attacker must be an authenticated user with CLI access on the vulnerable device.
*   Local Access: The attacker needs to be able to input commands directly into the CLI of the affected Cisco device.

**Affected Products:**
* MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches
* Nexus 2000, 5000, 5500, 5600, and 6000 Series Switches
* Nexus 3000 Series Switches
* Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches
* Nexus 9000 Series Switches - Standalone, NX-OS mode
* Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules

**Mitigation:**
* Software updates that address this vulnerability are available from Cisco.
* No workarounds are available.
