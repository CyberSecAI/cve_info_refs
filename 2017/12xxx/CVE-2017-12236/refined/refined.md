Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A logic error introduced via a code regression in the Cisco IOS XE Software's implementation of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Authentication bypass vulnerability in the LISP implementation on Cisco IOS XE Software.
- Improper authentication checks during Endpoint Identifier (EID) registration to a Routing Locator (RLOC) in the map server/map resolver (MS/MR).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass authentication checks.
- Attackers can inject invalid mappings of EIDs to RLOCs in the MS/MR.
- This could lead to disruption of services relying on LISP mappings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack over IPv4 or IPv6.
- Attacker sends specific valid map-registration requests to a vulnerable map server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send LISP map-registration requests to a vulnerable Cisco device acting as a map server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- Attacker requires knowledge of the specific valid map registration requests format to exploit.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco devices running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software and configured with LISP as an IPv4 or IPv6 map server.
- Specifically affects Cisco IOS XE Software release trains 3.9E and Everest 16.4.
- Devices configured with LISP as an egress tunnel router, ingress tunnel router, or purely as a map resolver are not affected.
- The vulnerability is identified by the Cisco Bug ID CSCvc18008.
- There are no workarounds available.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- Exploitation will cause unknown IP addresses to appear in the "Who Last Registered" column of the output of the `show lisp site` command on the map server against sites that should be performing authentication.
