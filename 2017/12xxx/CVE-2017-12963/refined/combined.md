Changing version to '28'.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1482335#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 22:02:15 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1482335#c3)  Michael Catanzaro    2020-11-02 15:11:11 UTC  ``` Red Hat Bugzilla is not an appropriate forum for reporting security bugs in upstream components. As you can see, your bug report here has been ignored for three years, and will likely continue to be ignored, so I'm going to go ahead and close it. Please feel free to report this upstream if you want the developers to look at it.   ``` |  |
