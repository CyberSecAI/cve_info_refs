        This module exploits an expression language injection
vulnerablity, along with
        an authentication bypass vulnerability in Hewlett Packard
Enterprise Intelligent
        Management Center before version 7.3 E0504P04 to achieve
remote code execution.

        The HP iMC server suffers from multiple vulnerabilities allows
unauthenticated
        attacker to execute arbitrary Expression Language via the
beanName parameter,
        allowing execution of arbitrary operating system commands as
SYSTEM. This service
        listens on TCP port 8080 and 8443 by default.

        This module has been tested successfully on iMC PLAT v7.3

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# One man's patch is another man's treasure: A tale of a failed HPE patch

February 06, 2018 | Vincent Lee

[SUBSCRIBE](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/rss/)

**A further analysis of various attack vectors in HPE IMC – Part 2. You can find Part 1** [here](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2017/12/01/exploiting-untrusted-objects-through-deserialization-analyzing-1-of-100-hpe-bug-submissions)**.**

Developers often think code behind an authentication mechanism is safe from attackers and therefore the program inputs are relatively “safe.” This thought often results in sloppy code. Once the attacker finds a hole in the authentication mechanism, a floodgate of post-authentication bugs become available to the attacker to exploit the system.

Many ZDI advisories involving HPE IMC vulnerabilities are post-authentication bugs that require authentication bypass. However, a frequent ZDI contributor submitted an authentication bypass bug ([ZDI-18-139](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-18-139/)) to make these post-auth bugs valuable to attackers. The root cause of this bypass results from an incomplete fix of [ZDI-17-161](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-17-161/), which was originally discovered by a different researcher and insufficiently patched by [HPE](https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03716en_us) in March 2017.

This blog analyzes the patch for ZDI-17-161 to see if we can find this bug ourselves, and examines the submitted authentication bypass bug. Finally, we’ll walk through the esoteric Expression Language injection (ZDI-17-663) vulnerability that relies on this bypass to get RCE as SYSTEM.

**Finding the CVE-2017-5791 through patch diffing**

As shown in the `web.xml`, HPE IMC uses the `UrlAccessController` class as an access control filter to restrict access to protected URLs from unauthenticated users. [Filter](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/Filter.html) is a Java servlet feature commonly used by developers to implement authentication and access control.

The following is a snippet of the decompiled patch for the `UrlAccessController::doFilter()` method from IMC7.3E0504P2, the insufficient fix for ZDI-17-161:

In the patch, a guard function, `normalizeSyntax()`, is added to sanitize the input prior to the filter logic. This function exits but does nothing if ".." characters are absent from the path. Without further analysis, we can tell `normalizeSyntax()` attempts to do some “normalization” with paths that contain ".." characters. In fact, that was exactly the bug as previously reported in ZDI-17-161. If the URL path contains `/imc/primepush/../<target URI>`, the attacker can bypass the filter and access other servlets that are normally blocked from unauthenticated users.

**ZDI-18-139: Finding the treasure hidden in the patch**

If you take a closer look at the newly added `normalizeSyntax()`, it is not hard to spot a critical bug in the patch that can be used to bypass authentication. Take a moment and see if you can spot the bug as well.

If you can spot the bug, congratulations! You should consider finding bugs and submitting to our program ☺. The bug in the patch lies in the first few lines of the function. If the attacker URL encodes the ".." characters in the URL, it will trick the function into returning early. In other words, the attacker can simply use `/imc/primepush/%2e%2e/<target URI>` to bypass the patch!

By URL encoding the path traversal characters, the attacker can bypass the URL access controller only. The attacker may then be able to view certain authentication protected pages. From here, an attacker may use [ZDI-18-136](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-18-136/) to hijack an admin session, or continue with any of the following Expression Language (EL) injection bugs that exist in this product to gain code execution:

**What exactly is Expression Language injection? -- A Primer**

Expression Language (EL) is part of the web application UI framework known as Java Server Faces (JSF). [Here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsf/jsf_expression_language.htm) is a quick example of how EL works in the JSF framework. The Expression Language injection [CWE-917](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/917.html) is a relatively young vulnerability class. Little literature is available for this bug class outside of the [initial work](https://www.mindedsecurity.com/fileshare/ExpressionLanguageInjection.pdf) done by Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security and Arshan Dabirsiaghi of Aspect Security plus a handful of blog posts.

One of the first EL injection bugs dates back to 2011. [CVE-2011-2730](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-2730) covers a double-evaluation bug in Spring Framework that results in information disclosure. Later in 2012, [Dan Amodio](https://twitter.com/DanAmodio) demonstrated a new technique of exploiting EL injection bugs in newer JSP/EL 2.2 to achieve code execution in this [blog post](http://danamodio.com/appsec/research/spring-remote-code-with-expression-language-injection/). This new technique does not require the vulnerable code to evaluate the attacker-controlled expressions twice.

**ZDI-17-663: Anatomy of EL injection vulnerability**

ZDI-17-663 is a post-auth EL injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Expression Language through the `beanName` parameter passed to `ictExpertDownload.xhtml`. Let's begin by examining the entry point of the vulnerability -- the view template stored in `C:\Program Files\iMC\client\web\apps\imc\ict\export\ictExpertDownload.xhtml`:

In the highlight [1] above, the "<http://www.huawei-3com.com/jsf/core>" namespace is imported, which includes a number of custom tags. One of these is the `imcf:beanMethod` tag. Whenever this page is requested, the `imcf:beanMethod` tag seen at [2] invokes the `initPage` method of the `ictTableExportBean`. This behavior is documented in the taglib definition located at `C:\Program Files\iMC\client\web\apps\imc\WEB-INF\imc-jsf-core.taglib.xml`:

Let's take a look at what `ictTableExportBean.initPage()` does next. This method is defined in the `com.h3c.imc.ict.export.view.IctTableExportBean` class of `imcweb_plat.jar`:

The highlight at [4] is not quite where the EL gets evaluated; instead the attacker-controlled data is passed to `FacesUtils` class, which actually evaluates the expression. Following is the decompiled `FaceUtils` class:

`com.h3c.imc.common.faces.FacesUtils.java`:

Here, the attacker-controlled data is parsed into a `ValueExpression` and ultimately evaluated. Since the web server is running as SYSTEM, the malicious payload will be executed as SYSTEM as well.

**Putting it all together: Gaining SYSTEM with EL injection**

Today, we are releasing a [Metasploit module](https://github.com/thezdi/scripts/blob/master/msf/hp_imc_el_injection_rce.rb) that utilizes ZDI-18-139 and ZDI-17-663 to exploit IMC. This module has been tested against iMC7.3E0504P2 with the `cmd/windows/powershell_reverse` payload. The payload of this Metasploit module is taken from the original bug submission, and a detailed explanation of how the payload works can be found here.

Here’s a video of the Metasploit module in action:

**Conclusion**

The information disclosure and code execution bugs listed here demonstrate why developers should still sanitize program inputs, even if they come from allegedly “safe” spaces. It also shows how post-authentication bugs can still be used by attackers and penetration testers alike. EL injection bugs are rarely discovered partly due to their hard-to-find-by-blackbox-approach nature. It is almost absolutely necessary to have source code access to find these EL injection bugs. Hopefully, this class of bugs will be eradicated as quickly as format string vulnerabilities did once they reach a critical level of popularity in our industry.
