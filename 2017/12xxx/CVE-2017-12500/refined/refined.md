```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an incomplete patch for a previous path traversal issue. The fix introduced a `normalizeSyntax()` function to sanitize URL paths containing \"..\", but this function could be bypassed by URL encoding the \"..\" sequence as \"%2e%2e\". This allows an attacker to bypass the URL access controller and reach other servlets.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication bypass due to insufficient path sanitization.",
    "Expression Language (EL) injection vulnerability in the `beanName` parameter of `ictExpertDownload.xhtml`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM on the affected server.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server. This request includes a URL that exploits the path traversal vulnerability by using URL-encoded \"..\" sequences and an EL injection payload in the `beanName` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No prior authentication or special positioning is required."
