- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the processing of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) ingress frames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of EAP frames can lead to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way Cisco Aironet access points process EAP ingress frames.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the access point to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This effectively disrupts network services for connected clients.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by an unauthenticated, Layer 2 radio frequency (RF) adjacent attacker, meaning the attacker needs to be within radio range of the vulnerable access point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within RF range of the vulnerable access point and does not require any authentication or special privileges.

The provided content offers more detail than the typical CVE description by specifying the affected products (Cisco Aironet 1560, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points), the attack vector, and the impact (a reload/DoS). It also provides guidance on how to determine the software version and which software releases are affected and contain fixes.
