```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `mdjvu_bitmap_pack_row` function in `base/4bitmap.c` attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer when processing a crafted DjVu file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Out-of-bounds read: The `mdjvu_bitmap_pack_row` function attempts to read from a memory location pointed to by `bytes`, which is outside the allocated buffer.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service: The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and application crash due to an invalid memory access.

Attack vectors:
- Malicious DjVu file: The vulnerability is triggered by loading a specially crafted DjVu file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DjVu file to the vulnerable application.
