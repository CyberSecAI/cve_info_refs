The GNU C Library is used as *the* C library in the GNU system and in GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel.  The GNU C Library is primarily designed to be a portable and high performance C library.  It follows all relevant standards including ISO C11 and POSIX.1-2008.  It is also internationalized and has one of the most complete internationalization interfaces known.  The GNU C Library webpage is at <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>  Packages for the 2.26 release may be downloaded from:         <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libc/>         <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/>  The mirror list is at <http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>  NEWS for version 2.26 =====================  Major new features:  * A per-thread cache has been added to malloc. Access to the cache requires   no locks and therefore significantly accelerates the fast path to allocate   and free small amounts of memory. Refilling an empty cache requires locking   the underlying arena. Performance measurements show significant gains in a   wide variety of user workloads. Workloads were captured using a special   instrumented malloc and analyzed with a malloc simulator. Contributed by   DJ Delorie with the help of Florian Weimer, and Carlos O'Donell.  * Unicode 10.0.0 Support: Character encoding, character type info, and   transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 10.0.0, using   generator scripts contributed by Mike FABIAN (Red Hat).   These updates cause user visible changes, especially the changes in   wcwidth for many emoji characters cause problems when emoji sequences   are rendered with pango, see for example:   <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=780669#c5>  * Collation of Hungarian has been overhauled and is now consistent with "The   Rules of Hungarian Orthography, 12th edition" ([Bug 18934](show_bug.cgi?id=18934 "RESOLVED FIXED - hu_HU: collate: fix multiple bugs and add tests")).  Contributed by   Egmont Koblinger.  * Improvements to the DNS stub resolver, contributed by Florian Weimer:    - The GNU C Library will now detect when /etc/resolv.conf has been     modified and reload the changed configuration.  The new resolver option     “no-reload” (RES_NORELOAD) disables this behavior.    - The GNU C Library now supports an arbitrary number of search domains     (configured using the “search” directive in /etc/resolv.conf);     previously, there was a hard limit of six domains.  For backward     compatibility, applications that directly modify the ‘_res’ global     object are still limited to six search domains.    - When the “rotate” (RES_ROTATE) resolver option is active, the GNU C     Library will now randomly pick a name server from the configuration as a     starting point.  (Previously, the second name server was always used.)  * The tunables feature is now enabled by default.  This allows users to tweak   behavior of the GNU C Library using the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable.  * New function reallocarray, which resizes an allocated block (like realloc)   to the product of two sizes, with a guaranteed clean failure upon integer   overflow in the multiplication.  Originally from OpenBSD, contributed by   Dennis Wölfing and Rüdiger Sonderfeld.  * New wrappers for the Linux-specific system calls preadv2 and pwritev2.   These are extended versions of preadv and pwritev, respectively, taking an   additional flags argument.  The set of supported flags depends on the   running kernel; full support currently requires kernel 4.7 or later.  * posix_spawnattr_setflags now supports the flag POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID, to   create a new session ID for the spawned process.  This feature is   scheduled to be added to the next major revision of POSIX; for the time   being, it is available under _GNU_SOURCE.  * errno.h is now safe to use from C-preprocessed assembly language on all   supported operating systems.  In this context, it will only define the   Exxxx constants, as preprocessor macros expanding to integer literals.  * On ia64, powerpc64le, x86-32, and x86-64, the math library now implements   128-bit floating point as defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (IEEE   754-2008) and ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015.  Contributed by Paul E. Murphy,   Gabriel F. T. Gomes, Tulio Magno Quites Machado Filho, and Joseph Myers.    To compile programs that use this feature, the compiler must support   128-bit floating point with the type name _Float128 (as defined by TS   18661-3) or __float128 (the nonstandard name used by GCC for C++, and for   C prior to version 7).  _GNU_SOURCE or __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__   must be defined to make the new interfaces visible.    The new functions and macros correspond to those present for other   floating-point types (except for a few obsolescent interfaces not   supported for the new type), with F128 or f128 suffixes; for example,   strtof128, HUGE_VAL_F128 and cosf128.  Following TS 18661-3, there are no   printf or scanf formats for the new type; the strfromf128 and strtof128   interfaces should be used instead.  Deprecated and removed features, and other changes affecting compatibility:  * The synchronization that pthread_spin_unlock performs has been changed to   now be equivalent to a C11 atomic store with release memory order to the   spin lock's memory location.  Previously, several (but not all)   architectures used stronger synchronization (e.g., containing what is   often called a full barrier).  This change can improve performance, but   may affect odd fringe uses of spin locks that depend on the previous   behavior (e.g., using spin locks as atomic variables to try to implement   Dekker's mutual exclusion algorithm).  * The port to Native Client running on ARMv7-A (--host=arm-nacl) has been   removed.  * Sun RPC is deprecated.  The rpcgen program, librpcsvc, and Sun RPC headers   will only be built and installed when the GNU C Library is configured with   --enable-obsolete-rpc.  This allows alternative RPC implementations, such   as TIRPC or rpcsvc-proto, to be used.  * The NIS(+) name service modules, libnss_nis, libnss_nisplus, and   libnss_compat, are deprecated, and will not be built or installed by   default.    The NIS(+) support library, libnsl, is also deprecated.  By default, a   compatibility shared library will be built and installed, but not headers   or development libraries. Only a few NIS-related programs require this   library.  (In particular, the GNU C Library has never required programs   that use 'gethostbyname' to be linked with libnsl.)    Replacement implementations based on TIRPC, which additionally support   IPv6, are available from <<https://github.com/thkukuk/>>.  The configure   option --enable-obsolete-nsl will cause libnsl's headers, and the NIS(+)   name service modules, to be built and installed.  * The DNS stub resolver no longer performs EDNS fallback.  If EDNS or DNSSEC   support is enabled, the configured recursive resolver must support EDNS.   (Responding to EDNS-enabled queries with responses which are not   EDNS-enabled is fine, but FORMERR responses are not.)  * res_mkquery and res_nmkquery no longer support the IQUERY opcode.  DNS   servers have not supported this opcode for a long time.  * The _res_opcodes variable has been removed from libresolv.  It had been   exported by accident.  * <string.h> no longer includes inline versions of any string functions,   as this kind of optimization is better done by the compiler.  The macros   __USE_STRING_INLINES and __NO_STRING_INLINES no longer have any effect.  * The nonstandard header <xlocale.h> has been removed.  Most programs should   use <locale.h> instead.  If you have a specific need for the definition of   locale_t with no other declarations, please contact   libc-alpha@sourceware.org and explain.  * The obsolete header <sys/ultrasound.h> has been removed.  * The obsolete signal constant SIGUNUSED is no longer defined by <signal.h>.  * The obsolete function cfree has been removed.  Applications should use   free instead.  * The stack_t type no longer has the name struct sigaltstack.  This changes   the C++ name mangling for interfaces involving this type.  * The ucontext_t type no longer has the name struct ucontext.  This changes   the C++ name mangling for interfaces involving this type.  * On M68k GNU/Linux and MIPS GNU/Linux, the fpregset_t type no longer has   the name struct fpregset.  On Nios II GNU/Linux, the mcontext_t type no   longer has the name struct mcontext.  On SPARC GNU/Linux, the struct   mc_fq, struct rwindow, struct fpq and struct fq types are no longer   defined in sys/ucontext.h, the mc_fpu_t type no longer has the name struct   mc_fpu, the gwindows_t type no longer has the name struct gwindows and the   fpregset_t type no longer has the name struct fpu.  This changes the C++   name mangling for interfaces involving those types.  * On S/390 GNU/Linux, the constants defined by <sys/ptrace.h> have been   synced with the kernel:      - PTRACE_GETREGS, PTRACE_SETREGS, PTRACE_GETFPREGS and PTRACE_SETFPREGS       are not supported on this architecture and have been removed.      - PTRACE_SINGLEBLOCK, PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER, PTRACE_PEEKUSR_AREA,       PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA, PTRACE_GET_LAST_BREAK, PTRACE_ENABLE_TE,       PTRACE_DISABLE_TE and PTRACE_TE_ABORT_RAND have been added.    Programs that assume the GET/SETREGS ptrace requests are universally   available will now fail to build, instead of malfunctioning at runtime.  Changes to build and runtime requirements:  * Linux kernel 3.2 or later is required at runtime, on all architectures   supported by that kernel.  (This is a change from version 2.25 only for   x86-32 and x86-64.)  * GNU Binutils 2.25 or later is now required to build the GNU C Library.  * On most architectures, GCC 4.9 or later is required to build the GNU C   Library.  On powerpc64le, GCC 6.2 or later is required.    Older GCC versions and non-GNU compilers are still supported when   compiling programs that use the GNU C Library.  (We do not know exactly   how old, and some GNU extensions to C may be _de facto_ required.  If you   are interested in helping us make this statement less vague, please   contact libc-alpha@sourceware.org.)  Security related changes:  * The DNS stub resolver limits the advertised UDP buffer size to 1200 bytes,   to avoid fragmentation-based spoofing attacks (CVE-2017-12132).  * LD_LIBRARY_PATH is now ignored in binaries running in privileged AT_SECURE   mode to guard against local privilege escalation attacks (CVE-2017-1000366).  * Avoid printing a backtrace from the __stack_chk_fail function since it is   called on a corrupt stack and a backtrace is unreliable on a corrupt stack   (CVE-2010-3192).  * A use-after-free vulnerability in clntudp_call in the Sun RPC system has been   fixed (CVE-2017-12133).

The test case must be run under a heap debugger such as valgrind     to observe the invalid access.  A malloc implementation which     immediately calls munmap on free would catch this bug as well.

In this case, an integer overflow in _int_malloc leads     to posix_memalign incorrectly returning successfully.          Upon fixing this and writing a somewhat thorough regression test, it was     discovered that when posix_memalign is called with an alignment larger than     MALLOC_ALIGNMENT (so it uses _int_memalign instead) and a requested size     close to SIZE_MAX, a different integer overflow in _int_memalign leads to     posix_memalign incorrectly returning successfully.          Both integer overflows affect other memory allocation functions that use     _int_malloc (one affected malloc in x86) or _int_memalign as well.          This commit fixes both integer overflows.  In addition to this, it adds a     regression test to guard against false successful allocations by the     following memory allocation functions when called with too-large allocation     sizes and, where relevant, various valid alignments:     malloc, realloc, calloc, reallocarray, memalign, posix_memalign,     aligned_alloc, valloc, and pvalloc.

In practice the check for empty token is done *after* the     dynamic string token expansion. The expansion process can return an     empty string for the $ORIGIN token if __libc_enable_secure is set     or if the path of the binary can not be determined (/proc not mounted).          Fix that by moving the check for empty tokens before the dynamic string     token expansion. In addition, check for NULL pointer or empty strings     return by expand_dynamic_string_token.          The above changes highlighted a bug in decompose_rpath, an empty array     is represented by the first element being NULL at the fillin_rpath     level, but by using a -1 pointer in decompose_rpath and other functions.          Changelog:     	[BZ #22625]     	* elf/dl-load.c (fillin_rpath): Check for empty tokens before dynamic     	string token expansion. Check for NULL pointer or empty string possibly     	returned by expand_dynamic_string_token.     	(decompose_rpath): Check for empty path after dynamic string     	token expansion.

The test case must be run under a heap debugger such as valgrind     to observe the invalid access.  A malloc implementation which     immediately calls munmap on free would catch this bug as well.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2017-270ab2baa3
2017-09-04 16:15:28.319959
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 25
Version : 2.24
Release : 10.fc25
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update fixes a minor security vulnerability in the Sun RPC client
(CVE-2017-12133).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
References:

[ 1 ] Bug #1478289 - CVE-2017-12133 glibc: Use-after-free read access in clntudp\_call in sunrpc [fedora-all]
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1478289>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update can be installed with the "dnf" update program. Use
su -c 'dnf upgrade glibc' at the command line.
For more information, refer to the dnf documentation available at
<http://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#upgrade-command-label>

All packages are signed with the Fedora Project GPG key. More details on the
GPG keys used by the Fedora Project can be found at
<https://fedoraproject.org/keys>
