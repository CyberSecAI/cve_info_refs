Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input filtering in the web management interface of the PLANEX CS-W50HD device. Specifically, the parameters sent to the `/cgi-bin/nasset.cgi` page during NAS settings configuration are not sanitized correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:**  An attacker can inject malicious commands into the vulnerable input parameters. These commands are executed with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** A crafted HTTP POST request is sent to the `/cgi-bin/nasset.cgi` page. This request contains the malicious commands in the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web management interface, meaning network access to the device.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the web management interface before they can execute the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in firmware version 030608 of the PLANEX CS-W50HD.
- The issue was resolved in firmware version 030720.
- The attacker can inject commands using escaped characters or eval functions.
