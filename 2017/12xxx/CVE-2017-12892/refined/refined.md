{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to validate the cPath parameter in the saveAs method and is thus forced to write to the Startup folder with an .hta file that can execute arbitrary code after a restart.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Arbitrary Code Execution"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to induce users to execute commands with malicious parameters.",
      "Attack vectors": [
         "Executing certain JavaScripts in PDF files"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF document and convince the victim to open it."
    },
       {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly validate the certificate of the updater executable or fails to lock the permissions of the update file after certificate validation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition",
        "Privilege Escalation"
      ],
     "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to carry out privilege escalation attacks by replacing the update file with a malicious one.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Replacing the update file with a malicious one during update process"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to perform file system modifications."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application has a default selected 'OK' button within the security warning dialog when opening PDFs with 'Launch File' actions, which may cause users to habitually click “OK” without understanding the potential risks involved.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "User deception",
        "Harmful command execution"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to deceive users into executing harmful commands.",
