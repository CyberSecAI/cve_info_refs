Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-12987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a buffer over-read vulnerability within the `parse_elements()` function in the `print-802_11.c` file, specifically when parsing IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) frames. This likely stems from incorrect handling of the "TIM IE" (Traffic Indication Map Information Element) length field, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Over-Read:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer over-read. The `memcpy()` operation reads more data than available, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure. Specifically, the size argument for the memcpy is incorrect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a crash by sending a specially crafted 802.11 frame.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the extracted text, a buffer over-read can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution under some conditions. This is mentioned in the Gentoo advisory.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The over-read might expose sensitive information in memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is primarily **network-based**. The vulnerability can be triggered by receiving a malicious 802.11 frame.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject or send crafted IEEE 802.11 frames.  This suggests the attacker would need to be in range of a wireless network to send the malformed packets.
*   No specific privileges or user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
*  The fix involves correcting the size argument to memcpy() in the vulnerable code location, which was fixed in tcpdump version 4.9.2.
*   The vulnerability is present in tcpdump versions before 4.9.2.
* Several sources mention the work of "Kamil Frankowicz" in discovering the vulnerability and providing a PCAP for testing.
*   The fix included a new test using a capture file provided by Brian 'geeknik' Carpenter.

The provided content gives a clear picture of a buffer over-read in the IEEE 802.11 parser of tcpdump, which can be exploited by a remote attacker. The fix involves a correction to memcpy usage.
