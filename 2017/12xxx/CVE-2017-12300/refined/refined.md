Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software. Specifically, a flaw allows an attacker to bypass file policies designed to block the Server Message Block Version 2 (SMB2) protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File Policy Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to circumvent configured file policies intended to block SMB2 traffic.
*   **Input Validation Error:** (Implied) The vulnerability likely stems from an error in how the software processes or validates SMB2 traffic, leading to the bypass. While not explicitly stated, CWE-20 suggests improper input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Integrity Impact:**  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass configured file policies, potentially leading to unauthorized file access or transfer. This is categorized as a low impact on integrity. The provided CVSS vector string shows "I:L" which means low integrity impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network, as indicated by "AV:N".
*   **Unauthenticated:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability, as specified by "PR:N" (no privileges required) and "UI:N" (no user interaction required).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco Firepower system.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user action is required for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Cisco Firepower System Software (specifically, SNORT is affected).
*   **Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than applying the fix.
*   **Exploitation:** Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
