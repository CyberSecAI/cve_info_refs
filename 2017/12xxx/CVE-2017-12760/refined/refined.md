{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'url' parameter when handling requests to the myCampaign and newSMSCampaign pages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of application data, or complete control of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests with malicious SQL code in the 'url' parameter.",
   "Example:  `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?url=myCampaign&view=[SQL]`",
   "Example:  `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?url=newSMSCampaign&use=[SQL]`"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, they also need to have a client account to log into the application."
