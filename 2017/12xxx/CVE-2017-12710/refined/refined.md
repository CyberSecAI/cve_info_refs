Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-12710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation before using a remotely supplied string to construct SQL queries. Specifically, the `templateName` parameter in `rmTemplate.aspx` is not sanitized before being used in a SQL `DELETE` query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  A specially crafted `templateName` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the vulnerability to disclose sensitive information, including administrative account passwords used by Advantech WebAccess.
*   The vulnerability can be combined with an authentication bypass to achieve unauthenticated remote access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `rmTemplate.aspx` page.
*   **Unauthenticated access (when combined with authentication bypass)**: An attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms, combine it with the SQLi, and gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected system.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** While authentication is required, the content indicates that this can be bypassed.
*   **Knowledge of the Application:** An understanding of how the application handles requests is necessary to craft the SQL injection payload.
