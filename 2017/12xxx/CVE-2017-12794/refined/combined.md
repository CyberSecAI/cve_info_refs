## Django security releases issued: 1.11.5 and 1.10.8

Posted by **Tim Graham** on Sept. 5, 2017

In accordance with [our security release policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/), the Django team is issuing [Django 1.11.5](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.11.5/) and [Django 1.10.8](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.10.8/). These release addresses the security issue detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.

### CVE-2017-12794: Possible XSS in traceback section of technical 500 debug page

In older versions, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template
for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed
a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most
production sites since you shouldn't run with DEBUG = True (which makes
this page accessible) in your production settings.

Thanks Charles Bideau for reporting this issue.

### Affected supported versions

* Django master development branch
* Django 1.11
* Django 1.10

Per our [supported versions policy](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions), Django 1.9 is no longer supported. Django 1.8 is unaffected.

### Resolution

Patches to resolve the issues have been applied to Django's master development branch and
the 1.11 and 1.10 release branches. The patches may be obtained from the following changesets:

* On the [development master branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/46e2b9e059e617afe6fe56da9f132568a7e6b198)
* On the [1.11 release branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/e35a0c56086924f331e9422daa266e907a4784cc)
* On the [1.10 release branch](https://github.com/django/django/commit/58e08e80e362db79eb0fd775dc81faad90dca47a)

The following releases have been issued:

* Django 1.11.5 ([download Django 1.11.5](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.11/Django-1.11.5.tar.gz) | [1.11.5 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.11.5.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.10.8 ([download Django 1.10.8](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.10/Django-1.10.8.tar.gz) | [1.10.8 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.10.8.checksum.txt))

The PGP key ID used for these releases is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.

### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's
Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see [our security
policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/) for further
information.

# Django 1.10.8 release notes[¶](#django-1-10-8-release-notes "Link to this heading")

*September 5, 2017*

Django 1.10.8 fixes a security issue in 1.10.7.

## CVE-2017-12794: Possible XSS in traceback section of technical 500 debug page[¶](#cve-2017-12794-possible-xss-in-traceback-section-of-technical-500-debug-page "Link to this heading")

In older versions, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template
for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed
a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn’t affect most
production sites since you shouldn’t run with `DEBUG = True` (which makes
this page accessible) in your production settings.
