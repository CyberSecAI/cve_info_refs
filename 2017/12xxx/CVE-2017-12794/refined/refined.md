Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-12794:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper HTML escaping in the technical 500 debug page's template.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, leading to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to trigger a 500 error on the Django application when `DEBUG = True`. This will cause the vulnerable debug page to be rendered.
- Then the attacker needs to craft a specific input that will be included in the traceback which is not properly escaped and thus can execute malicious Javascript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Django application, and must be able to trigger a 500 error.
- The targeted Django application must be in debug mode (`DEBUG = True`), which should not be enabled in production environments.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the traceback section of the technical 500 debug page.
- This vulnerability is less likely to affect production environments because the debug page is only accessible when `DEBUG = True`.
- Patches were issued for Django versions 1.11 and 1.10 to address this issue.
