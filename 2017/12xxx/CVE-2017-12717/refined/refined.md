Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-12717:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element: The application does not properly control the search path used to locate and load DLL files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the application's use of an uncontrolled search path when loading DLLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the application. This could lead to a compromise of the application's functionality and potentially other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file earlier in the search path than the legitimate DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable application is installed.
- The attacker requires the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will search for it.
- User interaction is required, as the application must be executed and attempt to load the malicious DLL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that a malicious DLL file placed earlier in the search path may allow an attacker to execute code within the context of the application.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.8, with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L). This indicates that the attack is local, requires low privileges, user interaction, and has a low impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- The advisory states that there are no known public exploits that specifically target this vulnerability.
