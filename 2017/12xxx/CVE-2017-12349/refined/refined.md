Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-12349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the affected Cisco UCS Central Software does not assign a new session ID when a user authenticates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The software fails to generate a new session ID upon successful authentication, allowing an attacker to potentially hijack a session by using a previously acquired session ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session. This would grant the attacker the same privileges as the compromised user, allowing them to perform actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to authenticate to acquire a session ID. However, they do need to obtain a valid session ID from a legitimate user.
*   **Web-based Interface:** The vulnerability is present in the session management functionality of the web-based management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Obtain a valid session ID:** An attacker must obtain a valid session ID. The advisory does not specify how an attacker would obtain a valid session ID, but it indicates that it can be hijacked.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected software to exploit the vulnerability.
