Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the relevant vulnerability information:

**CVE-2017-12639**: The document mentions the fix for "Several buffer overflow exploits known as ETRE and ETCETERABLUE" in the "List Server" component.

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities existed in the List Server component of IMail Server. These are specifically identified as ETRE and ETCETERABLUE.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Buffer overflow. This occurs when a program tries to write data beyond the allocated buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of exploitation**:
-  Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior. Since the specific nature of the overflow is not mentioned, the precise impact cannot be determined with certainty but arbitrary code execution or denial of service is likely.

**Attack vectors**:
- The attack vector is through the List Server component of IMail Server. This suggests that a malicious user or attacker could craft specific requests to the List Server that triggers the overflow during its processing. It can be accessed via network since IMail server is supposed to serve network requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the List Server. This might mean being an authenticated user of the system or, if the vulnerability was present in an unauthenticated part of the List Server, being able to send crafted network packets to the service.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerability in the List server and the ability to craft the exploit payload

**Additional Notes:**
- The document doesn't provide detailed technical information regarding these vulnerabilities.
- The document references "Mongo from bugcrowd" who reported the vulnerability. This indicates that the vulnerability was found and reported by an external security researcher.
