- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SCADA MicroBrowser software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to gain access to the system, manipulate system files, and potentially render the system unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a maliciously crafted HTML file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious HTML file to the vulnerable system. No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.  The attack is remotely exploitable, and requires low skill to exploit.
