{
  "CVE-2017-12932": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper use of the hash API for key deletion in the `var_unserializer.re` component when an invalid array size is encountered during deserialization of untrusted data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation of this issue can lead to an unspecified impact on the integrity of PHP.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the unserialization of untrusted data. An attacker would need to provide malicious serialized data to a PHP application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide malicious, crafted input to the unserialize() function in order to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "CVE-2017-12933": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `finish_nested_data` function in `var_unserializer.re`, which is prone to a buffer over-read while unserializing untrusted data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read"
     ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation of this issue can lead to an unspecified impact on the integrity of PHP.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by supplying crafted, untrusted serialized data to the unserialize() function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide specially crafted data to the unserialize() function."
  },
 "CVE-2017-16642": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an error in the date extension's `timelib_meridian` handling of 'front of' and 'back of' directives that could lead to out-of-bounds reads in the php_parse_date function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "This issue can potentially lead to information disclosure from the interpreter.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to supply specially crafted date strings to a PHP application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or manipulate the date strings that are processed."
