    escalation, denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2017-10919

    Julien Grall discovered that that incorrect handling of
    virtual interrupt injection on ARM systems may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2017-10920 / CVE-2017-10921 / CVE-2017-10922

    Jan Beulich discovered multiple places where reference
    counting on grant table operations was incorrect, resulting
    in potential privilege escalation

CVE-2017-12135

    Jan Beulich found multiple problems in the handling of
    transitive grants which could result in denial of service
    and potentially privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12136

    Ian Jackson discovered that race conditions in the allocator
    for grant mappings may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation. This only affects Debian stretch.

CVE-2017-12137

    Andrew Cooper discovered that incorrect validation of
    grants may result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12855

    Jan Beulich discovered that incorrect grant status handling, thus
    incorrectly informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use.

XSA-235 (no CVE yet)

    Wei Liu discovered that incorrect locking of add-to-physmap
    operations on ARM may result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.4.1-9+deb8u10.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.1-1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2017-12855 / XSA-230
                              version 3

 grant_table: possibly premature clearing of GTF_writing / GTF_reading

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Xen maintains the _GTF_{read,writ}ing bits as appropriate, to inform the
guest that a grant is in use.  A guest is expected not to modify the
grant details while it is in use, whereas the guest is free to
modify/reuse the grant entry when it is not in use.

Under some circumstances, Xen will clear the status bits too early,
incorrectly informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use.

IMPACT
======

A guest may prematurely believe that a granted frame is safely private
again, and reuse it in a way which contains sensitive information, while
the domain on the far end of the grant is still using the grant.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
  <http://www.xenproject.org/security-policy.html>

NOTE REGARDING SHORT EMBARGO
============================

This issue was discovered while investigating problems with the initial
version of XSA-226.  Accordingly, XSA-230 is embargoed and the embargo
will end at the same time as that of XSA-226.
