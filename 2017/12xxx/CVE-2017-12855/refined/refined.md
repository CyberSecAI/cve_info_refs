Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect grant status handling within the Xen hypervisor. Specifically, Xen might prematurely clear the `GTF_writing` and `GTF_reading` bits associated with a grant. These bits are meant to indicate to a guest domain whether a grant is currently in use by another domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Grant Status Reporting:** The core issue is that Xen incorrectly informs a guest that a grant is no longer in use when it actually is.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Premature Reuse of Granted Frame:** A guest domain might prematurely believe that a granted frame is safe to reuse.
*   **Information Leak:** If the guest reuses a frame while the granting domain is still using it, sensitive information residing in the frame could be exposed or overwritten.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest Domain:** A malicious or compromised guest domain could trigger this vulnerability by interacting with grants in a specific way. The guest needs to be granted a frame by a peer domain.
*   **Grant Table Operations:** The vulnerability is related to the way Xen manages the grant table and its flags related to writing and reading.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest Domain Access:** An attacker needs to have control of a guest domain in order to exploit this vulnerability. This guest domain should be involved in grant operations where it is either granting or receiving access to shared memory.
*   **Knowledge of Grant Table Mechanics:**  The attacker needs to be aware of how Xen's grant mechanism works in order to trigger the premature clearing of the flags related to grant usage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that all systems are vulnerable.
*   There are no mitigations other than applying the provided patch.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.
*   This issue was discovered while investigating problems with the initial version of XSA-226.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the GTF_reading/GTF_writing bits are cleared correctly.
