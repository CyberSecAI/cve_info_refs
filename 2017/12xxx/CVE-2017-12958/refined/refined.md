Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An illegal memory access occurs in the `output_hex()` function within the libpspp library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The `output_hex()` function attempts to write to a memory location outside of the allocated buffer, leading to a segmentation fault. This is evident in the provided GDB output where `*output++` accesses an invalid memory address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a crash of the `pspp-convert` utility due to the segmentation fault. This can lead to a denial-of-service scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted input file using `pspp-convert`. Specifically, the provided example uses the command: `./pspp-convert POC3 -O csv /dev/null`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute the `pspp-convert` utility with a malicious input file. This may involve local access or the ability to supply the malicious file to the application if it's processing user-provided files.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The bug report identifies the specific file and line of the vulnerability: `src/data/data-out.c:1167` in function `output_hex()`.
- The vulnerability was discovered using a custom fuzzer called `collAFL`.
- The vulnerability was addressed in `pspp` version 1.0.1.
- The crash occurs when converting a file to CSV format.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `pspp` prior to 1.0.1.
- The affected function `output_hex` is used in the process of generating output.
