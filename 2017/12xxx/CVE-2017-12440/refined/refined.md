{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A verification flaw in openstack-aodh allowed a user to pass in an arbitrary trust ID as part of an HTTP alarm action. This trust ID was then used by openstack-aodh to obtain a keystone token without verifying if the user was authorized to use the trust.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient verification of trust IDs, leading to unauthorized access via delegated authority.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user could pass in another person's trust ID and obtain a keystone token containing the delegated authority of that user. This could enable the attacker to perform unauthorized actions with the privileges of the victim.",
  "Attack vectors": "By adding an alarm action with the scheme `trust+http:` and providing a trust ID.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated user with the ability to create alarm actions and knowledge of another user's trust ID. No special privileges are required."
