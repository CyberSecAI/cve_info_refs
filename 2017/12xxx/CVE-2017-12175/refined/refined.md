Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2017-12175:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the discovery rule filter autocomplete functionality of Red Hat Satellite 6.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the presence of XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web page
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
  - Stealing sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves the discovery rule filter field, specifically when using the autocomplete functionality. An attacker could inject malicious script through this input field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the discovery rule filter field. This implies the attacker must have access to the Red Hat Satellite 6 interface and the ability to create or edit discovery rules.
- No special privileges other than user with access to modify discovery rules appear to be required.
