| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software that is running on the following Cisco products:   + ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Firepower 4110 Security Appliance   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + ISA 3000 Industrial Security Appliance   For information about which software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory.      This vulnerability affects devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software and have direct authentication enabled. The vulnerability only applies to HTTP access over the web management interface, telnet access with direct authentication is not vulnerable.         **Direct Authentication**      To determine whether direct authentication is enabled, administrators can use the **show running-config | include aaa authentication listener** command in the CLI and verify that the command returns output.      The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software and has direct authentication enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config | include aaa authentication listener   aaa authentication listener http inside port 5555   ``` For additional information, refer to the configuration example in the Direct Authentication section of the [Cut-Through and Direct ASA Authentication Configuration Example](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/113363-asa-cut-through-config-00.html#direct-auth) document.       **Determining the Running Software Release** To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the **show version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release **9.2(1)**:  ```   ciscoasa# show version | include Version   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1)    Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ```  Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco platforms:   + Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance   + Firepower Threat Defense Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html> Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.      **Fixed Releases**In the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco ASA Software. The right column indicates whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section.       | **Cisco ASA Major Release** | **First Fixed Release** |   | --- | --- |   | Prior to 9.11 | Affected, migrate to 9.1.7.17 or later |   | 9.1 | 9.1.7.17 or later |   | 9.2 | 9.2.4.20 or later |   | 9.31 | Affected, migrate to 9.4.4.6 |   | 9.4 | 9.4.4.6 or later |   | 9.51 | 9.5.3.9 or later |   | 9.6 | 9.6.3 or later |   | 9.7 | 9.7.1.8 or later |   | 9.8 | 9.8.1 or later |       1Cisco ASA Software releases prior to 9.1 and Cisco ASA releases 9.3 and 9.5 have reached End of Software Maintenance.
