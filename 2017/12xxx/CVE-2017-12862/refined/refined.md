Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12862:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow within the `cv::PxMDecoder::readData` function in `grfmt_pxm.cpp`. This occurs when the allocated buffer (`_src`) is smaller than required by the data being read, specifically when the image width (`m_width`) is significantly larger than the calculated pitch (`src_pitch`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: A buffer on the heap is overflowed when writing image data, due to incorrect size calculation for the buffer. The size of the buffer is calculated using `src_pitch`, while data is being written based on `m_width`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The heap overflow can cause a crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition,
- Memory corruption: The vulnerability could potentially lead to more severe consequences such as arbitrary code execution via memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is triggered by loading a specially crafted image file (PXM format) using `cv::imread()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PXM image to a vulnerable application using the OpenCV library.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenCV versions from 2.2 to 3.3.
- The provided source code snippet shows the line of code within `grfmt_pxm.cpp` where the overflow occurs when `src[x]` is written.
- The provided `gdb` output shows that `m_width` is indeed significantly larger than `src_pitch`.
- Debian LTS advisories (DLA 1438-1, DLA 2799-1) list CVE-2017-12862 as a vulnerability addressed in their updates.
- Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201712-02) also lists CVE-2017-12862 as a vulnerability in OpenCV.
