The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12098.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating custom filters in the rails_admin gem. Specifically, the application does not neutralize or encode the input used to construct URLs, leading to the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization.
- The application directly uses user-provided input in the URL without encoding or validation, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an authenticated user's browser. This can result in:
- Session hijacking.
- Information disclosure.
- Defacement of the application.
- Other malicious activities, depending on the context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker then phishes an authenticated user, tricking them into visiting the malicious URL.
- When the user accesses the URL, the malicious JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileged access to the application.
- The attacker only needs to construct the malicious URL and phish an authenticated user to visit it.
