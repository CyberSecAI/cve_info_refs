- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in `file_upload.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied URLs, allowing an attacker to control the target of an internal request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows remote authenticated users to download arbitrary local files.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to `file_upload.php` with a malicious URL parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user.
