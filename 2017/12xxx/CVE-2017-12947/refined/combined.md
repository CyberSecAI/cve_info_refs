Сегодня при переустановки CMS WP, плагин начал очень хорошо кушать ресурсы (10+сек ожидания). Решил не заморачиваться и поискать аналоги этого плагина с более свежей поддержкой CMS+плагина.

Очень сырой плагин, давно не обновлялся.
Раз от раза, при открытии, модальное окно не центрируется по области экрана.
Не рекомендую.
