- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple buffer overflow exploits, known as ETRE and ETCETERABLUE, were present in the List Server component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the List Server component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could lead to unspecified malicious activity (buffer overflow), but it is not described further in the release notes
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities are in the List Server component, suggesting network-based attack vectors through interactions with the List Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the List Server to exploit the buffer overflows.
