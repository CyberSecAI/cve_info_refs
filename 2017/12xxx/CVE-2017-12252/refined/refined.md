Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-12252

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a DLL preloading issue within the Cisco FindIT Network Discovery Utility.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **DLL Preloading:** The application is susceptible to a DLL preloading attack, where a malicious DLL can be loaded instead of a legitimate one. This happens when the application loads DLLs from insecure paths, potentially allowing an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL that will be loaded by the application.
*   **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):** The provided information identifies CWE-20 as being related to this issue. This implies that the software does not properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files, and thus allows the loading of malicious DLLs from insecure locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Partial Loss of Availability:**  The vulnerability can lead to partial disruption of the device's availability, meaning certain services might be affected or made unavailable.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exploitation could result in unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** The attacker may be able to manipulate or alter data on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be local to the system running the vulnerable software.
*   **DLL Preloading:** An attacker crafts a malicious DLL and places it in a location where the vulnerable application will load it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Local Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the system where the Cisco FindIT Network Discovery Utility is installed and running, and be on the local system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no known workarounds to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported externally to Cisco by Kushal Arvind Shah of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
*   There is no evidence of public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
