Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-12603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how OpenCV reads and processes image data, specifically within the BMP decoder.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by malformed image files processed by `cv::imread`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:**  Occurs in `FillColorRow4` function while processing a BMP image, leading to a write outside of allocated memory.
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  Occurs in `cv::RLByteStream::getBytes` function when reading a BMP header, leading to a write past the allocated heap buffer.
*  **Integer Overflow:**  The Debian security advisory also mentions integer overflows as a potential cause for issues while reading data, however it is not confirmed in the specific context of CVE-2017-12603.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write and heap overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Memory corruption:** The described vulnerabilities involve writing to memory locations that the program is not authorized to write to. This could lead to unexpected program behavior or potentially allow further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious image files:** An attacker can craft a specially crafted BMP image file.
*   **`cv::imread` function:** The crafted image file is then loaded using OpenCV's `cv::imread` function, which triggers the vulnerabilities within the BMP decoding process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide the malformed image file to the vulnerable application (e.g. by having the application open a crafted image file from disk).

**Additional details:**

*   The github issue #9309 provides a detailed description of the vulnerability and valgrind output, which provides more specific technical details compared to the CVE description.
*   The `utils.cpp`, `grfmt_bmp.cpp`, and `bitstrm.cpp` files are identified as vulnerable code paths.
*   The vulnerability was present in OpenCV versions prior to 2.4.13-r3.
*   The Debian security advisories confirm that this CVE is addressed in their security updates for Debian 8 and 9, specifically in version 2.4.9.1+dfsg-1+deb8u2 and 2.4.9.1+dfsg1-2+deb9u1
