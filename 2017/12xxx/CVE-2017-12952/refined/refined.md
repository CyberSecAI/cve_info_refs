Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2017-12952:

**CVE-2017-12952**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference in the `LoadString` function within `helper.h` of libgig.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `LoadString` function does not properly handle cases where the input string pointer `str` is invalid (possibly NULL or pointing to an invalid memory region). The code accesses `str[len]` without checking if `str` is valid, leading to a dereference of an invalid pointer.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit leads to a denial of service due to a segmentation fault and application crash.
*   **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted gig file processed by libgig. The file triggers the vulnerable code path during string loading, specifically in the `DLS::Info::LoadString` function which calls the vulnerable `LoadString` function in `helper.h`.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to provide a crafted GIG file to the vulnerable application.
