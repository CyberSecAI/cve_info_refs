Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A memory leak occurs within the `ReadImage` function in ImageMagick.

**Vulnerability:**
- The `ReadImage` function, specifically in `MagickCore/constitute.c`, does not properly free allocated memory, leading to a memory leak. The leak occurs through multiple function calls including `AcquireImageInfo` and `AcquirePixelCache`, which allocate memory that is not released.

**Impact:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted file that triggers the memory leak. Repeated processing of such files can exhaust available memory, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by processing a crafted file, as demonstrated in the provided test case.
- The `ReadImage` function is invoked as part of the image loading process, which means that any tool or application that uses ImageMagick to process image files can be a potential target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted file to ImageMagick.
- This could be through a web interface that processes uploaded files, an email attachment that triggers image processing, or any other scenario where ImageMagick processes files.
- No special privileges are required; the vulnerability can be triggered through standard image processing functionality.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided crash report shows the call stack that leads to the memory leak and shows that it originates in `__interceptor_malloc`.
- The content indicates the direct and indirect leaks, and the total amount of leaked memory.
- The specific version `ImageMagick 7.0.6-3 Q16 x86_64` is affected.
- The testcase provided indicates the file format to trigger the vulnerability is MAT.
- The issue was identified by ADLab of Venustech.
