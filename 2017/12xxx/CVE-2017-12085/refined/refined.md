- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Circle with Disney cloud infrastructure uses only the MAC address from the authentication token to route API requests to the corresponding device. The rest of the token is not validated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reliance on untrusted input (MAC address) for routing decisions. Lack of proper validation of the entire token used for authentication, leading to the possibility of spoofing requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can send specially crafted packets to the Circle cloud, which would then be routed to any arbitrary Circle device, allowing the attacker to communicate with the device. This could lead to unauthorized access and control over the device and potentially the network it's connected to.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by sending a crafted API request to `remote.meetcircle.co:45671` with a valid MAC address of a target Circle device, but with other parts of the token spoofed. The attacker needs network connectivity to the internet to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to know or obtain the MAC address of the targeted Circle device and have the ability to send network requests to `remote.meetcircle.co:45671` over the internet. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the targeted device.
