## Description

[![@kevinoclam](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13563369?u=df8cd85bc7df62e0ea64b1d9dd0c1d9e05950fd5&v=4&size=48)](/kevinoclam)[kevinoclam](https://github.com/kevinoclam)opened [on Aug 15, 2017](https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/issues/907#issue-250207284)

it's not a high level vuln, maybe medium or low

line 37

echo \_\_("FATAL: Spike Kill method '%s' is Invalid\n", get\_nfilter\_request\_var('method'));

should change into

echo \_\_("FATAL: Spike Kill method '%s' is Invalid\n", htmlspecialchars(get\_nfilter\_request\_var('method')));

[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13563369/29300067-a8230c86-81a5-11e7-8765-fadf7b25889b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13563369/29300067-a8230c86-81a5-11e7-8765-fadf7b25889b.png)

I should found this at issue 877, I'm sorry for the delay
