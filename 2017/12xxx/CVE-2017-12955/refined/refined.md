The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12955.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the `basicio.cpp` file of the exiv2 library. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `Exiv2::MemIo::read` function, which is called by `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The `std::memcpy` operation in `Exiv2::MemIo::read` copies more data than the allocated buffer size. This happens because the `rcount` parameter is not properly validated against the available data size. The `allow` variable is meant to limit the copy, but its calculation is insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to out-of-bounds writes, causing memory corruption and potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash observed in the provided information, triggered by crafted input, serves as a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file (POC11).
- **Exiv2 CLI tool:** Using the exiv2 command-line tool to process the malicious image file triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted image file to a system using the vulnerable exiv2 library. No special privileges are needed to trigger the bug, user-level access is sufficient.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the `printIFDStructure` call, specifically within the `memcpy` operation at line `1281` of `basicio.cpp`.
- The crash is a consequence of writing past the allocated buffer in heap memory.
- A specific "POC11" file is attached to the bug report, indicating a proof-of-concept exploit is available.
- The issue was fixed in the upstream project and backported.
- The fix is included in `exiv2-0.27.0-1.el7_6` package for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
