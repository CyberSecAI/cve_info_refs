```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The api/storage web interface in Unitrends Backup (UB) before 10.0.0 does not validate input parameters.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Authentication bypass via SQL injection.
- Command injection due to lack of input validation.

Impact of exploitation:
A remote attacker can bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the target system.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/storage` endpoint.
- The request includes a malicious `hostname` parameter within a JSON payload, which contains the command to be executed.
- The request includes a base64-encoded SQL injection string in the AuthToken header to bypass authentication.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Unitrends Backup server.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.
