Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the dynamic access control list (ACL) feature within Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco Catalyst 4000 Series Switches. This flaw can lead to a failure in dynamic ACL assignment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the failure of the dynamic ACL assignment mechanism. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to improper authentication, classified as CWE-287.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can result in the affected port failing open. This means that the port bypasses the intended dynamic ACL and allows traffic to pass to the default VLAN, potentially exposing the network to unauthorized access or attacks. An attacker can gain the ability to send traffic that should have been blocked by the dynamic ACL.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent network access. This implies that an attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable device to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker. This means they don't need any prior authentication on the switch, but they must be on the same physical or logical network segment as the affected switch.

**Summary:**
CVE-2017-12213 describes a vulnerability in Cisco Catalyst 4000 series switches, where a failure in dynamic ACL assignment can lead to a port failing open, effectively bypassing security controls and allowing unauthorized network traffic. An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this.
