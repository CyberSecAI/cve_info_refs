Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2017-12340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Cisco NX-OS System Software handles access to the Bash shell.  Specifically, an authenticated, local attacker can bypass the disabled Bash shell restrictions on the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Access Control: The system fails to properly restrict access to the Bash shell based on configured settings.
- Bash shell access is granted even when the shell is disabled in the system configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to the underlying operating system's Bash shell.
- This would provide the attacker with an avenue to execute arbitrary commands and potentially compromise the system, leading to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required, meaning the attacker needs to have existing access to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with a high privilege account on the affected Cisco devices.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the device, meaning access directly to the system rather than network access.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco MDS Multilayer Director Switches, Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, and Cisco Nexus 7700 Series Switches running vulnerable versions of Cisco NX-OS System Software.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- There are no known workarounds; a software update is required to fix the issue.
- The CVSS score is 4.2, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L, indicating a vulnerability with low impact that requires local access with high privileges.
