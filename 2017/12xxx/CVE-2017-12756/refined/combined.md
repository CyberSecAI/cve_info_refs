eXtplorer version 2.1.10 has been released!

These are the changes:
- fixed vulnerability discovered by ADLab of Venustech (command injection, but requires admin access)
- webdav display UPPER/CASE/FULL/PATH with some webdav client
- standalone extplorer webdav does not work with PHP7
- CVE-2016-4313: archive path traversal vulnerability in extplorer 2.1.9
- [#202](/issues/202 "Fehler: Archive Extract (Gelöst)") Users with read only permissions should not be able to extract archives.
- added indonesian language files

An update is highly recommended.
