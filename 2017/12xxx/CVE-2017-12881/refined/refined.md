- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Spring Batch Admin application, before version 1.3.0, is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CSRF: The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can hijack the authentication of an unspecified victim and submit arbitrary requests, potentially exploiting other vulnerabilities such as the file upload vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A remote attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can perform actions on the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into executing a crafted request.
