# X.Org Server: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201711-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in X.Org Server, the worst
of which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-base/xorg-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.19.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.19.5** |

### Background

The X.Org project provides an open source implementation of the X Window
System.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in X.Org Server. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

Attackers could execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is now know workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All X.Org Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X.Org X server. An
attacker who's able to connect to an X server could cause a denial of
service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:1.16.4-1+deb8u2.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.19.2-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.
