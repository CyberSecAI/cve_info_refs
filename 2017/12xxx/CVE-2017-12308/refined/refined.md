Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-12308

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of parameters passed to the web server of affected Cisco Small Business Managed Switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The core vulnerability is an HTTP response splitting issue. This occurs when an attacker can inject malicious data into an HTTP response header, leading to unintended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected web interface.
*   **Access to Sensitive Browser-Based Information:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored within the user's browser, such as cookies or session data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Links:** An attacker could convince a user to click on a specially crafted malicious link.
*   **Request Interception:** An attacker could intercept a user's legitimate request and inject malicious code before it reaches the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They can target the web interface of the switches remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires some user interaction, as the user needs to either click a malicious link or have their request intercepted.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco 350 Series Managed Switches
*   Cisco 350X Series Stackable Managed Switches
*  Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches
*   Cisco ESW2 Series Advanced Switches
*   Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches
*   Cisco Small Business 500 Series Stackable Managed Switches

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1 (MEDIUM).
*   CWE-113 maps to Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting').
