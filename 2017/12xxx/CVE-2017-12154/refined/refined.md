## Analysis of CVE-2017-12154

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12154:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the nested KVM (nVMX) implementation within the Linux kernel, specifically in the `prepare_vmcs02` function (`arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c`). The function doesn't properly enforce the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" VM-execution controls in second level (L2) nested hypervisor setups.

*   **Weakness:** When a first-level hypervisor (L1) does *not* enable the "use TPR shadow" VM-execution control in its VMCS12, the L0 hypervisor (the host) should enforce that CR8 register accesses are intercepted through the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" controls, this is not always the case.. If L0 fails to do this, the L2 guest will gain unrestricted read/write access to the host's hardware CR8 register.

*   **Impact:** This vulnerability allows a malicious L2 guest OS user to directly access the hardware CR8 register of the host. This can be leveraged to cause a denial-of-service by crashing the host system.

*  **Attack vector:** Local attack within a virtualized environment. Specifically in nested virtualization setups (L0 host running L1 guest, which in turn runs L2 guest)
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a malicious or compromised L2 guest OS which is inside a L1 hypervisor that does not have the "use TPR shadow" control enabled. The attacker needs the ability to execute code in the L2 guest.

**2. Technical Details:**

*   The fix involves modifying `prepare_vmcs02` function in `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c` to ensure that the "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" VM-execution controls are enabled in vmcs02 when "use TPR shadow" is not enabled in vmcs12.
*   The relevant upstream commit for the fix is [51aa68e7d57e3217192d88ce90fd5b8ef29ec94f](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=51aa68e7d57e3217192d88ce90fd5b8ef29ec94f)
* Red Hat Bugzilla Bug [1491224](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491224) tracks this CVE and has the following description:
    ```
    Linux kernel built with the KVM virtualisation support(CONFIG_KVM), with nested virtualisation(nVMX) feature enabled(nested=1), is vulnerable to a crash due to disabled external interrupts. As L2 guest could access(r/w) hardware CR8 register of the host(L0).
  
    In a nested virtualisation setup, L2 guest user could use this flaw to potentially crash the host(L0) resulting in DoS.
    ```

**3. Affected Systems:**

*   Systems using the Linux kernel with KVM virtualization and nested virtualization enabled.
*   Specifically, the issue affects configurations where the L1 hypervisor (guest) does not enable the "use TPR shadow" VM-execution control.
*   Red Hat: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and possibly other Red Hat products which are fixed by the errata RHSA-2018:0676, RHSA-2018:1062 and RHSA-2019:1946
*   Ubuntu:  Specifically, Ubuntu 12.04 ESM (via the HWE kernel), and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS were affected. These are fixed in USN-3698-1 and USN-3698-2.
*   Debian: Fixed in kernel versions 3.16.43-2+deb8u5 (jessie) and 4.9.30-2+deb9u5 (stretch) according to DSA 3981-1.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of service of the host system as the malicious L2 guest can overwrite the CR8 register.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious or compromised L2 guest OS that can execute code. This code must have a way to interact with the hardware CR8 register, and be inside a L1 hypervisor that does not have the "use TPR shadow" control enabled.

**6. Resolution:**

*   Apply the kernel patch, which enforces proper CR8 handling in nested virtualization setups.
*   Upgrade to the patched version of the Linux kernel.
*   For Red Hat: apply RHSA-2018:0676, RHSA-2018:1062 or RHSA-2019:1946, as appropriate to your distribution.
*  For Ubuntu: upgrade to linux-image-3.13.0-153.203 (or a later version)
* For Debian: upgrade to kernel version 3.16.43-2+deb8u5 (jessie) or 4.9.30-2+deb9u5 (stretch).

**7. Key Takeaways:**

*   This CVE highlights a vulnerability specific to nested virtualization environments in the Linux kernel.
*   The fix is relatively straightforward, involving proper configuration of VM-execution controls.
*   A compromised guest OS can be leveraged to exploit hypervisor vulnerabilities.
*   This vulnerability can be mitigated with a kernel update.

**8. Additional Notes:**

*   The severity rating for this CVE is considered high due to the potential for system crash.
*  The CVSS score of 7.1 is due to the local attack vector, low complexity, and potential for high impact to confidentiality and integrity
*   The vulnerability is specific to Intel x86 processors.
*  The upstream fix is available at [torvalds/linux@51aa68e](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/51aa68e7d57e3217192d88ce90fd5b8ef29ec94f).
