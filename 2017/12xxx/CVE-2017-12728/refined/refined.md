- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Privilege Management. Authenticated, non-administrative local users can alter service executables with escalated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software fails to properly manage user privileges, allowing non-administrative users to modify service executables. This results in a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the system services, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. An attacker needs to be an authenticated, non-administrative local user on the system running the affected software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid, non-administrative user account on the affected system.
