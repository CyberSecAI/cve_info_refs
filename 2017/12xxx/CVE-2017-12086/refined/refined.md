Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `BKE_mesh_calc_normals_tessface` function of Blender when handling mesh data from older .blend files.
- An integer overflow occurs during memory allocation for calculating normals. The multiplication of `totface` and/or `totvert` fields of the `Mesh` structure with a constant factor (12) results in a value that exceeds the maximum 32-bit integer. This causes the `MEM_callocN` function to allocate an undersized buffer.
- Subsequently, during the normal calculation, the application writes beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Integer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the integer overflow during the calculation of the required buffer size.
-   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** The undersized buffer allocation coupled with subsequent out-of-bounds write results in a classic heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Code Execution:** The buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Blender application. The attacker could potentially gain control of the user's system by crafting a malicious blend file.
-   **Application Crash:** The provided crash information shows an access violation due to the out-of-bounds write operation.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious .blend File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted .blend file containing specific `totvert` and `totface` values which lead to the overflow.
-   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious .blend file. This could be through social engineering or other methods of enticing the user to open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to create a malicious .blend file:** The attacker must be able to craft a .blend file that exploits the vulnerability by setting specific values for `totvert` and `totface` that cause an integer overflow.
-   **Ability to convince a user to open the file:** The attacker must be able to persuade a target user to open the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when loading older versions of .blend files (<256 or =256 with subversion <6).
*   The `blo_do_versions_250` function initiates the vulnerable code path for older file versions.
*   The vulnerability lies within the calculation of the vertex normals using the function `normal_float_to_short_v3`.
*   The provided exploit proof-of-concept is a python script (`poc.py.zip`) which allows generating the malicious `.blend` files.

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary mitigation is to avoid opening untrusted .blend files.
*   Updating Blender to a version that contains the patch for this vulnerability is also recommended (versions >= 2.79).
