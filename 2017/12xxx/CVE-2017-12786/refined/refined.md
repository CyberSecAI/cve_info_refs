{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw when applying ACL changes requested from the CLI could expose noviengine and cliengine network services. These services are prone to a stack-based buffer overflow when unpacking serialized values.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain privileged (root) code execution on the switch device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted payload to TCP ports 9090 or 12345.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the vulnerable device on ports 9090 or 12345."
