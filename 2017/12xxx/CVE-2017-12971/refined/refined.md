Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2017-12971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the Apache2Triad application. Specifically, user-supplied input is not properly sanitized when creating user accounts, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This code is then stored in the "slimftpd.conf" configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User input within the `account` parameter during the user creation process is not properly sanitized or encoded. This allows for the storage of arbitrary JavaScript code within the "slimftpd.conf" file.
- Session Fixation: The advisory notes that this session fixation flaw can be leveraged to bypass normal authentication and exploit the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to potentially:
  - Steal cookies and session tokens.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
  - Redirect the user to malicious websites.
  - Potentially gain further access to the system.
- The injected XSS payload persists in the "slimftpd.conf" file meaning that the code can be executed anytime the configuration file is accessed or parsed by the application/user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious webpage or link. The provided example uses a crafted HTML form with a malicious XSS payload in the `account` field.
- Because of the Session Fixation vulnerability, the attacker can leverage the controlled PHPSESSID to bypass normal authentication, making the XSS attack easier to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link or webpage.
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to interact with the malicious link/page.
- No prior authentication to the target application is needed because of the Session Fixation flaw and the nature of the XSS vulnerability itself, as the malicious code gets stored in a configuration file.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable parameter is `account` when creating a new user.
- The malicious payload is embedded within the `account` field, for example: `<input type="hidden" name="account" value='"/><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>'>`
- The payload is written into the `slimftpd.conf` configuration file located in "C:\apache2triad\ftp".
- The execution of the XSS payload happens when the "slimftpd.conf" configuration file is parsed by the browser or application.
