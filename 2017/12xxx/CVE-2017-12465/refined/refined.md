{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflows in the `iottlv_parse_sequence` and `localrpc_parse` functions due to incorrect variable types.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-190"
    ],
    "impact": "Unspecified impact due to the integer overflows. The issue #131 mentions `memcpy()` in `LRPC_FLATNAME` will run amok.",

      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "description": "Multiple integer overflows in CCN-lite before 2.00 allow context-dependent attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving the (1) vallen variable in the iottlv_parse_sequence function or (2) typ, vallen and i variables in the localrpc_parse function."
