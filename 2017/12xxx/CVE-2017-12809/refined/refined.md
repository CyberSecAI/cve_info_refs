Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12809:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference within the QEMU IDE CDROM emulation code when attempting to flush an empty CDROM drive. Specifically, the `blk_aio_flush` function would crash when called on a block device with a NULL `blk_bs` field (block backend).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a member of a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A privileged user within the guest OS can trigger the vulnerability, causing the QEMU process to crash and resulting in a denial of service for the virtual machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- A privileged user inside the guest operating system can trigger the flaw by initiating a flush operation on an empty CDROM device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have privileged access within the guest OS.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a check to see if the block device has a valid block backend (`blk_bs(s->blk)`). If not, it skips the call to `blk_aio_flush()` and performs a no-op by calling the callback directly.
- A temporary workaround was implemented to avoid the crash until a complete fix can be implemented.
