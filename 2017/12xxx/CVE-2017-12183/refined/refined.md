Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing length validation in the XFIXES extension of the X.Org X server. Specifically, the server did not properly validate the lengths of data received in certain XFIXES requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper checks on the length fields within XFIXES requests. This allows a malicious client to potentially send crafted requests with invalid lengths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could send a request with a large, invalid length, leading to a buffer overflow or other memory-related issues, causing the X server to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** It is mentioned that arbitrary code execution is a possibility. Although not explicitly detailed in the provided excerpts, the memory corruption caused by the unvalidated length could potentially be exploited to gain control of the X server's execution flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Connection:** An attacker needs to be able to connect to the X server via the network.
- **Malicious X Client:** The attacker exploits this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted XFIXES request with an invalid length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target X server.
- **X Client Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send X client requests to the server. This likely means they need to be an authorized X client (or able to spoof being one).

**More Details Than CVE Description:**
The provided content provides more technical details than a basic CVE description would, such as:
- Specific affected functions: `ProcXFixesSetCursorName`, `SProcXFixesCreatePointerBarrier`, `ProcXFixesCopyRegion`, `SProcXFixesCopyRegion`, `SProcXFixesChangeSaveSet`, `SProcXFixesQueryVersion`
- The exact code changes to fix the issue, adding `REQUEST_SIZE_MATCH` or `REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE` to enforce length checks.
- The vulnerable areas are in the XFIXES extension
- Fix involved adding length checks using macros such as `REQUEST_SIZE_MATCH` and `REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE`.

**Summary of Patches:**
The patches focus on validating sizes of requests and data. Patches were applied to `xfixes/cursor.c`, `xfixes/region.c`, `xfixes/saveset.c`, and `xfixes/xfixes.c`, by adding checks to ensure the lengths of requests match the expected sizes.

**Affected versions:**
- xorg-server versions prior to 1.19.5 are vulnerable
