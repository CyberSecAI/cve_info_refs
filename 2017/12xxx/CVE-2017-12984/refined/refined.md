Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper output sanitization when displaying user-submitted content in the admin panel. While the application uses `htmlspecialchars` for input sanitization before storing data in the database, the content is displayed unsanitized when viewed/edited in the admin panel. Specifically, the `content` parameter from the message table is directly output in the `message_update.php` file within a `<textarea>` tag.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Because the application does not sanitize the data on output, it is vulnerable to stored XSS.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the message content via the user-facing contact form. When an administrator views or edits the message in the admin panel, the attacker's JavaScript code will be executed in the administrator's browser. This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or further compromise of the administrative user's account.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker submits a message using the user-facing contact form, including malicious JavaScript code within the `content` field. The `content` field will be sanitized using `htmlspecialchars`, which will encode special characters, thus preventing XSS at that point.
    *   The administrator accesses the admin panel and views/edits the message. At this point the application fetches the data from the database and directly inserts the previously stored content within a textarea element, without sanitizing it. As a result, the attacker-supplied JavaScript code is rendered and executed in the administrator's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to submit messages via the user-facing contact form.
    *   The attacker does not need any administrative privileges, but requires an administrator to view the message in the admin panel to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit example provided demonstrates the injection of an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` handler to execute JavaScript. This is a common method used to demonstrate XSS vulnerabilities.
