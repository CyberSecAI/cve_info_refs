# Hashicorp vagrant-vmware-fusion 4.0.24 - Local Privilege Escalation

#### EDB-ID:

###### [2017-12579](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12579)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
# I have previously disclosed a couple of bugs in Hashicorp's vagrant-vmware-fusion plugin for vagrant.

# Unfortunately the 4.0.23 release which was supposed to fix the previous bug I reported didn't address the issue, so Hashicorp quickly put out another release
# - 4.0.24 - after that (but didn't update the public changelog on github).

# Unfortunately 4.0.24 is still vulnerable, largely due to a fundamental design flaw in the way the plugin is written combined with the need to elevate
# privileges for certain functions within Fusion.

# Because Hashicorp need users to be able to update the plugin as the local non-root user the encrypted ruby code that the plugin is comprised of must
# remain owned by the non-root user. This means there is a huge attack surface that we can exploit to manipulate the execution of the program and still get
# root on 4.0.24.

# I wrote this exploit before Fusion 10 was released and on the surface 4.0.24 is not compatible with Fusion 10. Curiously though it can be fairly easily tricked
# into working (at least partially) with Fusion 10 simply by patching out the version check and creating a symlink. I discovered this while trying to get the
# 4.0.24 exploit working with Fusion 10 installed - we can simply monkey-patch the version check out of the code, create a symlink for a binary that VMWare
# moved in v10 and then we're away. I was able to vagrant up and ssh into the running vm without any issues. It also means I was able to update the exploit so
# that it works on Fusion 8.x and Fusion 10.

# This seems to be (finally!) fixed properly in 4.0.25 by replacing the suid helper binary with a new go binary that contains all the required elevated
# operations and doesn't call back to the vulnerable ruby code.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
