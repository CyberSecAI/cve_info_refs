Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the firewall configuration of the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module (APIC-EM). This misconfiguration allows unauthorized access to internal services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is a lack of proper access controls, specifically within the firewall configuration of the APIC-EM device. This allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions and reach internal resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privileged Access:** An attacker can gain privileged access to services that should only be available on the internal network of the APIC-EM.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This suggests a successful exploit could enable an attacker to read sensitive data, modify system configurations, or disrupt service operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment (adjacent) as the vulnerable APIC-EM device. This suggests the attack is from within the local network or VLAN.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the same network as the vulnerable APIC-EM. This could involve being physically on the same network segment or logically within the same VLAN.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module (APIC-EM) prior to version 1.5.
- No workarounds are available.
- The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Georgi Geshev of MWR InfoSecurity.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability in APIC-EM version 1.5 or later.
