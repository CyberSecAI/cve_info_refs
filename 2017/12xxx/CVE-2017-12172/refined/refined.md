{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by privilege escalation flaws in the initialization scripts of PostgreSQL, where the startup log file for the postmaster process was opened while the process was still owned by root.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the database administrator could modify root-owned files by creating symbolic links that point to those files before the PostgreSQL server process starts, leading to the corruption of the specified files with logged data.  Red Hat init scripts have race condition vulnerabilities that may enable the escalation of privileges from the postgres user account to root.  The postgresql packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are susceptible during the initdb and update actions (through the postgresql-setup script). The vulnerability is that the redirection of output to log files is done with root privileges and not the postgres user privileges.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with access to the postgres user account can leverage the privilege escalation flaws to obtain root access on the server machine and modify or overwrite root-owned files.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a database administrator with access to the postgres user account manipulating the startup log file and other related files via symbolic links, leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires access to the postgres user account to be able to exploit these vulnerabilities."
