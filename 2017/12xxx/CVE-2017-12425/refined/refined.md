{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A missing check for integer overflow when handling chunk sizes in HTTP requests. A wrong if statement in the varnishd source code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow vulnerability leading to an assertion failure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause the varnishd worker process to abort and restart, losing the cached contents and effectively leading to a Denial of Service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with a chunk size larger than a signed 64-bit signed integer can hold.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Varnish server."
