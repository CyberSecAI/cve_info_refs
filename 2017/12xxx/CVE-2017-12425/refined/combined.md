# VSV00001 DoS vulnerability[¶](#vsv00001-dos-vulnerability "Permalink to this heading")

[CVE-2017-12425](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-12425)

Date: 2017-08-02

A wrong if statement in the varnishd source code means that
particular invalid requests from the client can trigger an assert.

This causes the varnishd worker process to abort and restart, loosing
the cached contents in the process.

An attacker can therefore crash the varnishd worker process on
demand and effectively keep it from serving content - a Denial-of-Service
attack.

Mitigation is possible from VCL or by updating to a fixed version
of Varnish Cache.

## Versions affected[¶](#versions-affected "Permalink to this heading")

* 4.0.1 to 4.0.4
* 4.1.0 to 4.1.7
* 5.0.0
* 5.1.0 to 5.1.2

## Mitigation from VCL[¶](#mitigation-from-vcl "Permalink to this heading")

Note that there are subtle differences on the VCL workarounds,
depending on which version of Varnish you are running, make sure
to use the right one.

These VCL snippets work by failing all client requests which attempt
to use Transfer-encoding: chunked.

Normally browsers will not issue such requests, but we know there
are cases where B2B applications, APIs and special webservices
will use client requests with chunked encoding.

You can use this command to see if you have client traffic with
chunked encoding:

```
varnishlog -cq ReqHeader:Transfer-Encoding -i ReqMethod -i ReqURL

```

If you need some requests with chunked encoding to work, you will
have to write VCL code to white-list these clients based on IP/
authentication/cookies or other criteria, and then only call the
exploit\_workaround\_xxx function for the malicios clients.

### Varnish 4.0.x (and Varnish Cache Plus 4.0.x)[¶](#varnish-4-0-x-and-varnish-cache-plus-4-0-x "Permalink to this heading")

Set the vcc\_allow\_inline parameter to true, either by passing:

```
-pvcc_allow_inline_c=true

```

on the command line or by issuing the CLI command:

```
param.set vcc_allow_inline_c true

```

Then add this to the front of your VCL:

```
sub exploit_workaround_4_0 {
        # This needs to come before your vcl_recv function
        # The following code is only valid for Varnish Cache and
        # Varnish Cache Plus versions 4.0.x
        if (req.http.transfer-encoding ~ "(?i)chunked") {
                C{
                struct dummy_req {
                        unsigned magic;
                        int restarts;
                        int esi_level;
                        int disable_esi;
                        char hash_ignore_busy;
                        char hash_always_miss;
                        void *sp;
                        void *wrk;
                        int req_step;
                        struct {
                                void *a;
                                void *b;
                        };
                        int req_body_status;
                };
                ((struct dummy_req *)ctx->req)->req_body_status = 6;
                }C

                return (synth(503, "Bad request"));
        }
}

sub vcl_recv {
        # Call this early in your vcl_recv function
        call exploit_workaround_4_0;
}

```

### Varnish 4.1.x and 5.0 (and Varnish Cache Plus 4.1.x)[¶](#varnish-4-1-x-and-5-0-and-varnish-cache-plus-4-1-x "Permalink to this heading")

Set the vcc\_allow\_inline parameter to true, either by passing:

```
-pvcc_allow_inline_c=true

```

on the command line or by issuing the CLI command:

```
param.set vcc_allow_inline_c true

```

Then add this to the front of your VCL:

```
sub exploit_workaround_4_1 {
        # This needs to come before your vcl_recv function
        # The following code is only valid for Varnish Cache and
        # Varnish Cache Plus versions 4.1.x and 5.0.0
        if (req.http.transfer-encoding ~ "(?i)chunked") {
                C{
                struct dummy_req {
                        unsigned magic;
                        int step;
                        int req_body_status;
                };
                ((struct dummy_req *)ctx->req)->req_body_status = 5;
                }C

                return (synth(503, "Bad request"));
        }
}

sub vcl_recv {
        # Call this early in your vcl_recv function
        call exploit_workaround_4_1;
}

```

### Varnish 5.1.x[¶](#varnish-5-1-x "Permalink to this heading")

Add this to the front of your VCL:

```
sub vcl_recv {
        if (req.http.transfer-encoding ~ "(?i)chunked") {
                return (fail);
        }
}

```

### Source code fix[¶](#source-code-fix "Permalink to this heading")

The source code fix is this one-liner:

```
                if (q == NULL || *q != '\0')
                        ERR("chunked header number syntax");
                cl = (ssize_t)cll;
-               if((uintmax_t)cl != cll)
+               if (cl < 0 || (uintmax_t)cl != cll)
                        ERR("bogusly large chunk size");

                *priv = cl;

```

On varnish 4.0.x this change goes into bin/varnishd/cache/cache\_http1\_proto.c
on anything later it goes into bin/varnishd/http1/cache\_http1\_vfp.c.

### Thankyous and credits[¶](#thankyous-and-credits "Permalink to this heading")

This issue was first noticed by StackPath.com, who contacted their vendor,
Varnish Software, who in turn notified the Varnish Cache project.

Varnish Software staff did most of the heavy lifting, and Martin in particular
gets a hat-tip for trawling the source-code for any similar issues.

And yes, I apologize for writing that buggy line of code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1051917#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2017-08-02 15:08:07 UTC  ``` <https://www.varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00001.html#vsv00001>  A wrong if statement in the varnishd source code means that particular invalid requests from the client can trigger an assert.  This causes the varnishd worker process to abort and restart, loosing the cached contents in the process.  An attacker can therefore crash the varnishd worker process on demand and effectively keep it from serving content - a Denial-of-Service attack.  Changelog roulette, please reassign to the security team if you don't want to take it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1477222#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-01 13:50:47 UTC  ``` Missing check for integer overflow was found in the code handling chunk sizes in HTTP requests. The vulnerability opens up for denial of service (DOS) attacks by a specially crafted HTTP request, which will cause the Varnish daemon to assert and restart, clearing the cache in the process. There is no risk for information leakage or remote execution. The vulnerability is present in all releases of Varnish Cache since version 4.0.1.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1477222#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-01 13:50:51 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Varnish Cache project   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1477222#c2)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-01 14:41:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1307655](attachment.cgi?id=1307655&action=diff "varnish 4.0 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1307655&action=edit "varnish 4.0 patch") varnish 4.0 patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1477222#c3)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-01 14:42:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1307656](attachment.cgi?id=1307656&action=diff "varnish 4.1 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1307656&action=edit "varnish 4.1 patch") varnish 4.1 patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1477222#c4)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-01 14:42:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1307657](attachment.cgi?id=1307657&action=diff "varnish 5.0 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1307657&action=edit "varnish 5.0 patch") varnish 5.0 patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1477222#c5)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-01 14:43:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1307658](attachment.cgi?id=1307658&action=diff "varnish 5.1 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1307658&action=edit "varnish 5.1 patch") varnish 5.1 patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1477222#c9)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-02 16:12:01 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00001.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1477222#c10)  Adam Mariš    2017-08-02 16:12:27 UTC  ``` Created varnish tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1477699](show_bug.cgi?id=1477699 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-12425 varnish: Missing check for integer overflow when handling chunk sizes in HTTP requests [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1477698](show_bug.cgi?id=1477698 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-12425 varnish: Missing check for integer overflow when handling chunk sizes in HTTP requests [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

## Description

[![@mbgrydeland](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/661482?v=4&size=48)](/mbgrydeland)[mbgrydeland](https://github.com/mbgrydeland)opened [on Jul 31, 2017](https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues/2379#issue-246676494)

A client sending a request body using chunked encoding may cause the

Varnish daemon to assert and restart if sending a chunk size larger

than a signed 64-bit signed integer can hold.

This has been assigned VSV00001.

Package        : varnish
CVE ID         : not yet assigned
Debian Bug     : 870467

A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in Varnish, a state of
the art, high-performance web accelerator. Specially crafted HTTP
requests can cause the Varnish daemon to assert and restart, clearing
the cache in the process.

See <https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00001.html> for details.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.0.2-1+deb8u1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.0-7+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.
