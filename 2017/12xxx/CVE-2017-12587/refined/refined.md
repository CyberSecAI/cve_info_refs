Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-12587:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a large loop within the `ReadPWPImage` function in ImageMagick. The size of this loop is determined by a value read from the input file, which is not properly validated and can be arbitrarily large. Additionally, `ReadBlobByte` within the loop does not have success status checking, leading to potentially large number of I/O failures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Loop Size:** The `filesize` variable, controlling the loop's iterations, is derived from the input and can be manipulated to an extremely large value, leading to a resource exhaustion.
*   **Missing I/O Error Handling:** The `ReadBlobByte` function within the loop does not check for errors. If the crafted file is designed to cause read errors, this will cause a large number of failed I/O operations.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The size is directly taken from the input without any sanitization, leading to the uncontrolled loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The oversized loop can cause excessive resource consumption, potentially leading to a denial of service.
*   **CPU exhaustion**: The uncontrolled loop can exhaust the CPU resources, as well as the I/O resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Image Files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted PWP image files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a crafted image:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PWP image file to the ImageMagick application. This could be through a web application, email attachment, or any other means where ImageMagick is used to process user-supplied images.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided GitHub issue ([#535](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/535)) gives a detailed code snippet showcasing the vulnerable loop and how the `filesize` variable is calculated, which leads to the vulnerability.
* The Debian Security Advisories (DSA 4019-1 and DLA 1785-1) confirm that this CVE is a result of missing input sanitization and memory handling issues in ImageMagick that can lead to denial of service.
