```
Root cause of vulnerability: A memory leak exists in libsass.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory leak in libsass, triggered by a specific input crafted to cause deep nesting in the code.

Impact of exploitation: Memory exhaustion or other undefined behavior due to memory leaks. The provided debug information indicates multiple direct and indirect memory leaks, varying in size.

Attack vectors: Input file crafted with deeply nested code structures fed into the `sassc` compiler, based on the provided PoC "Triggered by "./exiv2 $POC7"".

Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to provide a specially crafted input file to the libsass library or sassc tool.
