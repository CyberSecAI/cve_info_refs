Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-12605:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from flaws in how OpenCV handles image file formats, specifically within the `cv::imread` function when parsing a malformed image file.
*   The identified issues include heap overflows and out-of-bounds write errors. These occur while processing image data, particularly during operations within the BMP decoder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:**  The `FillColorRow4` function in `utils.cpp`, called by the `BmpDecoder`, attempts to write data outside the allocated memory region.
*   **Heap overflow:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs during `memcpy` operations within the `RLByteStream::getBytes` function, triggered by a malformed BMP header. This is called by the `BmpDecoder::readHeader` function.
*   **Invalid memory access**: The `fseek` function, called during stream reading, leads to a segmentation fault when trying to seek to invalid memory addresses

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crashes and segmentation faults resulting from the out-of-bounds write and heap overflow can cause the application using OpenCV to terminate. This leads to a DoS condition.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption, which could have other, potentially more severe, security consequences depending on the specific application using OpenCV. This could allow an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** An attacker can craft a specially crafted, malformed image file (e.g., a BMP file) and use it as input to an application using OpenCV's `cv::imread` function.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The Gentoo advisory indicates the vulnerability is "exploitable: remote," implying that an attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability remotely, likely by providing a malicious image through a network service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious image file as input to an application using the vulnerable versions of OpenCV.
*   For remote exploitation, the attacker needs a way to get a program to open the malicious image, for example by getting a user to upload the image to a web application.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue affects multiple versions of OpenCV, including 2.x and 3.3.
*   The issue is related to how image decoders (specifically BMP) handles corrupted files.
*   The provided github issue and debian advisories, provide test cases which can trigger the vulnerability.
