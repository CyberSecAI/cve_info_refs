The provided content relates to CVE-2017-12668.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the `WritePCXImage` function within `coders/pcx.c` in ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unreleased memory allocated for `pcx_colormap` when the image is not of type `DirectClass` and does not have more than 256 colors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak can be triggered by converting an image to the PCX format. Repeated exploitation of this leak can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can cause the memory leak by providing a specially crafted image file to be converted to the PCX format by ImageMagick.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply an image file to ImageMagick for processing. This could be a local file or a file via a network service.
