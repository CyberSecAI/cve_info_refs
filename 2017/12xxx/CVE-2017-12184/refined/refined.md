Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2017-12184:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing length validation within the XINERAMA extension of the X.Org X server. Specifically, the server does not properly validate the size of data received from the client related to screen sizes, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads/writes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unvalidated Lengths:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of lengths provided by the client when using the XINERAMA extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who can connect to an X server can potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) or achieve arbitrary code execution by providing specially crafted requests with invalid lengths.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a client connecting to an X server and sending malicious XINERAMA requests with manipulated length fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the targeted X server. This could be a local connection or a network connection, depending on the server's configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability includes adding size checks in the `ProcPanoramiXGetScreenSize` function in `Xext/panoramiX.c`
*   This CVE is related to other CVEs addressed in the same patch, including CVE-2017-12185, CVE-2017-12186 and CVE-2017-12187, all stemming from the same root cause of unvalidated lengths.
*   The fix also adds an overflow check in `Xext/xres.c` to address another similar vulnerability.
