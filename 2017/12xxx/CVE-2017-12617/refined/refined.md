      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Apache Tomcat's handling of HTTP PUT requests when the `readonly` initialization parameter of the Default servlet is set to `false`, or when the WebDAV servlet is enabled with the `readonly` parameter set to `false`. This allows uploading a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request and then executing arbitrary code contained within the uploaded JSP file.",
