- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled resource consumption in `SYNO.Core.PortForwarding.Rules`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the `SYNO.Core.PortForwarding.Rules` component of Synology DSM, where a lack of proper resource management allows for memory exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack leads to memory exhaustion, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the vulnerable Synology DSM.
