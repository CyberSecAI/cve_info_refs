{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web application does not verify the origin of requests, and the device uses hardcoded credentials and cryptographic keys.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352): The application does not verify if a request was intentionally made by the user, which allows an attacker to trick a user into making malicious requests.",
      "Use of Hard-Coded Credentials (CWE-798): The device uses hard-coded credentials, which could allow unauthorized local low privileged access.",
      "Use of Hard-Coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321): The device utilizes hard-coded private cryptographic keys that may allow an attacker to decrypt traffic from any source."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to obtain hard-coded cryptographic keys, hard-coded credentials, or trick a user into submitting a malicious request, resulting in the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the device and running arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "csrf": "An attacker could trick a user into making a malicious request to the server via CSRF.",
       "hardcoded_credentials": "An attacker with local access to the device can exploit hard-coded credentials to gain unauthorized access to the device.",

      "csrf": "An attacker needs to trick a user into making a malicious request, which can be achieved remotely.",
