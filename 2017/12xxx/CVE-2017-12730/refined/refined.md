Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of **unquoted search path elements** by application services within mySCADA myPRO. This means that when the application looks for executable files or libraries, it does so without enclosing the paths in quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unquoted Search Path (CWE-428):** The core vulnerability is that the application uses unquoted search paths. This allows an attacker to insert malicious executables into directories that are searched by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a local, authenticated but non-privileged user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some form of access to the affected system, such as a user account.
*   **Path Manipulation:** The attacker would place a malicious executable in a directory that is part of the application's search path. The application would then execute that malicious executable with the elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have an account on the system with access to place files in a directory that would be searched by the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker would need a basic understanding of how the system search paths and executables function.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory notes that the skill level needed to exploit this vulnerability is low and public exploits are available.
