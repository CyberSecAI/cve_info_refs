{
  "CVE-2017-12153": {
    "root_cause": "The `nl80211_set_rekey_data()` function in the Linux kernel does not check whether the required netlink attributes (`NL80211_REKEY_DATA_REPLAY_CTR`, `NL80211_REKEY_DATA_KEK`, `NL80211_REKEY_DATA_KCK`) are present in a netlink request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation on netlink attributes"
    ],
    "impact": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the function attempts to access the missing attributes, leading to a system crash (denial of service).",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability can send a crafted `NL80211_CMD_SET_REKEY_OFFLOAD` netlink request to a WiFi interface connected to a wireless network.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges. Additionally, the attacker needs to target a WiFi interface connected to a network, which may require the attacker to be running in the root network namespace or have the ability to move a WiFi interface into their user+net namespace."
