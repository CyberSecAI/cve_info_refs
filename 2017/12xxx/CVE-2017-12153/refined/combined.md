# CVE-2017-12153 Linux kernel: nl80211: null pointer dereference in nl80211\_set\_rekey\_data()

```
Heololo,

A security flaw was discovered in nl80211_set_rekey_data() function in the Linux
kernel since v3.1-rc1 through v4.13. This function does not check whether
the required attributes are present in a netlink request. This request can be
issued by a user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege and may result in NULL dereference
and a system crash.

References:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491046>

<https://marc.info/?t=150525503100001&r=1&w=2>

Suggested upstream patch:

<https://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&m=150525493517953&w=2>

Vulnerability surface:

Further analysis showed that NL80211_CMD_SET_REKEY_OFFLOAD request should be
issued for a WiFi interface connected to a wireless network. This mean that an
attacker should be root already or should be root in a user+net namespace to
which a WiFi interface was moved from a main net namespace. We believe the
later configuration to be very unlikely.

nl80211: check for the required netlink attributes presencenl80211\_set\_rekey\_data() does not check if the required attributes
NL80211\_REKEY\_DATA\_{REPLAY\_CTR,KEK,KCK} are present when processing
NL80211\_CMD\_SET\_REKEY\_OFFLOAD request. This request can be issued by
users with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privilege and may result in NULL dereference
and a system crash. Add a check for the required attributes presence.
This patch is based on the patch by bo Zhang.
This fixes CVE-2017-12153.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1491046#c0)  Vladis Dronov    2017-09-12 21:52:41 UTC  ``` A security flaw is present in nl80211_set_rekey_data() function in the Linux kernel since v3.1-rc1 through v4.13. This function does not check whether required attributes are present in a netlink request. This request can be issued by a user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege and may result in NULL dereference and a system crash.  Vulnerability surface:  An analysis shows that NL80211_CMD_SET_REKEY_OFFLOAD request should be issued for a WiFi interface connected to a wireless network. This means that an attacker should be a privileged user already or should be root in a user+net namespace to which a WiFi interface was moved from a main net namespace. We believe the later configuration to be unlikely.

This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and MRG-2. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,

      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,

        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Debian Bug     : 866511 875881

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-7518

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that KVM is prone to an incorrect debug
    exception (#DB) error occurring while emulating a syscall
    instruction. A process inside a guest can take advantage of this
    flaw for privilege escalation inside a guest.

CVE-2017-7558 (stretch only)

    Stefano Brivio of Red Hat discovered that the SCTP subsystem is
    prone to a data leak vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read
    flaw, allowing to leak up to 100 uninitialized bytes to userspace.

CVE-2017-10661 (jessie only)

    Dmitry Vyukov of Google reported that the timerfd facility does
    not properly handle certain concurrent operations on a single file
    descriptor.  This allows a local attacker to cause a denial of
    service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-11600

    Bo Zhang reported that the xfrm subsystem does not properly
    validate one of the parameters to a netlink message. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this to cause a denial
    of service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-12134 / #866511 / XSA-229

    Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon discovered that when Linux is running
    in a Xen PV domain on an x86 system, it may incorrectly merge
    block I/O requests.  A buggy or malicious guest may trigger this
    bug in dom0 or a PV driver domain, causing a denial of service or
    potentially execution of arbitrary code.

    This issue can be mitigated by disabling merges on the underlying
    back-end block devices, e.g.:
        echo 2 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges

CVE-2017-12146 (stretch only)

    Adrian Salido of Google reported a race condition in access to the
    "driver_override" attribute for platform devices in sysfs. If
    unprivileged users are permitted to access this attribute, this
    might allow them to gain privileges.

CVE-2017-12153

    bo Zhang reported that the cfg80211 (wifi) subsystem does not
    properly validate the parameters to a netlink message. Local users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace with a
    wifi device) can use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-12154

    Jim Mattson of Google reported that the KVM implementation for
    Intel x86 processors did not correctly handle certain nested
    hypervisor configurations. A malicious guest (or nested guest in a
    suitable L1 hypervisor) could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-14106

    Andrey Konovalov discovered that a user-triggerable division by
    zero in the tcp_disconnect() function could result in local denial
    of service.

CVE-2017-14140

    Otto Ebeling reported that the move_pages() system call performed
    insufficient validation of the UIDs of the calling and target
    processes, resulting in a partial ASLR bypass. This made it easier
    for local users to exploit vulnerabilities in programs installed
    with the set-UID permission bit set.

CVE-2017-14156

    "sohu0106" reported an information leak in the atyfb video driver.
    A local user with access to a framebuffer device handled by this
    driver could use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2017-14340

    Richard Wareing discovered that the XFS implementation allows the
    creation of files with the "realtime" flag on a filesystem with no
    realtime device, which can result in a crash (oops). A local user
    with access to an XFS filesystem that does not have a realtime
    device can use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-14489

    ChunYu Wang of Red Hat discovered that the iSCSI subsystem does not
    properly validate the length of a netlink message, leading to
    memory corruption. A local user with permission to manage iSCSI
    devices can use this for denial of service or possibly to execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-14497 (stretch only)

    Benjamin Poirier of SUSE reported that vnet headers are not
    properly handled within the tpacket_rcv() function in the raw
    packet (af_packet) feature. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW
    capability can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service (buffer overflow, and disk and memory corruption) or have
    other impact.

CVE-2017-1000111

    Andrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition in the raw
    packet (af_packet) feature. Local users with the CAP_NET_RAW
    capability can use this for denial of service or possibly to
    execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000112

    Andrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition flaw in the
    UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) code. A local user can use this
    flaw for denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2017-1000251 / #875881

    Armis Labs discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem does not
    properly validate L2CAP configuration responses, leading to a
    stack buffer overflow. This is one of several vulnerabilities
    dubbed "Blueborne". A nearby attacker can use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code on a
    system with Bluetooth enabled.

CVE-2017-1000252 (stretch only)

    Jan H. Schoenherr of Amazon reported that the KVM implementation
    for Intel x86 processors did not correctly validate interrupt
    injection requests. A local user with permission to use KVM could
    use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-1000370

    The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument or
    environment list can result in ASLR bypass for 32-bit PIE binaries.

CVE-2017-1000371

    The Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument
    orenvironment list can result in a stack/heap clash for 32-bit
    PIE binaries.

CVE-2017-1000380

    Alexander Potapenko of Google reported a race condition in the ALSA
    (sound) timer driver, leading to an information leak. A local user
    with permission to access sound devices could use this to obtain
    sensitive information.

Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they
are enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl) then
CVE-2017-11600, CVE-2017-14497 and CVE-2017-1000111 can be exploited
by any local user.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u5.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
