- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the `SYNO.DNSServer.Zone.MasterZoneConf` component of Synology DNS Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to access and write to locations outside of the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote authenticated attackers can write arbitrary files to the system. This could lead to various malicious activities including privilege escalation, denial-of-service, or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `domain_name` parameter. The attacker must be able to make requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user. This implies that they require valid login credentials to the Synology DNS Server.
