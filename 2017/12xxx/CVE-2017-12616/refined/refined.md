Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-12616:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Improper handling of requests when using `VirtualDirContext` in Apache Tomcat. This allowed security constraints to be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Security Constraint Bypass:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass configured security constraints.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially view the source code of JSPs (Java Server Pages).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to potentially sensitive information by viewing JSP source code, which might contain credentials, internal logic or other sensitive data.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially bypass access controls and access restricted resources due to the security constraint bypass.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted HTTP Request:** The vulnerability was triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the server. The specific details of this request aren't outlined here, but it is designed to exploit the flawed logic within `VirtualDirContext`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **No Authentication Required:**  No prior authentication was explicitly required to exploit this vulnerability based on the description.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Apache Tomcat versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.80.
- The `VirtualDirContext` is noted as not intended for use in production environments.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Apache Tomcat version 7.0.81 and later.
- Red Hat states that only the source code for JSP was disclosed, so they marked it WONTFIX, although they still released a fix in JBoss Web Server, likely to prevent unauthorized access, regardless if source code disclosure is present.
- Ubuntu indicates that the vulnerability only affects Tomcat if HTTP PUTs are enabled.
