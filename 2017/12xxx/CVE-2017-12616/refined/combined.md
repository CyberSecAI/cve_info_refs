# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# USN-3665-1: Tomcat vulnerabilities

30 May 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Tomcat.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [tomcat7](/security/cves?package=tomcat7) - Servlet and JSP engine
* [tomcat8](/security/cves?package=tomcat8) - Servlet and JSP engine

## Details

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled being configured with

HTTP PUTs enabled. A remote attacker could use this issue to upload a JSP

file to the server and execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10. ([CVE-2017-12616](/security/CVE-2017-12616),

[CVE-2017-12617](/security/CVE-2017-12617))

It was discovered that Tomcat contained incorrect documentation regarding

description of the search algorithm used by the CGI Servlet to identify

which script to execute. This issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10.

([CVE-2017-15706](/security/CVE-2017-15706))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled en empty string URL

pattern in security constraint definitions. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to gain access to web application resources,

contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS,

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10. ([CVE-2018-1304](/security/CVE-2018-1304))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled applying certain security

constraints. A remote attacker could possibly access certain resources,

contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS,

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10. ([CVE-2018-1305](/security/CVE-2018-1305))

It was discovered that the Tomcat CORS filter default settings were

insecure and would enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins, contrary

to expectations. ([CVE-2018-8014](/security/CVE-2018-8014))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1494283#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2017-09-21 23:13:11 UTC  ``` When running on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server. This issue affects Apache Tomcat versions up to and including 7.0.81. The fix for [CVE-2017-12615](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-12615) does not prevent this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1494283#c9)  Adam Mariš    2017-10-02 12:53:59 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html> <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1494283#c10)  Adam Mariš    2017-10-02 12:58:18 UTC  ``` Created tomcat tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1497681](show_bug.cgi?id=1497681 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-12617 tomcat: Remote Code Execution bypass for CVE-2017-12615 [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1497682](show_bug.cgi?id=1497682 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-12617 tomcat: Remote Code Execution bypass for CVE-2017-12615 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1494283#c17)  Doran Moppert    2017-10-04 05:18:03 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Ensure that readonly is set to true (the default) for the DefaultServlet, WebDAV servlet or application context.

  + CVSS3 Base Metrics: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected**

* Products
  + Tomcat6 6.0.48-0107 and eariler
  + Tomcat7 7.0.73-0110 and eariler
* Models
  + All Synology models

**Description**

* CVE-2017-12615

  When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server.
* CVE-2017-12616

  When using a VirtualDirContext with Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.80 it was possible to bypass security constraints and/or view the source code of JSPs for resources served by the VirtualDirContext using a specially crafted request.

**Mitigation**

None

**Update Availability**

To fix the security issue, please update Tomcat7 to 7.0.82-0113 or above.

Tomcat6 has reached its end of life. We will no longer maintain this package.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1493220#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-19 16:04:54 UTC  ``` When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server.  Affected versions: 7.0.0 to 7.0.79  External References:  <https://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_7.0.81>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1493220#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-20 07:11:25 UTC  ``` Upstream patches:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1804604> <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1804729>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1493220#c10)  Doran Moppert    2017-10-04 05:17:36 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Ensure that readonly is set to true (the default) for the DefaultServlet, WebDAV servlet or application context.

Package        : tomcat7
Version        : 7.0.56-3+really7.0.88-1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7674 CVE-2017-12616 CVE-2018-1304
                 CVE-2018-1305 CVE-2018-8014
Debian Bug     : 802312 898935

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine.

CVE-2017-7674
    The CORS Filter in Apache Tomcat did not add an HTTP Vary header
    indicating that the response varies depending on Origin. This
    permitted client and server side cache poisoning in some
    circumstances.

CVE-2017-12616
    When using a VirtualDirContext with Apache Tomcat it was possible to
    bypass security constraints and/or view the source code of JSPs for
    resources served by the VirtualDirContext using a specially crafted
    request.

CVE-2018-1304
    The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the
    context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat when used as
    part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint
    to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorized users to
    gain access to web application resources that should have been
    protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty
    string were affected.

CVE-2018-1305
    Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache
    Tomcat were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because
    security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern
    and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the
    order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be
    applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not
    authorized to access them.

CVE-2018-8014
    The defaults settings for the CORS filter provided in Apache Tomcat
    are insecure and enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins. It is
    expected that users of the CORS filter will have configured it
    appropriately for their environment rather than using it in the
    default configuration. Therefore, it is expected that most users
    will not be impacted by this issue.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
7.0.56-3+really7.0.88-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.
