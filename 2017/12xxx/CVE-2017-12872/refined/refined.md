Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12872:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of standard comparison operators to compare secret material (tokens and passwords) against user-supplied input. This comparison is not done in constant time, and the time taken to perform the comparison leaks information about the secret.
*   Specifically, the `SimpleSAML_Session` class (for session tokens) and the `Htpasswd` authentication source in the `authcrypt` module (for passwords) are affected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Timing Side-Channel Attack:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to timing side-channel attacks. By observing the time it takes the application to respond to authentication attempts, an attacker can incrementally guess the secret (token or password) character by character.
*   **Non-constant time comparison:** The use of standard string comparison operators leads to variable processing times depending on the location of the first difference, which leaks information about the secret data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Session Token Leakage:** For the `SimpleSAML_Session` class, an attacker could potentially leak the authentication token used to prevent session fixation attacks. This token is stored in a cookie. However, this requires the attacker to also mount a session fixation attack, making the exploitation more difficult.
*   **Password Leakage:** In the `Htpasswd` authentication source, an attacker can potentially leak user passwords by measuring the timing of authentication attempts.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack is conducted over the network by sending authentication requests and measuring the server's response time.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the authentication mechanisms vulnerable to the timing side channel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application.
*   For session token leakage, the attacker needs a valid session, which implies performing a session fixation attack, making this scenario less straightforward.
*   For password leakage, the attacker can initiate an authentication request.
*   The attacker needs to be able to accurately measure the response time of the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in SimpleSAMLphp versions 1.14.11 and earlier.
*   The fix involves introducing a `secureCompare()` method that either uses `hash_equals()` (if PHP >= 5.6) or performs a manual constant-time comparison.
*   CVE-2017-12868 is related, as it was an initial incorrect fix for CVE-2017-12872.
