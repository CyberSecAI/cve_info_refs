Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2017-12062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `filter` field in the `manage_user_page.php` script was not properly sanitized before being rendered within an HTML input tag. This allowed for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input (`filter` parameter) is included in the HTML output without sufficient sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Manage User page.
- If Content Security Policy (CSP) is disabled or can be bypassed (e.g., using style tags in older IE versions), the injected JavaScript code will be executed within the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is via the network.
- **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the payload within the `filter` parameter, such as:
  ```
  http://localhost/mantisbt/manage_user_page.php?sort=username&dir=desc&save=1&hideinactive=0&showdisabled=0&filter=ALL"><SVG ONLOAD=&#97&#108&#101&#114&#116(1)><IMG SRC="X
  ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript and convince a user to access the URL while logged into MantisBT.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability because the `manage_user_page.php` page is accessible to any logged-in user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 2.1.0 and affected all versions up to 2.5.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.5.2 and 2.6.0 by applying proper sanitization to the `filter` parameter using `string_attribute()` before rendering it in the HTML.
- The vulnerability can also affect Internet Explorer 10/11 if using the 'style' tag, and if Content Security Policy (CSP) is disabled it can also trigger a 'script' tag.
- The reported fix was to change the following line:
   `<input type="hidden" name="filter" value="<?php echo $f_filter ?>" />`
to
   `<input type="hidden" name="filter" value="<?php echo string_attribute( $f_filter) ?>" />`
