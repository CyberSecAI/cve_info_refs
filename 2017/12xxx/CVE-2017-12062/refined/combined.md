| Priority | normal | Severity | major | Reproducibility | always |
| Status | closed | Resolution | fixed |  | |
| Product Version | 2.0.0-beta.1 |  | | | |

|  | | | | | |
|
| Summary | 0023146: CVE-2017-12061: XSS in /admin/install.php script | | | | |
| Description | Some variables like $f\_database, $f\_db\_username and $f\_admin\_username are under user control and don't sanitize well when displayed in error messages.  /admin/install.php: 202: $f\_database\_name = gpc\_get( 'database\_name', config\_get( 'database\_name', 'bugtracker' ) ); 203: $f\_db\_username = gpc\_get( 'db\_username', config\_get( 'db\_username', '' ) ); ... 216: $f\_admin\_username = gpc\_get( 'admin\_username', '' ); ... 437: $g\_db = ADONewConnection( $f\_db\_type ); 438: $t\_result = @$g\_db->Connect( $f\_hostname, $f\_db\_username, $f\_db\_password, $f\_database\_name ); ... 444: print\_test\_result( BAD, false, 'Database user doesn\'t have access to the database ( ' . db\_error\_msg() . ' )' );  Because "admin" folder is accessed by anyone and not moved or denied after successfully Mantis installation many servers have that issue. | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | Browse to URLs:  <http://mantis.server/admin/install.php?install=3&database_name=%3Ch1%3EXSS&admin_username=%3Ch1%3EXSS> or <http://mantis.server//admin/install.php?install=3&database_name=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27XSS%27)%3C/script%3E&admin_username=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27XSS%27)%3C/script%3E> | | | | |

We use CSP headers as an additional way to prevent such kind of XSS. I tried latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari and was not able to reproduce the issue.

| Summary | 0023166: CVE-2017-12062: XSS in manage\_user\_page.php | | | | |
| Description | `filter` field is not sanitized before being rendered in input tag.  ``` $f_filter = utf8_strtoupper( gpc_get_string( 'filter', config_get( 'default_manage_user_prefix' ) ) ); /* ... <strip> ... */ <input type="hidden" name="filter" value="<?php echo $f_filter ?>" /> ```  There're also `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Content-Type`, but we can still inject `style` tag to trigger xss in IE10/11 or user may disable CSP/XCT lead to abusing `script` tag | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | It's a little bit harder because `input` was formated with `strtoupper`. We still can bypass using this payload  ``` http://localhost/mantisbt/manage_user_page.php ?sort=username &dir=desc &save=1 &hideinactive=0 &showdisabled=0 &filter=ALL"><SVG ONLOAD=&#97&#108&#101&#114&#116(1)><IMG SRC="X ``` | | | | |

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

Subject: Advisory: XSS issues in MantisBT (CVE-2017-12061, CVE-2017-12062)

Please take note of the following 2 cross-site scripting issues in MantisBT

Best regards
Damien Regad
MantisBT developer

1. CVE-2017-12061: XSS in /admin/install.php script

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MantisBT
Installation script allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code
through crafted parameters.

This is only possible if the admin/ folder was not deleted after
installation, as recommended in the MantisBT Admin Guide [1].

Affected versions: 1.3.11 and older, 2.5.1 and older
Fixed in versions: 1.3.12, 2.5.2, 2.6.0 (not yet released*)

Patch:
- 1.3:
<https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/17f9b94f031ba93ae2a727bca0e68458ecd08fb0>
- 2.x:

2. CVE-2017-12062: XSS in manage_user_page.php

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MantisBT
Manage User page allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code (if
CSP settings permit it) through a crafted 'filter' parameter.

Affected versions: 2.1.0 through 2.5.1
Fixed in versions: 2.5.2, 2.6.0 (not yet released*)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

That was a copy/paste error. The above should have read:

* Releases 1.3.12, 2.5.2 and 2.6.0 are scheduled for release in the
