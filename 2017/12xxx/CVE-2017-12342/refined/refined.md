Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12342:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Open Agent Container (OAC) feature of Cisco Nexus Series Switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The OAC feature improperly isolates network traffic, allowing an attacker to bypass intended restrictions.
- Specifically, an attacker can read and send packets outside the intended scope of the OAC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive network traffic that should be confined to the OAC.
- **Integrity Impact:** The attacker can send arbitrary packets, which could potentially disrupt or manipulate network communications.
- **Availability Impact:**  While not explicitly stated, the ability to send packets could also lead to a denial of service by overwhelming the device with traffic.
- Overall, the exploitation of this vulnerability allows for a breach of network isolation, allowing attackers to eavesdrop and manipulate network traffic outside of intended boundaries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L)
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires local access to the vulnerable Cisco Nexus switch.
- The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N)
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L), indicating a medium severity.
- The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing.
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability, software updates are the only fix.
- A number of Cisco Nexus series switches are vulnerable
