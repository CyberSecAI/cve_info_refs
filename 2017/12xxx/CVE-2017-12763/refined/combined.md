## Local privileges vulnerability

Luxembourg, August 11th, 2017

NoMachine makes available updated packages to prevent a vulnerability in one of the server utilities which could be exploited by authenticated users to gain access to all local files on Linux and Mac OS X hosts. Furthermore, security fixes for recent flaws discovered in Apache and which affect users of Cloud Server are also included:

CVE-2017-3167 httpd: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() authentication bypass
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3167>

CVE-2017-3169 httpd: mod\_ssl NULL pointer dereference
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3169>

CVE-2017-7679 httpd: mod\_mime buffer overread
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7679>

We strongly recommend all users upgrade their server installations to this release, 5.3.10. Although Enterprise Client is not impacted by these vulnerabilities, we advise users to also update their client installations.

**Supported Platforms**

Windows 32-bit/64-bit XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10

Mac OS X Intel 64-bit 10.5/10.6/10.7/10.8/10.9/10.10/10.11/10.12

Linux 32-bit and 64-bit

Red Hat Enterprise 4/5/6/7
SLED 10.x/11.x
SLES 10/11/12
openSUSE 10.x/11.x/12.x/13.x/42.x
Mandriva 2009/2010/2011
Fedora 10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19/20/21/22/23/24/25
Debian GNU Linux 4.0/5.0/6.0/7.0/8.0
Ubuntu 8.04/8.10/9.04/9.10/10.4/10.10/11.04/11.10/12.04/12.10/13.04/13.10/14.04/14.10/15.04/15.10/16.04/16.10

**Important:** Due to the changes introduced by Apple which has dropped support for 10.5 and 10.6 in recent compilers, NoMachine will discontinue support for those OS X versions in a future release. It will still be possible to request packages specifically built for 10.5 and 10.6 under the provisions of a support contract.
