Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect default configuration of the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) server included within Cisco Meeting Server (CMS). This improper configuration can expose internal interfaces and ports to the external interface of an affected system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Default Configuration:** The TURN server is configured by default in a way that it exposes internal interfaces.
*   **Exposure of Internal Interfaces:** The misconfiguration allows external access to internal services and ports.
*   **Colocation of Services:** The issue is exacerbated when the TURN server runs on the same virtual machine as other CMS services (Call Bridge, Web Bridge, or database nodes).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access to Web Admin Interface:** If the TURN server is colocated with a CMS Call Bridge, an attacker can gain unauthenticated access to the Web Admin interface of CMS.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If colocated with a CMS Web Bridge, the attacker can receive lookup messages for meeting conferences, potentially containing call identifiers and passcodes.
*   **Unauthenticated Database Access:** If colocated with a database node of a CMS database cluster, an attacker can gain unauthenticated access to the database.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to components or sensitive information depending on the deployment model and services in use.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely, targeting the exposed TURN server interface.
*   **Network Based:** Exploitation occurs over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must have valid credentials for and authenticate to the TURN server of the affected system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of this misconfiguration and how to leverage it.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present when the TURN server uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections and is running on the same virtual machine as other colocated CMS services.
* The advisory provides commands to check if TLS is configured for the TURN server.
* Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, and recommends upgrading to the latest versions.
