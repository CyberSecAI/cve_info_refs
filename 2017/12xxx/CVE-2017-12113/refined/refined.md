- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization in the `admin_nodeInfo` API of cpp-ethereum's JSON-RPC server. The API lacks privilege checks, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to access functionality intended for administrators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper authorization: The `admin_nodeInfo` API does not check for user privileges before providing access.
    - Default binding to 0.0.0.0: Exposes the interface to the world by default.
    - Lack of Content-Type enforcement: Allows the API to be triggered via CSRF or SSRF attacks even behind a NAT.
    - Inconsistency with other APIs: Other APIs use `RPC_ADMIN` for privilege checks, which `admin_nodeInfo` lacks.
    - No option to change the default interface to localhost.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive node information (e.g., node ID, IP address, ports, enode) without authentication. This information could be used for further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a JSON request to the `admin_nodeInfo` API of the cpp-ethereum JSON-RPC server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required.
