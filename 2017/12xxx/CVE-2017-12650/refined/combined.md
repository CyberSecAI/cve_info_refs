# SQL Injection and CSRF Security Vulnerability in Loginizer

 2017-08-08 2017-08-08

As part of a vulnerability research project for our [WordPress Security Scanner at WPcans.com](https://wpscans.com), we have been auditing popular WordPress plugins looking for security issues.

While auditing the WordPress plugin [Loginizer](https://sv.wordpress.org/plugins/loginizer/), we discovered a SQL Injection vulnerability and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

This plugin is currently installed on **500,000+** websites.

## About the plugin

According to WordPress.org:

> Loginizer is a WordPress plugin which helps you fight against bruteforce attack by blocking login for the IP after it reaches maximum retries allowed. You can blacklist or whitelist IPs for login using Loginizer. You can use various other features like Two Factor Auth, reCAPTCHA, PasswordLess Login, etc. to improve security of your website.

## Are You at Risk?

This vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization in user provided data and missing checks. As soon as possible upgrade to the latest version of the plugin: **1.3.6**.

You can also use our free security scanner at [WPScans.com](https://wpscans.com) to scan for this vulnerability or the open-source tool wpscan.

## Technical Details CSRF

First, the [CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) vulnerability can be triggered when a admin or a user with *manage\_option* privileges clicks a link provided by an attacker. The link can be hidden with a URL-shortener for example, screenshots from the broken referer/nonce check:

[![Screenshot CSRF](https://blog.wpscans.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/current_user_can-1024x271.png)](https://blog.wpscans.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/current_user_can.png)

As the above screenshot shows the check\_admin\_referer() function is only executed if $\_POST is set. But deleting a whitelist or blacklist IP does not require POST, only GET:

[![Screenshot CSRF](https://blog.wpscans.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/delete_blacklist-1-1024x421.png)](https://blog.wpscans.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/delete_blacklist-1.png)

## Technical Details SQL Injection

When someone tries to login at least one SQL-query is executed by the plugin. The query looks something like this:

```
SELECT * FROM `wp_loginizer_logs` WHERE `ip` = 'myip...
```

The problem above is that an attacker can set IP using different http-headers such as **X-Forwarded-For**depending on the server setup. This http-header is forwarded without any sanitization to **lz\_selectquery()** and then **$wpdb->get\_results()**.

This is a blind SQL injection vulnerability and can be exploited using [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/), as example:

#### Få support och professionella funktioner

Få professionell support från våra experter och Pro-funktioner för att ta din webbplats till nästa nivå med [Loginizer-Security](https://loginizer.com/pricing).

Pro-funktioner:

* MD5 Checksum – of Core WordPress Files. The admin can check and ignore files as well.
* PasswordLess Login – At the time of Login, the username / email address will be asked and an email will be sent to the email address of that account with a temporary link to login.
* Two Factor Auth via Email – On login, an email will be sent to the email address of that account with a temporary 6 digit code to complete the login.
* Two Factor Auth via App – The user can configure the account with a 2FA App like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
* Login Challenge Question – The user can setup a Challenge Question and Answer as an additional security layer. After Login, the user will need to answer the question to complete the login.
* reCAPTCHA – Google’s reCAPTCHA v3/v2, Cloudflare Turnstile, hCAPTCHA can be configured for the Login screen, Comments Section, Registration Form, etc. to prevent automated brute force attacks. Supports WooCommerce as well.
* Byt namn på inloggningssida – Admin kan ändra URL för inloggning (permalänk) till något annat än wp-login.php för att förhindra automatiska brute force attacks.
* Rename WP-Admin URL – The Admin area in WordPress is accessed via wp-admin. With loginizer you can change it to anything e.g. site-admin
* CSRF Protection – This helps in preventing CSRF attacks as it updates the admin URL with a session string which makes it difficult and nearly impossible for the attacker to predict the URL.
* Rename Login with Secrecy – If set, then all Login URL’s will still point to wp-login.php and users will have to access the New Login Slug by typing it in the browser.
* Disable XML-RPC – An option to simply disable XML-RPC in WordPress. Most of the WordPress users don’t need XML-RPC and can disable it to prevent automated brute force attacks.
* Rename XML-RPC – The Admin can rename the XML-RPC to something different from xmlrpc.php to prevent automated brute force attacks.
* Username Auto Blacklist – Attackers generally use common usernames like admin, administrator, or variations of your domain name / business name. You can specify such username here and Loginizer will auto-blacklist the IP Address(s) of clients who try to use such username(s).
* New Registration Domain Blacklist – If you would like to ban new registrations from a particular domain, you can use this utility to do so.
* Ändra administratörsnamn – Admin kan byta namn på admin-användarnamnet till något svårare.
* Auto Blacklist IPs – IPs will be auto blacklisted, if certain usernames saved by the Admin are used to login by malicious bots / users.
* Inaktivera pingbacks – Enkelt sätt att inaktivera pingBacks.
* SSO – Single Sign-on, let any user access to your WordPress Dashboard without the need to share username or password.
* Limit Concurrent Logins – It prevents user to login from different devices concurrently, you can define how many devices you want to allow, and how you want to restrict the user when concurrent limit is reached.
* Social Login – Users can login or register with their Google, Github, Facebook, X (Twitter), Discord, Twitch, LinkedIn with support for WooCommerce.

Funktioner i Loginizer inkluderar:

* Blockerar IP efter maximal tillåtna försök
* Utökad blockering efter maximal tillåtna försök
* Email notification to admin after max lockouts

The idea of this plugin is good, the simpleness was great, but if it for the compatibility to other plug in, then you must be mindful and careful. I had already use the plugin with the pro version, but when I use it with Elementor, Woocommerce, there are some error to my website because of the change url or slug of the url. I hope in the future there will be more compatible to other plug-in, at least for plug-in that most used.
