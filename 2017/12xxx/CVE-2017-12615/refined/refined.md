Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-12615:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks within the Apache Tomcat server when handling HTTP PUT requests. Specifically, when the `readonly` initialization parameter of the DefaultServlet is set to `false`, a specially crafted HTTP PUT request can bypass file extension checks and upload a JSP file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassed File Extension Check:** The vulnerability exists because the file extension check can be circumvented by appending a `/` character to the end of the filename (e.g., `myfile.jsp/`). This bypass allows a malicious JSP file to be uploaded, even though the regular extension check would have blocked it.
*   **Unrestricted HTTP PUT:**  When the default servlet is set to `readonly=false` which allows PUT method requests.
*   **DefaultServlet's Behavior:**  The `DefaultServlet` attempts to normalize paths by stripping the trailing '/', but it incorrectly checks if a file exists, which in turn causes issues and allows malicious files to be uploaded when path normalization occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious JSP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows for complete compromise of the targeted system, including data manipulation, denial-of-service and potentially lateral movement on a network.
*  **Information Disclosure**: In addition to remote code execution, some source code may be exposed if the `VirtualDirContext` is used, which can reveal additional sensitive information about the target.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP PUT Method:** The primary attack vector is through HTTP PUT requests.
*  **Specially crafted Request URL:** A specially crafted URI is used to bypass the extension check via adding a "/" to the filename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Apache Tomcat server.
*   **Vulnerable Tomcat Version:** The server needs to be running a version of Apache Tomcat between 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 inclusive, or the vulnerable components when using a higher version.
*   **PUT method enabled:** Default servlet needs to be configured with the `readonly` initialization parameter set to `false`, which allows PUT requests
*  **Absence of enforced authentication:** There must not be authentication enforced on the target path where the malicious JSP is being PUT.
*   **OS Requirement:** Specifically targets Windows due to specific file system and path handling.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered a bypass to CVE-2017-12615. The fix for CVE-2017-12615 does not prevent this issue, which is CVE-2017-12617.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entries mention that this issue affects Tomcat on Red Hat Enterprise Linux only when a specific context is configured with `readonly=false`. The default configuration is not affected because the default context is `readonly`, but this can be easily misconfigured by administrators.
*   Mitigation advice includes ensuring that `readonly` is set to true (default), or blocking HTTP methods that permit resource modification for untrusted users.

In summary, CVE-2017-12615 describes a critical vulnerability that allows remote code execution on vulnerable Apache Tomcat servers through a simple trick of adding a `/` character at the end of the file extension in a PUT request.
