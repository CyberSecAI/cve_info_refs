{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses user-supplied input from the `id` parameter in the `download.php` file to construct a file path without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary File Download. The lack of input sanitization on the 'id' parameter allows attackers to specify any file path on the server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download any file accessible to the web server process, potentially exposing sensitive data, source code, configuration files, and other confidential information.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script with a manipulated `id` parameter specifying the path of the file to download.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges are needed besides network access to the vulnerable server."
