{
  "CVE-2017-12148": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in Tower's interface with SCM repositories. If a Tower project (SCM repository) definition does not have the 'delete before update' flag set, an attacker with commit access to the upstream playbook source repository could create a Trojan playbook that, when executed by Tower, modifies the checked out SCM repository to add git hooks. These git hooks could, in turn, cause arbitrary command and code execution as the user Tower runs as.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way Ansible Tower handles updates from SCM repositories, specifically when the 'delete before update' flag is not enabled for a project. This allows for the possibility of injecting malicious code via git hooks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of SCM updates",
      "Lack of sanitization of playbook content",
      "Unrestricted git hook creation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker with commit access to the upstream playbook source repository to achieve arbitrary command and code execution as the user Tower runs as, leading to full system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with commit access to the upstream playbook repository can create a malicious playbook.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Commit access to the upstream playbook source repository"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is present in Ansible Tower. The 'delete before update' flag should be set to prevent this vulnerability."
