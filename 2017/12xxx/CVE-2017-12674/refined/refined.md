  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2017-12674",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing or incomplete input sanitization in the handling of PDB image files. Specifically, a crafted PDB file can cause an endless loop in the `ReadPDBImage` function due to an unchecked offset leading to an infinite loop when reading padding bytes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing input sanitization",
        "Unchecked offset values",
        "Infinite loop vulnerability"
       ],
      "impact": "CPU exhaustion, leading to a denial of service.",
      "attack_vector": "Processing a specially crafted PDB image file.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malformed PDB file to an application using ImageMagick."
