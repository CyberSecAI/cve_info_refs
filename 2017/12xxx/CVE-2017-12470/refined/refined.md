The provided content relates to CVE-2017-12470.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the `ndn_parse_sequence` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `typ` variable should be unsigned, otherwise the check `if (typ < NDN_TLV_MAX_TYPE && ndntlv_recurse[typ])` might fail.
- The `vallen` variable should be unsigned or `size_t` to avoid potential integer overflow issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The content doesn't specify the exact impact of the overflow. It can potentially lead to incorrect length calculations and further memory corruption, potentially causing a denial of service or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specially crafted NDN (Named Data Networking) packets that lead to integer overflow conditions in `ndn_parse_sequence` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted NDN packets to the vulnerable system.
