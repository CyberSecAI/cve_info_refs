Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco Voice Operating System (VOS)-based products when they have been upgraded by using the refresh upgrade (RU) method or migrated by using the Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) method:   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM)   + Cisco Unified Communication Manager Session Management Edition (SME)   + Cisco Emergency Responder   + Cisco Unity Connection   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service (IM&P earlier releases were known as Cisco Unified Presence)   + Cisco Prime License Manager   + Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment   + Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCx)   + Cisco SocialMiner   + Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (UIC)   + Cisco Finesse   + Cisco MediaSenseThe PCD migration method affects only Cisco UCM, SME, and IM&P.Determining the Upgrade or Migration MethodThe Cisco VOS-based products identified in the preceding vulnerable products list are affected by this vulnerability if they were refresh upgraded or migrated by using the PCD methods. Note that a VOS-based product must go through a refresh upgrade if the underlying operating system is also being upgraded to a new major release.      If the VOS-based product was standard upgraded to an Engineering Special, service update, or a new major release of the affected product that does *not* require major upgrades to the underlying operating system, this vulnerability will be remediated by that standard upgrade action.      **Refresh Upgrade Method Verification**      To verify whether the product has been exposed to the vulnerability by the refresh upgrade method, issue the following command at the CLI to view the *system-history.log* file: ```   admin: file view install system-history.log   ```    The following example shows a refresh upgrade entry in the *system-history.log* file: ```   02/28/2013 14:56:05 | root: Upgrade (refresh) 10.0.0.97016-27 Success   ```    The following example shows a standard upgrade entry in the *system-history.log* file: ```   10/13/2017 18:56:07 | root: Upgrade 12.0.1.20000-3 Success   ```    **PCD Migration Method Verification**      To verify whether the product has been exposed to this vulnerability by the PCD migration method, issue the following command at the CLI to view the *install.log* file: ```   admin: file view install install.log   ```    The following example shows a PCD migration log entry in the *install.log* file: ```   10/16/2017 13:59:13 post_install|Starting post_install processing - VOS_INSTALL_CONTEXT = M1|   ```    The following example shows a normal fresh install log entry in the *install.log* file: ```   08/15/2011 08:56:03 post_install|Starting post_install processing - VOS_INSTALL_CONTEXT = install|   ```    **Underlying Operating System Upgraded to a New Major Release**      A VOS-based product will undergo a refresh upgrade if the underlying operating system is also upgraded to a new major release.      The following examples show major operating system releases that are associated with major affected product releases:      | Cisco UCM, Cisco Unity Connection, and Cisco Unified Presence Server/Cisco IM&P Major Release | Operating System Major Release |   | --- | --- |   | 8.6 | RHEL 5 Update 5 |   | 9.x | RHEL 5 Update 7 |   | 10.x | RHEL 6 Update 2 |   | 11.x | RHEL 6 Update 5 |   | 12.x | CentOS 6 Update 6 |         Because an upgrade from RHEL 6 to CentOS 6 is not considered a major operating system release change, product updates between these operating system releases will use the standard upgrade method.      **Prime Collaboration Deployment Cluster Migration**      Prime Collaboration Deployment is a free application that is designed to assist in the management of various Cisco Unified Communications applications. The PCD migrate cluster task is supported only for the following Cisco products and to only certain cluster migration destination versions.   + UCM destination version 10.x, 11.0(1), 11.5(x), 12.0(1)   + IM&P destination version 10.x, 11.0(1), 11.5(x), 12.0(1)   Refer to the product documentation for information about specific upgrade and migration methods.Determining the Current Software Release for the Cisco Unified PlatformThe following Cisco products run on the Cisco Unified platform:   + Unified Communications Manager   + Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition   + Emergency Responder   + Unity Connection   + Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service   + Prime License Manager   + Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment   To determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running on the Cisco Unified platform, an administrator can issue the **show version active** command at the CLI.      In the following example, the software release is 11.5.1.10000-86. ```   ciscocm: show version active   Active Master Version: 11.5.1.10000-86   ```    An administrator can use the user interface to determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running:   1. Log in to the web-based interface   2. Click the **Help** menu   3. Click **About** to view the system software releaseDetermining the Current Software Release for the Cisco Contact Center PlatformThe following Cisco products run on the Cisco Contact Center platform:   + Unified Contact Center Express   + SocialMiner   + Unified Intelligence Center   + Finesse   + MediaSense   To determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running on the Contact Center platform, an administrator can issue the **show version active** command at the CLI.      In the following example, the software release is 11.5.1.10000-86. ```   admin: show version active   Active Master Version: 11.5.1.10000-86   ```    An administrator can use the user interface to determine which Cisco Contact Center platform-based product software release is running:   1. Log in to the Contact Center Express server   2. Go to the Cisco Unified Communications operating system administration window   3. Choose **Show** > **Software**Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:   + Cisco Identity Service (IdS) 11.5 and 11.6   + Cisco Prime Collaboration Deployment   + Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning   + Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance   + Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:    <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html>      Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.   Customers Without Service ContractsCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>      Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 9.8 |
