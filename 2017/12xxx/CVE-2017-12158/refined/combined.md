## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2904)

## Topic

An update for rh-sso7-keycloak is now available for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1 for RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Single Sign-On is a standalone server, based on the Keycloak project, that provides authentication and standards-based single sign-on capabilities for web and mobile applications.

This release of Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1.3 serves as a replacement for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1.2, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. For further information, refer to the Release Notes linked to in the References section.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that keycloak would accept a HOST header URL in the admin console and use it to determine web resource locations. An attacker could use this flaw against an authenticated user to attain reflected XSS via a malicious server. (CVE-2017-12158)
* It was found that the cookie used for CSRF prevention in Keycloak was not unique to each session. An attacker could use this flaw to gain access to an authenticated user session, leading to possible information disclosure or further attacks. (CVE-2017-12159)
* It was found that libpam4j did not properly validate user accounts when authenticating. A user with a valid password for a disabled account would be able to bypass security restrictions and possibly access sensitive information. (CVE-2017-12197)
* It was found that Keycloak oauth would permit an authenticated resource to obtain an access/refresh token pair from the authentication server, permitting indefinite usage in the case of permission revocation. An attacker on an already compromised resource could use this flaw to grant himself continued permissions and possibly conduct further attacks. (CVE-2017-12160)

Red Hat would like to thank Mykhailo Stadnyk (Playtech) for reporting CVE-2017-12158; Prapti Mittal for reporting CVE-2017-12159; and Bart Toersche (Simacan) for reporting CVE-2017-12160. The CVE-2017-12197 issue was discovered by Christian Heimes (Red Hat).

RHSA-2017:2906 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2017-10-17
# RHSA-2017:2906 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Single Sign-On security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1.3 is now available for download from the Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1 is a standalone server, based on the Keycloak project, that provides authentication and standards-based single sign-on capabilities for web and mobile applications. The Node.js adapter provides a simple module for authentication and authorization in Node.js applications.

This release of Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1.3 serves as a replacement for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1.2, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. For further information, refer to the Release Notes linked to in the References section.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that keycloak would accept a HOST header URL in the admin console and use it to determine web resource locations. An attacker could use this flaw against an authenticated user to attain reflected XSS via a malicious server. (CVE-2017-12158)
* It was found that the cookie used for CSRF prevention in Keycloak was not unique to each session. An attacker could use this flaw to gain access to an authenticated user session, leading to possible information disclosure or further attacks. (CVE-2017-12159)
* It was found that libpam4j did not properly validate user accounts when authenticating. A user with a valid password for a disabled account would be able to bypass security restrictions and possibly access sensitive information. (CVE-2017-12197)
* It was found that Keycloak oauth would permit an authenticated resource to obtain an access/refresh token pair from the authentication server, permitting indefinite usage in the case of permission revocation. An attacker on an already compromised resource could use this flaw to grant himself continued permissions and possibly conduct further attacks. (CVE-2017-12160)

Red Hat would like to thank Mykhailo Stadnyk (Playtech) for reporting CVE-2017-12158; Prapti Mittal for reporting CVE-2017-12159; and Bart Toersche (Simacan) for reporting CVE-2017-12160. The CVE-2017-12197 issue was discovered by Christian Heimes (Red Hat).

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including
all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and
so on.

## Topic

An update for rh-sso7-keycloak is now available for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1 for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Single Sign-On is a standalone server, based on the Keycloak project, that provides authentication and standards-based single sign-on capabilities for web and mobile applications.

This release of Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1.3 serves as a replacement for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.1.2, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. For further information, refer to the Release Notes linked to in the References section.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that keycloak would accept a HOST header URL in the admin console and use it to determine web resource locations. An attacker could use this flaw against an authenticated user to attain reflected XSS via a malicious server. (CVE-2017-12158)
* It was found that the cookie used for CSRF prevention in Keycloak was not unique to each session. An attacker could use this flaw to gain access to an authenticated user session, leading to possible information disclosure or further attacks. (CVE-2017-12159)
* It was found that libpam4j did not properly validate user accounts when authenticating. A user with a valid password for a disabled account would be able to bypass security restrictions and possibly access sensitive information. (CVE-2017-12197)
* It was found that Keycloak oauth would permit an authenticated resource to obtain an access/refresh token pair from the authentication server, permitting indefinite usage in the case of permission revocation. An attacker on an already compromised resource could use this flaw to grant himself continued permissions and possibly conduct further attacks. (CVE-2017-12160)

Red Hat would like to thank Mykhailo Stadnyk (Playtech) for reporting CVE-2017-12158; Prapti Mittal for reporting CVE-2017-12159; and Bart Toersche (Simacan) for reporting CVE-2017-12160. The CVE-2017-12197 issue was discovered by Christian Heimes (Red Hat).

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)
