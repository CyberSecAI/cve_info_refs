- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to a loop counter being directly controlled by attacker-provided data within a PCX file, leading to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a classic out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). Specifically, the size of data written into a buffer is not validated and the loop counter for this write operation is controlled by data from the PCX file, which is controlled by the attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption and potentially code execution. This could allow an attacker to compromise the affected system by running arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted PCX file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PCX file to a vulnerable instance of Photoline. The user needs to open the malicious PCX file on the vulnerable system.
