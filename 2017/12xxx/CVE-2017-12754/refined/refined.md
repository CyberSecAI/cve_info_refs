The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12754.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `deleteOfflineClient` function of the httpd web server on ASUS routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `deleteOfflineClient` function in `web.c` doesn't properly validate the length of the `delete_offline_client` parameter received in a GET request. This parameter is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer (`mac_str[13]`) without a length check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By sending a crafted `delete_offline_client` parameter with a length greater than the buffer's capacity, an attacker can overwrite the stack. This allows them to overwrite the saved return address ($ra) and gain control of the program's execution flow ($pc), potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to the `deleteOfflineClient.cgi` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to either have a valid session with the router web interface or use a session hijacking or CSRF attack to bypass authentication before exploiting the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running on the router (local network access).

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is in `release/src/router/httpd/web.c`.
- The `deleteOfflineClient()` function parses the `delete_offline_client` parameter from the URL.
- The `websGetVar` function retrieves the value of `delete_offline_client` parameter, but no length check is performed before copying it into `mac_str[13]`.
- The provided Proof-of-Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request with an oversized `delete_offline_client` parameter.
- The GDB trace confirms that the return address (ra) and program counter (pc) are overwritten with attacker-controlled values.
- The vulnerability is exploitable for remote command execution after exploiting the stack overflow.
