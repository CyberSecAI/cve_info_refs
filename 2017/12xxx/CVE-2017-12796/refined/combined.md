## OpenMRS Security Advisory

Severity: **Critical**
Exploit: allows Remote Code Execution without needing to log in.

## What versions are affected?

Html Form Entry module (all versions)
Reporting compatibility module (all versions)
OpenMRS Reference Application (all versions)

## Recommendations

Anyone running the html form entry or reporting compatibility module (included in the Reference Application) should immediately upgrade to the latest released versions of the modules, which are available [here](https://addons.openmrs.org).

This includes anyone running any version of the OpenMRS Reference Application, as well as anyone who has installed the above modules on top of an OpenMRS Platform release, a new version of the reference application is available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmrs/files/releases/OpenMRS_Reference_Application_2.6.1/).

A huge thank you goes out to [@isears](/u/isears) who and his team identified the vulnerabilities and worked with us to get them addressed.
