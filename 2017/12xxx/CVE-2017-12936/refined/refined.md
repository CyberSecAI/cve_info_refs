Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-12936:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free in `ReadWMFImage` function within `coders/wmf.c` of GraphicsMagick.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed in the error reporting path of the `ReadWMFImage` function. Specifically, it tries to use a `ddata->image` which has already been freed in the `wmf_lite_destroy` function via `cfree`.
- The root cause of the use-after-free is due to a mishandling of the `image->exception` when an error occurs during WMF image processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash due to a heap-use-after-free error.
- This can be used to cause a denial of service by crashing the application.
- It is possible that further exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted WMF (Windows Metafile) image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious WMF image to a GraphicsMagick application.
- No specific privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability, but some level of interaction with the image processing function is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
- The vulnerability affects GraphicsMagick version 1.3.26.
- A fix for this vulnerability is available in commit `be898b7c97bd` of the GraphicsMagick repository.
