- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Circle with Disney device uses only the ESSID to identify the configured access point and does not verify the encryption type against its stored configuration when reconnecting to Wi-Fi.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device does not properly validate the security configuration of the Wi-Fi network when reconnecting. It uses the ESSID to identify the network and trusts whatever encryption type is reported in the scan result, even if it doesn't match the stored configuration. This allows a downgrade attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By connecting to a malicious, attacker-controlled access point, the device no longer filters internet traffic on the original network. Additionally, this could allow attackers to conduct further attacks against the device and the network it is connected to.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed over Wi-Fi by setting up a rogue access point with the same ESSID as the legitimate network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the Circle with Disney device and must be able to create a rogue access point with the same SSID as the target network. The attacker needs to be able to send deauthentication packets to force the device to reconnect.
