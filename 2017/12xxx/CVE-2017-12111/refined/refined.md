Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12111:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in the `xls_addCell` function of `libxls`. Specifically, the function does not properly validate the `col` field of a "FORMULA (Apple Numbers Bug)" record (ID `0x0406`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The `col` value from a crafted "FORMULA (Apple Numbers Bug)" record, which is not validated, is used as an index into the `row->cells.cell` array. If this value is larger than the array's bounds, a write out-of-bounds occurs.
- **Lack of input validation:** The `xls_preparseWorkSheet` function does not process records with ID `0x0406`, and therefore, the maximum row and column values are not updated for this type of record. This results in the `xls_addCell` function not having the correct bounds when writing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:**  Due to memory corruption from the out-of-bounds write, a remote attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of service:** If code execution is not possible, the memory corruption can crash the application, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious XLS file:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted XLS file with a specific formula record (ID `0x0406`) which contains a large value in the `col` field.
- **User interaction**: An attacker needs to entice a user to open the malicious XLS file using an application that is using the vulnerable libxls library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious XLS file.
- The attacker needs to be able to make a victim open the crafted XLS file using a vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs because `xls_preparseWorkSheet` function does not process records with ID `0x0406` while the `xls_parseWorkSheet` function calls the vulnerable `xls_addCell` function when such record is encountered.
- The `col` field from the record is used as the index when accessing the `cell` array of a row.
- The vulnerable code is located within the `xls_addCell` function. Specifically, at lines where cell->id and cell->xf fields are set.
- Crash information provides details about the segmentation fault when writing outside the allocated memory.
