The content is related to CVE-2017-12106.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption in the .TGA parsing functionality of Computerinsel Photoline 20.02. A dword value taken directly from the .TGA file is used as a loop repeat number, leading to a memcpy operation in each iteration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787). Specifically, a buffer overflow occurs during the memcpy operation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can send a specially crafted .TGA file to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .TGA file to be processed by the vulnerable software. No specific access or privileges are mentioned. The user needs to open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
