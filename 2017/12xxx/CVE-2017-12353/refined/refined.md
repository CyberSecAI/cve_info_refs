Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) header filtering functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate filtering of SMTP headers, allowing for a bypass of configured user filters.
- The specific mechanism of the bypass isn't detailed in the provided documents, but it involves the processing of SMTP headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass configured user filters on the affected Cisco ESA device.
- This could lead to the delivery of unwanted or malicious emails that should have been blocked by the configured filters.
- The integrity of the system is impacted, as the configured email filtering rules are not applied as intended.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker sends crafted emails to the vulnerable ESA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a vulnerable Cisco ESA device.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker does not need any prior knowledge of the network other than the email server's public interface to send emails.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information also includes a CVSS score of 5.8 (Medium severity) with the vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
- Workarounds such as enabling email authentication mechanisms (FED, SPF, DKIM, DMARC) are suggested as mitigation.
- This vulnerability was reported to the Cisco PSIRT by Mai Ngoc Duong.
