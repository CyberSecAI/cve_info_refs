Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2017-12983:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to memory handling problems and incomplete input sanitization when processing image files. Specifically, a heap buffer overflow occurs in the `ReadSFWImage` function of ImageMagick when processing a crafted SFW file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow in `ReadSFWImage` function.
- Missing or incomplete input sanitizing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service.
- Memory disclosure.
- Potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted SFW image file.
- Attackers can entice a user or automated system to process the malformed image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted image file to be processed by ImageMagick.
- The attacker needs to be able to make the vulnerable application process the malicious file (e.g., through a web interface, email attachment or local file processing).

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of ImageMagick prior to 6.9.9.20 and 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u3.
- The provided Github issue #682 contains a crash report which shows the exact line number where the overflow occurs in the `CopyMagickMemory` function when called from `ReadSFWImage` while processing a malicious file.
