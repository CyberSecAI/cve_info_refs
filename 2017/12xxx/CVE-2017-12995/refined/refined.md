{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The DNS parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 could enter an infinite loop due to a bug in print-domain.c:ns_print(). The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of DNS compression pointers, specifically when a pointer points backwards in the packet, leading to an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-835"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an infinite loop in the DNS parser, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted DNS packet to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump."
