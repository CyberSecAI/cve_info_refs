Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of unintentional expressions within Freemarker tags in Apache Struts. Specifically, when a developer uses a writable property directly in the `value` attribute of a Struts tag (e.g., `<@s.hidden name="redirectUri" value=redirectUri />`) or explicitly uses Freemarker's expression syntax `${}` in the `value` attribute, the provided value is interpreted as a Freemarker expression instead of a literal string. If the expression refers to a user-controlled request parameter, it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Expression Language Injection:** The core weakness is that user-controlled input is being evaluated as an expression within the Freemarker template engine.
*   **Unsafe Freemarker Tag Usage:** Using writable properties or Freemarker expression syntax directly within the `value` attribute of Struts tags without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious expressions via request parameters that are then processed by Freemarker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameters:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code within the value of HTTP request parameters. These parameters are then used in the vulnerable Freemarker tag.
    * Example: `<@s.hidden name="redirectUri" value="${some_request_parameter}"/>` and `some_request_parameter` is set to a malicious expression in the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Apache Struts application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:** The attacker needs to identify or guess the parameter names used within the vulnerable Freemarker tags in the application's code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content highlights the difference between the vulnerable Freemarker expressions and the safe Struts expression evaluation style that uses the `%{}` syntax.
*   The content emphasizes the need to avoid such constructions and the use of read-only properties within the Freemarker tag `value` attributes.
*   The document recommends upgrading to Apache Struts version 2.5.12 or 2.3.34, which have more restricted Freemarker configuration. However, removing vulnerable code is preferred.

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2017-12611, which involves RCE through the use of Freemarker expression injection within Apache Struts.
