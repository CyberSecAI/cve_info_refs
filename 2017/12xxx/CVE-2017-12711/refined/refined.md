The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12711.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An incorrect privilege assignment is granted to a built-in user account, allowing potential privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect privilege assignment (CWE-266). A built-in user account has a sensitive privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation, potentially granting an attacker administrative rights. This could lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required (AV:L).
- Low attack complexity (AC:L).
- Low privileges are required (PR:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access and a low-privileged user account on the target system. No user interaction is required.
