Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12104:

**Root Cause:**
- Integer overflow in the calculation of buffer size when drawing a `ParticleSystem` object with `PART_DRAW_AXIS` type. This leads to undersized heap buffer allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: Arithmetic calculations involving `totpart`, `totchild`, and `part->disp` can overflow, leading to a smaller-than-required allocation size.
- Heap-based Buffer Overflow: When writing particle data to the undersized buffers, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The heap-based buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Blender application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious .blend File: An attacker can create a specially crafted .blend file containing a malicious `ParticleSystem` object designed to trigger the integer overflow.
- User Interaction: The victim needs to open the malicious .blend file, import it as a library, or run it via the blender executable, causing the vulnerable code to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify .blend files.
- Must convince a user to open the crafted file using a vulnerable version of Blender.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is in the `draw_new_particle_system` function within `source/blender/editors/space_view3d/drawobject.c`.
- Specifically, the integer overflow occurs when calculating `tot_vec_size`.
- The undersized buffer is allocated using `MEM_callocN`.
- The buffer overflow occurs when writing data to the undersized `pdd->vdata`, `pdd->cdata`, or `pdd->ndata` fields in `draw_particle` function.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by setting the `part->draw_as` field to `PART_DRAW_AXIS(4)`.
- The PoC provided uses `totchild` and `totpart` fields to cause the overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Blender v2.78c (32-bit), however it was not stated if other versions are affected.
- The provided proof-of-concept can be used to generate malicious .blend files to exploit the vulnerability.
- Mitigation involves avoiding the use of untrusted .blend files.
- The `Talos` report includes a detailed crash information and stack trace.
