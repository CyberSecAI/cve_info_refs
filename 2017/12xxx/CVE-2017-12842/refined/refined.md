  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2017-12842",
    "description": "The Bitcoin Merkle tree design has a weakness where the distinction between inner nodes and leaf nodes is not enforced. This allows an attacker to create a 64-byte transaction, and then force a victim system to re-interpret this transaction as an inner node of the tree. This could lead to a crafted SPV proof that could be used to trick the victim into accepting a fake payment as valid.",
    "root_cause": "Bitcoin Merkle tree makes no distinction between inner nodes and leaf nodes. The depth of the tree is implicitly given by the number of transactions. Inner nodes have no specific format, and are 64 bytes in length.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Lack of distinction between inner and leaf nodes in Merkle trees allows for transaction reinterpretation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a valid SPV proof for a fake payment to a victim using an SPV wallet, potentially leading to the acceptance of invalid transactions. An attacker can also fork the Bitcoin blockchain although this attack is computationally impractical.",
      "attack_vector": "By submitting a specially crafted 64-byte transaction to the blockchain. The attacker then provides a manipulated SPV proof that misinterprets this transaction as a Merkle tree node, allowing them to claim any transaction is included in the block.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network. The attacker must also be able to control a mining node to confirm blocks containing the crafted transactions. The attacker would need to perform a brute-force attack.",
