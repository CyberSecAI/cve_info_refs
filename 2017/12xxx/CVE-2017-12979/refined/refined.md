Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `_highlight` function within `/inc/parser/xhtml.php`. Specifically, the code does not properly sanitize or validate the language parameter when rendering code blocks. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes within the `<pre>` tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. An attacker can inject malicious code into the wiki content by manipulating the `language` parameter in a code block. When this content is rendered, the injected JavaScript will execute in the victim's browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or properly escape the input received as a code block's language, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions including, but not limited to:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    - Redirecting the victim to malicious websites
    - Modifying content on the page
- **Privilege Escalation:** In the case described, an attacker can force an admin user to enable phpok through malicious javascript. This is an unusual impact, but it illustrates the power an attacker may gain via XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Code Block:** The attacker crafts a code block using a malicious `language` attribute such as `abc"onmouseover="alert(1)`. When the code block is rendered, the `onmouseover` event will execute the JavaScript `alert(1)`
- **Wiki Page Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious code into a wiki page, which is then stored on the server. When a victim (admin or other user) views that page, the stored XSS payload is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create or Modify Wiki Content:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit pages within the DokuWiki instance. This often requires user account privileges or some other method to inject content into the system.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$this->doc .= "<pre class=\"$class $language\">".p_xhtml_cached_geshi($text, $language, '').'</pre>'.DOKU_LF;
```
The `$language` variable is directly inserted into the `class` attribute of the `<pre>` tag, without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML attributes, including event handlers such as `onmouseover`.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
```
<code abc"onmouseover="alert(1)>
stored xss
</code>
```
This PoC shows that by injecting the above code block, the attacker can achieve code execution on the user browser once the content is rendered.
