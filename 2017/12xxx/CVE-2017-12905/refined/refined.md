Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `Launderer.php` file of the Pixie Image Editor. The script takes a `url` parameter from a POST request and passes it directly to `curl_exec` or `file_get_contents` without any sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to control the URL used in these functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. By manipulating the `url` parameter, an attacker can force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can use the `file://` protocol to read local files from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the serverâ€™s file system, which could contain configuration files, passwords, or other sensitive data.
- **Internal Network Scanning:** By using protocols such as `dict`, `gopher`, `ldap`, the attacker can scan internal network ports. This could lead to discovery of vulnerable services within the internal network.
- **Attacking Internal Network Vulnerable Servers:** Using the SSRF vulnerability, an attacker can make requests to internal servers, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities that are not directly accessible from the outside internet.
- **Possible Remote Command Execution:** The vulnerability may, in some cases, lead to remote command execution, although the specific vector is not detailed in this report.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the `launderer.php` file, where the attacker controls the `url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `launderer.php` endpoint.
- No prior authentication or specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 1.4 and 1.7 of Pixie Image Editor.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using multiple protocols, including `file`, `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `gopher`, `tftp`, `dict`, `ldap`, `imap`, `pop3`, `smtp`, and `telnet`.
- The vulnerability may be limited to `http`, `https`, and `ftp` protocols if curl functions are unavailable.
- This vulnerability requires the `allow_url_fopen` option to be enabled in PHP. This setting is enabled by default in most PHP installations.
