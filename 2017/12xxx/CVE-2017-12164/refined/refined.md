Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the GNOME Display Manager (gdm) where the `ran_once` boolean is not being set correctly during autologin. This issue occurs specifically when there's a fallback from Wayland to X11 during the autologin process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Handling of `ran_once` Flag:** The core issue is that the `ran_once` flag, which should prevent the autologin process from being re-attempted unnecessarily, was not being properly set when the system falls back from Wayland to X11.
- **Circumvention of Lock Screen:** Due to the missing `ran_once` flag, after a user with autologin enabled locks their screen, an attacker can bypass the lock screen by simply selecting the "log in as another user" option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to a locked user session without needing the user's password or credentials. This bypasses the intended security mechanism of the lock screen.
- **Compromised User Session:** Once the lock screen is bypassed, the attacker has full access to the victim's user session, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker having physical access to the machine. They need to be able to reach the locked screen and interact with the login prompt.
- **Autologin Enabled User:** The target must have autologin enabled for their account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the victim's machine.
- **Basic User Interaction:** They need the ability to interact with the login screen and select the "log in as another user" option.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not require the victim's password or any other credentials.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was introduced by a commit in the gdm project ([https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdm/commit/?id=ff98b28](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdm/commit/?id=ff98b28)). This commit attempted to fix a separate autologin issue but introduced this vulnerability as a side effect.
- The issue specifically affects systems where gdm falls back from Wayland to X11 during the autologin process.
- Red Hat initially classified this as "NOTABUG" because the vulnerable commit was not part of the gdm version shipped with RHEL 7, 6, or 5.

In summary, CVE-2017-12164 is a significant flaw that allows an attacker with physical access to bypass the lock screen on systems with gdm and autologin enabled, leading to a compromise of user sessions.
