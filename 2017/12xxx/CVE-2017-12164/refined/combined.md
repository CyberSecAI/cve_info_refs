| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1490417#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2017-09-11 13:51:34 UTC  ``` The gnome lock screen can be unlocked without needing a password.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enable Automatic Login for your account 2. Reboot 3. Lock screen 4. Click on the log in as another user button below the password prompt.  Actual results: The screen unlocks without a password being entered.  Expected results: A selection of other accounts is shown.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1490417#c1)  Cedric Buissart    2017-09-12 08:53:00 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is a side effect of upstream <https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdm/commit/?id=ff98b28>, in gdm-3.24.1. This patch is not part of gdm as shipped in RHEL 7, 6 or 5. As such, RHEL is not affected by this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1490417#c2)  Cedric Buissart    2017-09-12 09:13:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Tobias Guggenmos   ``` |  |

### manager: if falling back to X11 retry autologin

```

Right now, we get one shot to autologin. If it fails, we fall back to
the greeter.  We should give it another go if the reason for the failure
was wayland fallback to X.
