The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12089.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the program download functionality of Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B PLCs. Specifically, if the 'Execute Command List' packet is sent without the subsequent 'download complete' packet, the PLC enters a fault state. This is due to errors encountered when attempting to obtain and lock editing rights during the program download.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper resource management during the program download process.
- Lack of proper handling of incomplete download sequences.
- Failure to release resources when the download process is not completed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS).
- PLC halts operation and enters a fault state.
- Device becomes unavailable and needs manual intervention to recover.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Unauthenticated packet can be sent over the network to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network connectivity to the target PLC.
- Ability to send crafted packets to the PLC.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending an 'Execute Command List' packet without the 'download complete' packet.
- The device will halt in the download state for one minute and then transition into the fault state.
- The proof of concept exploit provided shows how to send the required packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- The tested versions are Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B FRN 21.2, 21.0 and 15.
- The PLC must be in REMOTE keyswitch mode to be vulnerable.
