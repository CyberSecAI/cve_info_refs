- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the incorrect behavior order during the processing of SNMP-set commands related to firmware updates. Specifically, sending an SNMP-set request to set the OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.95.2.3.1.1.1.1.0 to the integer 2 triggers a device reboot without initiating a firmware flash.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect behavior order in the handling of SNMP-set requests related to firmware updates. Sending a specific SNMP-set command triggers a reboot without a flash operation.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by forcing the device to power cycle, resulting in downtime.

- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted SNMP-set request to the vulnerable device via network.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device and knowledge of a valid SNMP community string (or the backdoor string 'wheel' which is disclosed in CVE-2016-5645). The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a single malicious packet.
