The provided content is related to CVE-2017-12093.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insufficient resource pool in the session communication functionality of Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B PLC. The PLC has a limited number of concurrent connection slots (10), and new connections are managed by disconnecting the oldest one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient Resource Pool (CWE-410) in managing session connections.
- Lack of proper handling of a large number of connection requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting available connection slots, preventing legitimate users from accessing the PLC.
- Legitimate connections to the PLC can be disconnected.
- The PLC continues to operate in its previous state but becomes inaccessible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a stream of specially crafted "Register Session" packets to the PLC via TCP over port 44818.
- The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the PLC.
- No specific privileges or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must know the IP address of the target PLC.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit can be achieved by repeatedly sending the 'Register Session' packet.
- The provided proof-of-concept code in Python demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Allen Bradley Micrologix 1400 Series B Firmware versions 21.2 and before.
- When a legitimate session is disconnected, the user is notified and can attempt to reconnect, but the malicious traffic will likely disconnect the legitimate session again.
