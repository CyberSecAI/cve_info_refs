```text
- Root cause of vulnerability: Timing differences in the login and password reset process reveal user existence.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: User enumeration vulnerability via timing attack.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can identify valid usernames on the system, which can be used for further attacks, like brute-forcing passwords
- Attack vectors: Login and password reset forms
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to access the login and password reset forms and be able to measure response times.
