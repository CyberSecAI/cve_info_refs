{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `ReadDCMImage` function in `coders/dcm.c` of ImageMagick.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "An integer overflow occurs when calculating the memory allocation size for image data.",
      "The condition `if (~length >= 1)` is intended to check for a negative length, but due to integer overflow, a large positive number can be passed, resulting in a too small memory allocation."
    ],
    "impact": "A heap buffer overflow during memory allocation, potentially leading to a denial of service or code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted DCM image files."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted DCM image file to an application using ImageMagick. No special position or elevated privileges are required."
