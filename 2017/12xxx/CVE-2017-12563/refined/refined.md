Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2017-12563:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory exhaustion issue in the `ReadPSDImage` function of ImageMagick when processing PSD files.
- The `length` variable, which determines the amount of memory to allocate, is read from the image file and can be controlled by a malicious actor.
- ImageMagick allocates memory based on the attacker-controlled `length` value without proper validation, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption and denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption: The program doesn't properly limit the amount of memory allocated for processing a PSD file, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service by providing a crafted file that requires an excessive amount of memory.
- Missing input sanitization: The size of memory to allocate is read directly from the input file without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): By providing a specially crafted PSD file, an attacker can cause ImageMagick to allocate large amounts of memory, leading to a crash due to memory exhaustion and preventing it from processing other images.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted PSD file to ImageMagick, triggering the vulnerable `ReadPSDImage` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted PSD file to an ImageMagick instance. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
  - Uploading the malicious file to a web application that uses ImageMagick for image processing.
  - Sending the malicious file to a user who then processes it via ImageMagick.
  - Having the system process the malicious file automatically.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Github issue includes a test case and demonstrates how the vulnerability can be triggered.
- The `policy.xml` memory limits, designed to prevent this type of attack, are bypassed.
- This issue can lead to complete denial of service of the ImageMagick process.
- Several sources mention that this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, however, the supplied information does not provide direct evidence of arbitrary code execution.
