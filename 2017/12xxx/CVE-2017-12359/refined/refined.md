Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player when processing Advanced Recording Format (*.arf*) files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-119:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Buffer Overflow). This means that the software doesn't properly validate the size of input data before writing it to a buffer, potentially overflowing the buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a system by exploiting the buffer overflow. This could lead to a variety of impacts including:
    - Complete compromise of the user's system.
    - Installation of malware.
    - Data exfiltration or manipulation.
    - Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious Advanced Recording Format (*.arf*) file.
- The attacker would need to deliver this malicious file to a user, typically via:
    - Email
    - A URL (e.g., a link to download the file from a website)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious file to the target user. They don't need direct access to the user's system or network.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open or launch the malicious *.arf* file using the vulnerable WebEx Network Recording Player.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow that can be triggered by a user opening a specially crafted ARF file. The attacker must rely on social engineering to get the user to open the file but doesn't require any network access to the vulnerable system. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution, meaning the attacker could take over the user's computer.
