The provided content relates to CVE-2017-12473.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `ccnl_ccntlv_bytes2pkt` function. Specifically, the code does not properly check the length (`L`) values of incoming packets, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes, and subsequent program crashes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper bounds checks when parsing packet length (`L`) values.
- Vulnerability exists in lines 160 and 276 of the `ccnl_ccntlv_bytes2pkt` function.
- Incorrect length values could trigger out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to incorrect memory access.
- Potential denial-of-service (DoS) if an attacker can trigger the crash repeatedly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting malicious packets with incorrect length values.
- Sending these crafted packets to the vulnerable `ccnl_ccntlv_bytes2pkt` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a system running the vulnerable code.
- The attacker must have knowledge about the packet format and how to construct packets with invalid length values.
