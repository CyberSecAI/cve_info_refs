| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1477651#c0)  Adam MariÅ¡    2017-08-02 14:36:33 UTC  ``` ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The grant table code in Xen has a bespoke semi-lockfree allocator for recording grant mappings ("maptrack" entries).  This allocator has a race which allows the free list to be corrupted.  Specifically: the code for removing an entry from the free list, prior to use, assumes (without locking) that if inspecting head item shows that it is not the tail, it will continue to not be the tail of the list if it is later found to be still the head and removed with cmpxchg.  But the entry might have been removed and replaced, with the result that it might be the tail by then.  (The invariants for the semi-lockfree data structure were never formally documented.)  Additionally, a stolen entry is put on the free list with an incorrect link field, which will very likely corrupt the list.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator can crash the host, and can probably escalate their privilege to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Xen 4.6 and later are vulnerable.  Xen 4.5 and earlier are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no mitigation for this vulnerability.

    polling, resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2017-10918

    physical-to-machine memory mappings may result in privilege
    escalation, denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2017-10919

    Julien Grall discovered that that incorrect handling of
    virtual interrupt injection on ARM systems may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2017-10920 / CVE-2017-10921 / CVE-2017-10922

    Jan Beulich discovered multiple places where reference
    counting on grant table operations was incorrect, resulting
    in potential privilege escalation

CVE-2017-12135

    Jan Beulich found multiple problems in the handling of
    transitive grants which could result in denial of service
    and potentially privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12136

    Ian Jackson discovered that race conditions in the allocator
    for grant mappings may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation. This only affects Debian stretch.

CVE-2017-12137

    Andrew Cooper discovered that incorrect validation of
    grants may result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12855

    Jan Beulich discovered that incorrect grant status handling, thus
    incorrectly informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use.

XSA-235 (no CVE yet)

    Wei Liu discovered that incorrect locking of add-to-physmap
    operations on ARM may result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.4.1-9+deb8u10.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.1-1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201801-14**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, the worst of which
could allow for privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.9.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.9.1-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.9.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.9.1-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the Xen (QEMU) process on the host, gain privileges on the
host system, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.9.1-r1"

```

All Xen tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.9.1-r1"

```

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2017-12136 / XSA-228
                               version 3

     grant_table: Race conditions with maptrack free list handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The grant table code in Xen has a bespoke semi-lockfree allocator for
recording grant mappings ("maptrack" entries).  This allocator has a
race which allows the free list to be corrupted.

Specifically: the code for removing an entry from the free list, prior
to use, assumes (without locking) that if inspecting head item shows
that it is not the tail, it will continue to not be the tail of the
list if it is later found to be still the head and removed with
cmpxchg.  But the entry might have been removed and replaced, with the
result that it might be the tail by then.  (The invariants for the
semi-lockfree data structure were never formally documented.)

Additionally, a stolen entry is put on the free list with an incorrect
link field, which will very likely corrupt the list.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can crash the host, and can probably
escalate their privilege to that of the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.6 and later are vulnerable.

Xen 4.5 and earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation for this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Ian Jackson of Citrix.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
