- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain read access to system files, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** A simple GET request can be used to perform a directory traversal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and requires a low skill level to exploit the vulnerability. No specific privileges or user interaction is needed.
