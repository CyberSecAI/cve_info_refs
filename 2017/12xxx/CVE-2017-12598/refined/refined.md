Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-12598:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from issues in how OpenCV handles image data during reading, specifically within the `cv::imread` function.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing malformed image files, leading to memory corruption issues during the decoding process.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability involves an out-of-bounds write error, a heap-based buffer overflow and incorrect integer casts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The code attempts to write to memory locations outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow**: Occurs when copying data into a buffer that is too small, overwriting adjacent heap memory.
*  **Integer Overflow**: Incorrect integer cast, that leads to out of bound memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption issues can cause the application to crash due to a segmentation fault.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability can potentially be used to overwrite memory regions, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image Files:** The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted image file that exploits the parsing logic within OpenCV.
*   **File Format:** The vulnerable code is present in the BMP decoding routines (`grfmt_bmp.cpp`) and related functions in the `bitstrm.cpp` and `utils.cpp` files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** An attacker would need the ability to provide a malformed image file as input to an application using the vulnerable version of OpenCV.
*   **No special privileges:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring any special privileges.
*   **Target interaction:** An attacker will need the user or process to parse the provided image using OpenCV imread functionality.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was found in OpenCV versions 3.3 and earlier and also affects 2.x versions.
*   The specific function calls involved are `cv::imread`, `cv::BmpDecoder::readData`, `cv::RLByteStream::getBytes`, and `FillColorRow4`.
*   The provided valgrind output shows the exact location of the error.
*   The issue was confirmed using fuzzing techniques.

The provided information gives specific insights into the vulnerable functions and the type of memory corruption caused.
