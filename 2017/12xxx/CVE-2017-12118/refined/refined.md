- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization checks in the implementation of the `miner_stop` API within cpp-ethereum's JSON-RPC server. This allows a remote attacker without credentials to trigger functionality intended for users with administrator privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Lack of authorization checks in the `miner_stop` API.
  - The JSON-RPC interface is bound to 0.0.0.0 by default, exposing it to the world.
  - The `Content-Type` header enforcement is missing, making it vulnerable to CSRF or SSRF attacks.
  - There is no option to change the default JSON-RPC interface to localhost.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can remotely stop the mining process of an Ethereum node by exploiting the `miner_stop` API without any authentication.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Sending a crafted JSON request to the exposed JSON-RPC interface.
  - CSRF or SSRF attacks due to missing `Content-Type` header enforcement.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the exposed JSON-RPC interface.
  - No authentication is required.
