"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over an Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or potentially corrupt the BGP routing table, which could result in network instability.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists due to changes in the implementation of the BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432) [\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7432\"] draft between IOS XE software releases. When the BGP Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address length field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP session was established. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either outcome would result in a DoS.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer, or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171103-bgp [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171103-bgp\"]"

"text": "This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco IOS XE Software prior to software release 16.3 that support BGP EVPN configurations. If the device is not configured for EVPN, it is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\nios-xe-device# show version\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Sun 27-Mar-16 21:47 by mcpre\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html\"].

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Cisco will continue to provide fixes for affected releases as they become available.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in IOS XE software releases 16.3 and later.\r\n\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"http://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"http://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2—in the following field:"

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XE Software Ethernet Virtual Private Network Border Gateway Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20171103-bgp  First Published: 2017 November 3 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2022 December 16 21:17 GMT  Version 1.2:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCui67191](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui67191)  [CSCvg52875](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg52875)     CVE-2017-12319     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 6.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2017-12319     CWE-20       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171103-bgp/csaf/cisco-sa-20171103-bgp.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over an Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or potentially corrupt the BGP routing table, which could result in network instability.  The vulnerability exists due to changes in the implementation of the [BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7432) draft between IOS XE software releases. When the BGP Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address length field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP session was established. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either outcome would result in a DoS.The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer, or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.  The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171103-bgp>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco IOS XE Software prior to software release 16.3 that support BGP EVPN configurations. If the device is not configured for EVPN, it is not vulnerable.**Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release**To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays *Cisco IOS Software*, *Cisco IOS XE Software*, or similar text.The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of *CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M*:    ```   ios-xe-device# show versionCisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Sun 27-Mar-16 21:47 by mcpre...   ```    For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html).

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software and Cisco NX-OS Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Cisco will continue to provide fixes for affected releases as they become available.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Cisco IOS XE Software**  This vulnerability is fixed in IOS XE software releases 16.3 and later.  To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](http://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](http://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2**-in the following field:  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * In March 2022, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) became aware of additional attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 6.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 6.8 |
