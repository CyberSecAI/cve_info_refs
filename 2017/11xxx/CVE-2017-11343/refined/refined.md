- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The initial symbol table randomization factor is generated before the PRNG is initialized, resulting in a constant randomization value across different runs. This means that the symbol table hash buckets will be the same, every time the application is executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect randomization of the symbol table leading to a predictable hash function. This makes the hash table vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft arbitrary symbols that all hash to the same bucket, causing the hash table to perform a linear search, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker who can create arbitrary symbols can exploit the weakness
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create arbitrary symbols.
