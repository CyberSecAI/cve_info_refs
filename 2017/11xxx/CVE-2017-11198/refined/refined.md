The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS, and CVE-2017-11198 is listed as one of them. However, there is no specific detail provided for CVE-2017-11198 itself. The content includes information on the following vulnerabilities:

1.  **Reflected XSS in `get_image.php`**:
    *   **Root cause**: The script does not validate, sanitize, or encode the `$_POST['id']`, `$_POST['name']`, and `$_GET['folder']` parameters.
    *   **Weaknesses**: Lack of input sanitization and output encoding.
    *   **Impact**:  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.
    *   **Attack vector**: Crafted URL with malicious script in the `folder` parameter and POST request with malicious content in the 'id' and 'name' parameters.
    *   **Attacker capabilities**: Ability to craft HTTP requests.

2.  **Arbitrary File Modification**:
    *   **Root cause**: The template css and script modification functions allow modification of the filename leading to arbitrary file modification.
    *   **Weaknesses**: Lack of validation on the filename being modified.
    *   **Impact**:  An attacker can modify existing files to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Attack vector**: HTTP POST request with a malicious filename and content to `/index.php?route=style`, `/index.php?route=script`, or `/index.php?route=template`.
    *   **Attacker capabilities**: Ability to send HTTP POST requests with specific parameters.

3.  **Authenticated SQL Injection**:
    *   **Root cause**: The `visitor_ip` is inserted into the database without any validation, sanitization, or encoding. Additionally, the application uses `mysqli` for database interaction instead of `PDO` in certain sections which causes an SQL injection.
    *  **Weaknesses**: Lack of input sanitization in `application/core/controller/excludes.php` and `stat/get_stat_data.php`.
    *   **Impact**: An attacker can use SQL injection payloads to extract data from the database.
    *   **Attack vector**: HTTP POST request with a malicious SQL payload in the `visitor_ip` parameter to `/index.php?route=excludes&action=add` and then visiting `/stat/get_stat_data.php`.
    *   **Attacker capabilities**: Ability to send HTTP POST requests.

4. **Stored XSS in `images.php`:**
    *   **Root cause**: The application stores user-supplied filetype information in the database and outputs it without sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses**: Lack of sanitization on user-supplied filetype information.
    *   **Impact**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user viewing images.
    *   **Attack vector**: Uploading an image and modifying its file type to contain a javascript payload.
    *   **Attacker capabilities**: Ability to upload files and modify their type, requires admin access.

5.  **Stored XSS in `visitors.php`**:
    *   **Root cause**: The application stores the full URL, including query parameters, of visitors and outputs it without sanitization in the visitors log.
    *   **Weaknesses**: Lack of sanitization on the full URL that visitors access.
    *   **Impact**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when the administrator views the visitors log.
    *   **Attack vector**: Visiting a page with JavaScript code in the URL which will then be stored.
    *  **Attacker capabilities**: Ability to visit a web page.
