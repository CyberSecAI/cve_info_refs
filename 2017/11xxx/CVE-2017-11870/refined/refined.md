{
  "CVE-2017-11870": {
    "Root cause": "Incorrect handling of function declarations within a block scope in the Chakra JIT engine.",
    "Weaknesses": "The Chakra JIT engine incorrectly optimizes arguments in a function when a function declaration with the same name as a formal parameter is present within a block scope. The parser fails to detect this scenario during scope binding.",
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to type confusion in JITed code, potentially resulting in denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific JavaScript code structure and executing it in Microsoft Edge.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute malicious javascript code within the scope of a vulnerable Microsoft Edge browser instance.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs because the 'HasAnyWriteToFormals' check in 'Parser::BindPidRefsInScope' does not correctly identify the described problematic scope. This causes the JIT compiler to perform an incorrect optimization, leading to the type confusion."
