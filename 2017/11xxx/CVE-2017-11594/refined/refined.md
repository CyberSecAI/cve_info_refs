Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the "href" attribute in Markdown links. This allowed a malicious user to inject JavaScript code directly into a link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. Specifically, a stored XSS vulnerability as the malicious link is stored within the thread description and executed when a user views the content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when the user clicks on the malicious link. This could potentially allow the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies and other sensitive information
    - Redirect the user to a malicious site
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Markdown Link Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious Markdown link with a `javascript:` URL into a thread description.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks on the crafted link.
- The vulnerability could also be exploited via comments within threads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Account:** The attacker needs an account on the Loomio platform to create a new thread or post a comment.
- **Ability to create content:** The attacker has to be able to create content with markdown.
- **User Interaction:** Requires the victim to click the malicious link.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Loomio version 1.8.0.
- The fix involved sanitizing the "href" attribute of links.
- The commit `63973f7` addresses this vulnerability by adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to the link tag and sanitizing the input.
- The original report of the issue was on March 2, 2017 by the user Framartin.
- The vulnerability existed both in thread descriptions and in comments posted within a thread.
