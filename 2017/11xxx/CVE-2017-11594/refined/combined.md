## Description

[![@Framartin](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1850174?u=91c5025161b242fa4d512b777339c5460eecd4a9&v=4&size=48)](/Framartin)[Framartin](https://github.com/Framartin)opened [on Jul 21, 2017](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/issues/4220#issue-244763605)

For transparency reason, the email I sent to Loomio maintainers on March 2, 2017 is reproduced below. This XSS vulnerability was fixed by this commit: [63973f7](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/commit/63973f71e337ead8ca7b7ae2a043b837032dc3fe)

This fix was shipped with [Loomio v1.8.0](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/releases/tag/1.8.0)

> Hello,
>
> I just found an XSS vulnerability in Loomio.
>
> **How to reproduce**
>
> * A malicious user creates an new thread
> * In the description, (s)he enters: `[my link](javascript:alert('xss'&#41;)`
> * The targeted user visits the thread and clicks on the malicious link
> * The JS payload is executed
>
> **How to fix**
>
> "href" content should be sanitized
>
> I found this vulnerability because I'm currently and voluntarily
>
> searching for XSS vulnerabilities in the services that we offer or use
>
> at the French non-profit association Framasoft.
>
> I remain available for any additional comments or questions.
>
> Best,
>
> Martin

Thanks to the Loomio developers for the fix.

Edit: Note that it was also possible to exploit this vulnerability by posting a comment inside a thread.
