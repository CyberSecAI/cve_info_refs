ACPICA: Namespace: fix operand cache leakACPICA commit a23325b2e583556eae88ed3f764e457786bf4df6
I found some ACPI operand cache leaks in ACPI early abort cases.

When early abort is occurred due to invalid ACPI information, Linux kernel
terminates ACPI by calling acpi\_terminate() function. The function calls
acpi\_ns\_terminate() function to delete namespace data and ACPI operand cache
(acpi\_gbl\_module\_code\_list).
But the deletion code in acpi\_ns\_terminate() function is wrapped in
ACPI\_EXEC\_APP definition, therefore the code is only executed when the
definition exists. If the define doesn't exist, ACPI operand cache
(acpi\_gbl\_module\_code\_list) is leaked, and stack dump is shown in kernel log.
This causes a security threat because the old kernel (<= 4.9) shows memory
locations of kernel functions in stack dump, therefore kernel ASLR can be
neutralized.
To fix ACPI operand leak for enhancing security, I made a patch which
removes the ACPI\_EXEC\_APP define in acpi\_ns\_terminate() function for
executing the deletion code unconditionally.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

It was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an

incorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-10940](/security/CVE-2018-10940))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Daniel Jiang discovered that a race condition existed in the ipv4 ping

socket implementation in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-2671](/security/CVE-2017-2671))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-10021](/security/CVE-2018-10021))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3619-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16995](/security/CVE-2017-16995))

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed in

the ACPI implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory addresses).

([CVE-2017-11472](/security/CVE-2017-11472))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15129](/security/CVE-2017-15129))

It was discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free when handling

device removal. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-16528](/security/CVE-2017-16528))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the usbtest device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate endpoint metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16532](/security/CVE-2017-16532))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the Conexant cx231xx USB video capture

driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate interface descriptors.

A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2017-16536](/security/CVE-2017-16536))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SoundGraph iMON USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2017-16537](/security/CVE-2017-16537))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IMS Passenger Control Unit USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device descriptors. A

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

ACPICA commit a23325b2e583556eae88ed3f764e457786bf4df6

I found some ACPI operand cache leaks in ACPI early abort cases.

Boot log of ACPI operand cache leak is as follows:

When early abort is occurred due to invalid ACPI information, Linux kernel
terminates ACPI by calling acpi_terminate() function. The function calls
acpi_ns_terminate() function to delete namespace data and ACPI operand cache
(acpi_gbl_module_code_list).

But the deletion code in acpi_ns_terminate() function is wrapped in
ACPI_EXEC_APP definition, therefore the code is only executed when the
definition exists. If the define doesn't exist, ACPI operand cache
(acpi_gbl_module_code_list) is leaked, and stack dump is shown in kernel log.

This causes a security threat because the old kernel (<= 4.9) shows memory
locations of kernel functions in stack dump, therefore kernel ASLR can be
neutralized.

To fix ACPI operand leak for enhancing security, I made a patch which
removes the ACPI_EXEC_APP define in acpi_ns_terminate() function for
executing the deletion code unconditionally.

When early abort is occurred due to invalid ACPI information, Linux kernel
terminates ACPI by calling AcpiTerminate() function. The function calls
AcpiNsTerminate() function to delete namespace data and ACPI operand cache
(AcpiGbl_ModuleCodeList).

But the deletion code in AcpiNsTerminate() function is wrapped in
ACPI_EXEC_APP definition, therefore the code is only executed when the
definition exists. If the define doesn't exist, ACPI operand cache
(AcpiGbl_ModuleCodeList) is leaked, and stack dump is shown in kernel log.

This causes a security threat because the old kernel (<= 4.9) shows memory
locations of kernel functions in stack dump, therefore kernel ASLR can be
neutralized.

To fix ACPI operand leak for enhancing security, I made a patch which
removes the ACPI_EXEC_APP define in AcpiNsTerminate() function for
executing the deletion code unconditionally.
