{
  "vulnerability": "CVE-2017-11472",
  "description": "It was discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed in the ACPI implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory addresses).",
  "affected_component": "ACPI implementation of the Linux kernel",
  "root_cause": "The deletion code in `acpi_ns_terminate()` function, responsible for freeing the ACPI operand cache (`acpi_gbl_module_code_list`), was conditionally executed based on the `ACPI_EXEC_APP` definition. When this definition was not present, the operand cache was not freed during ACPI termination, resulting in a memory leak.",
  "weakness": "Conditional execution of memory cleanup code leading to resource leak and information disclosure.",
  "impact": "A local attacker could potentially gain knowledge of kernel memory locations via stack dumps. This could be used to neutralize Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), which is a security feature designed to make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.",
  "attack_vector": "Local access is required to trigger an early abort of the ACPI initialization due to invalid ACPI information, causing the vulnerable code path to be executed during ACPI termination.",
  "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the ACPI early abort condition.",
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability was addressed by removing the `ACPI_EXEC_APP` condition in `acpi_ns_terminate()`, forcing the deletion code to be executed unconditionally. The vulnerable code was present in Linux kernels <= 4.9. The patch was also applied to the ACPICA project itself."
