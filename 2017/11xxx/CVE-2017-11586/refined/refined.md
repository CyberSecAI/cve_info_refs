The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in FineCMS before v5.0.9, and **CVE-2017-11586** is listed as one of them.  The specific vulnerability associated with this CVE is not explicitly stated in the article and instead several vulnerabilities are listed together. Based on the blog post, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. URL Redirector Abuse**

*   **Root Cause:** The `sync` function in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/Weixin.php` does not properly validate the `url` parameter, allowing redirection to arbitrary URLs.
*   **Weakness:** Unvalidated user-controlled input used in redirection.
*   **Impact:** Users can be redirected to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware infections.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A crafted URL containing a malicious destination within the `url` parameter, accessed via the `c=weixin&m=sync` handler.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL for redirection, no authentication is needed.

**2. Reflected XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** The username field in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/admin/Login.php` is not properly sanitized when an error occurs during login. Input is only filtered for starting with `<`, allowing for DOM-based XSS.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input sanitization/output encoding leading to XSS
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker would attempt to login to the admin panel with a malicious username.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker must be able to access the login page and input a malicious username to trigger the XSS.

**3. api.php Reflected XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** The `data2` function in `/finecms/dayrui/controllers/api.php` outputs a function parameter directly into the page without validation if the function does not exist.
*   **Weakness:** Unvalidated parameter output directly to the page.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser leading to XSS.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL with a malicious script in the `function` parameter, accessed via `c=api&m=data2`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must craft a URL with the malicious payload.

**4. SQL injection in action=related catid parameter**

*   **Root Cause:** The `catid` parameter in the `list_tag` function of `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php` with `action=related` is split by `,` and directly injected into a SQL query without validation.
*   **Weakness:** Unsanitized SQL input leading to SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A crafted URL with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `catid` parameter. Requires a valid `auth` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must obtain the `SYS_KEY` from the cookie to craft a valid `auth` parameter.

**5. SQL injection after limit via $system[num] parameter**

*   **Root Cause:** The `num` parameter in the `list_tag` function of `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php` with `action=tags` or `action=related` is directly inserted into a SQL query without sanitization. This vulnerability is exploitable using `PROCEDURE ANALYSE` in MySQL versions before 5.6.6.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries leading to data breaches, using a specific version of MySQL with `PROCEDURE ANALYSE`
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL with a malicious SQL payload using `PROCEDURE ANALYSE` within the `num` parameter and valid `auth` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must obtain the `SYS_KEY` from the cookie to craft a valid `auth` parameter and have knowledge of the mysql version.

**6. SQL injection via $system[field] parameter**

*  **Root Cause:** The `field` parameter within the `list_tag` function in `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php` with `action=related`, `action=form`, `action=member` or `action=module` is directly injected into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization of the `field` parameter in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** SQL injection allowing for data breaches.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A crafted URL with a SQL injection payload in the `field` parameter, with valid `auth` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must obtain the `SYS_KEY` from the cookie to craft a valid `auth` parameter.

**7. Remote PHP code execution**

*   **Root Cause:** The `list_tag` function with `action=cache` in `/finecms/dayrui/libraries/Template.php` is vulnerable because the `$_param` parameter bypasses filters and is directly used in `eval()`, allowing execution of arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Weakness:** Use of `eval()` with unfiltered user input.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A crafted URL using a malicious payload in the `name` parameter with `action=cache` along with a valid `auth` parameter.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must obtain the `SYS_KEY` from the cookie to craft a valid `auth` parameter.

**Summary:**

The provided content details several vulnerabilities within FineCMS, including URL redirection, multiple XSS vulnerabilities and multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities and a remote code execution. These vulnerabilities stem from improper input sanitization and lack of output encoding across different parts of the application, leading to a variety of potential attack scenarios including data breaches and complete system compromise through remote code execution.
