Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-11211

**Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length heap buffer within ImageConversion's JPEG parsing.

**Vulnerability/Weakness:**
*   **Heap Overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer in the heap memory region.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a buffer, leading to the overflow if the supplied data exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the Acrobat/Reader process). This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** The attacker can craft a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted JPEG image that triggers the vulnerability when parsed by Adobe Acrobat/Reader.
*   **Malicious Page:** The attacker can host a malicious web page that contains the crafted JPEG and attempts to exploit the vulnerability when opened using Adobe Acrobat/Reader in a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, and does not require any prior access to the target system.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction; the target user must either open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `ImageConversion` component during JPEG parsing in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) identified and reported this vulnerability, referencing it as ZDI-17-579.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection against this vulnerability using filter ID `28218`.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2017-03-23 and a coordinated public release was made on 2017-08-08.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" by Adobe.
